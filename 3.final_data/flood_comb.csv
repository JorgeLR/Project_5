Several Midwestern states are reeling from historic flooding which hit the area a few weeks ago.
Thousands of people have been evacuated, and vast swathes of farmland has been destroyed. 
For many in Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota the recovery effort has been slow and painful, as people return to their homes.
As images of submerged farms were broadcast across the country, many looked for ways to help.
Here are some of the acts of kindness to emerge in the wake of the devastation.
'Any shoes are better than wet shoes'
When Addy Tritt, 25, noticed her local discount shoe shop was closing down she decided to buy out their entire stock.
Ms Tritt then donated the 204 pairs of shoes, valued at $6,000 (£4,555), to families affected by the floods. 
""I wanted them to go to people who actually needed them,"" Ms Tritt told CBS News.
After spending two hours negotiating with the the shop's head office, Ms Tritt paid just $100 (£76) for the entire stock.

 Addy Tritt donated 204 pairs of shoes to Nebraska flood victims
Of Ms Tritt's haul, 162 pairs were baby shoes, two were men's shoes and the rest were women's, according to the the Associated Press.
""Any shoes are better than wet shoes,"" Ms Tritt said. ""If people feel lost, they should try volunteering and donating. It gives me such fulfilment and I want others to feel the way I do.""
The shoes were part of a shipment to Nebraska farmers organised by a local student agricultural group. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said farmers were some of the worst affected by ""the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our state's history"".
'Island hopping in Nebraska!'
With many roads in the region made impassable by floodwater, some volunteers took to the skies to rescue stranded residents. 
Adam Marshall, has been a private pilot for three years, and when he started to receive calls for help from people trapped in the nearby town of Fremont he fired up his small propeller plane. 
Mr Marshall told CNN that he has made more than 30 trips, and described it as ""island hopping in Nebraska"".
""My phone just started blowing up, and I told my wife, 'I think I'm going to be gone for a couple of days'.""
""I transported the entire Midland University dance team to Omaha so they wouldn't miss their commercial flight and a woman named Allie who has five kids and had been cut off from her family,"" he said.
Surrounded by rising floodwaters, Gary Fouraker was rushed to hospital after doctors suspected he had blood clots in his lungs. 
However, there was no room for his wife Marcia to travel with him in the helicopter. 
""I've never been scared like I was [at that point]"", Ms Fouraker told CNN. ""The roads weren't open.""
Mr Marshall came to her rescue, delivering Ms Fouraker to her husband's bedside an hour later. 
""I just really admire the way he, and so many other pilots, have really stepped up to help people,"" Ms Fouraker said.
""Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride,"" Mr Marshall reflected. ""I got a lot of hugs the last few days!""
'I've never escorted hay'
Derek Jilek, from North Dakota, knew he wanted to help when he saw photos of flooded farms across the Midwest. 
He posted on Facebook calling on his ""farm and ranch neighbours"" to donate a few hay bales to those who had been hit by the floods. 
Vast swathes of farmland was destroyed by the floodwater, and many farmers have struggled to feed their livestock.
What started as a small effort to collect donations, turned into a nine truck convoy carrying thousands of dollars worth of farming supplies and equipment. 
""I guess when you're helping or volunteering, I always heard that you do what you know. We know cows and we know trucking, so that's what we did,"" Mr Jilek told local news station WOWT. 
The convoy received a police escort for part of the 600 mile (965km) journey, with a new police department taking over as the trucks crossed county boundaries.
Sgt Dan Kensinger, from the Stark County Sheriff's Department, said, ""This was new to me. We've done funeral escorts and various other things.

 Queensland's northern cattle region was devastated by floods in February
Like many other Australian graziers, Matt Bennetto could only start to count the dead after the rain had stopped.
Flying in a helicopter over his sodden cattle station, he was confronted by the ""nightmare"" of mass cattle losses.
Animals were strewn across pastures which had turned into water and mud.
""We probably flew over 10,000 carcasses that day, just going over my place and the neighbours',"" he told the BBC.
His cattle at Julia Creek were among an estimated 500,000 livestock wiped out when a flood disaster hit northern Queensland earlier this month.
Image copyrightCOWAN DOWNS STATION/REUTERSImage caption
 Animals seek higher ground to escape the waters
""To see them all dead along the fence lines and in the corners - can you imagine that scene?"" he said.
""You spend your whole life trying to breed beautiful animals and then you see something like that. It's beyond heartbreaking.""
Massive rainfall
Queensland's cattle industry, worth A$8.6bn (£4.7bn; $6bn), is reeling after the losses in the state's north.
Rain pummelled 13 million hectares of dedicated farming land - an area about the size of England - killing a third of cattle there. The bulk of flooding stretched, in rough terms, between towns Normanton and Winton.
Some areas received three times their average annual rainfall in a week. 
At first the deluge was welcomed by farmers, who had sustained their cattle through years of drought. 
But as waters rose, the situation quickly turned and led to animals drowning. Many more died from exposure to the elements.
""These cattle are bred in hot, dry conditions,"" Mr Bennetto said. ""Right before the rain they had gone through a week of over 40-degree [Celsius] temperatures.
""For an animal who can live in such extreme heat, they're not good at surviving in that cold rain.""
Logistical challenges
The Queensland floods have come in an Australian summer that has been marked by natural disasters.
A number of other mass wildlife deaths have been recorded amid record-breaking heatwaves, and bushfires have destroyed homes in three states.
In the coastal Queensland city of Townsville, floodwaters led to two deaths.

Further west, in the region of the mass cattle deaths, the floodwaters have receded but a crisis remains.
""Producers are attempting to save as many cattle as possible, getting them out of mud and water, and providing them with fodder and medical attention,"" said Michael Guerin, head of AgForce, the industry's peak body in Queensland.
The army has helped bury carcasses and fly hay bales to surviving animals.

Charles Adler from Rural Aid, a charity which organised drop-offs, described it as a logistical challenge.
""Some of these stations are 150km long, so finding alive cattle was a very difficult exercise. And then they're scattered everywhere in small mobs, so we're ferrying bales by chopper one at a time,"" he said.
He said animals stuck in mud were starving, while others were dying from shock, pneumonia and Three Day Sickness - a bovine fever spread by mosquitoes. 
Another grazier, Rachael Anderson, has lost at least 2,000 animals - about half of her herd - at her station in Julia Creek. She said the numbers were continuing to rise.
""We had lots of mothers birth just after the rain, but then die from exhaustion. So I'm hand-rearing 12 calves but there will be more,"" she said.
""Lots of people are in the same boat. We are just saving whatever lives we can.""
'Rebuilding from scratch'
The estimated half a million deaths represent only a portion of Australia's total cattle industry, which numbers about 27 million. 
But for northern Queensland, the toll is immense.

 An area the size of England was flooded, authorities say
Authorities have put the combined financial loss for about 800 graziers at more than A$5bn. Some farms will not have cash flow for up to three years, AgForce warns.
The region's industry now has to ""rebuild itself almost from scratch"", according to Mr Guerin. He said restocking may take years, while replacing prized ""bloodlines"" could take decades.
Some graziers find it almost too hard to contemplate. As Mr Adler said: ""They've struggled for seven years to keep their animals alive in the drought, and now they're left with the futility of all that.""
Mr Bennetto, who lost more than 70% of his livestock, said he had chosen to suspend operations at his station for now.
""We're just not in a position to come back right now,"" he said. ""Maybe in a couple of months, we can get back on our feet and keep going. But I've already started a new job this week just so we can afford to pay our bills.""

 Rebuilding will be a very long process, graziers say
The government has offered up to A$75,000 in aid for each grazier.
But Ms Anderson said recovery would be ""very, very hard"", and in her case take at least 10 years.

 Queensland's northern cattle region was devastated by floods in February
Like many other Australian graziers, Matt Bennetto could only start to count the dead after the rain had stopped.
Flying in a helicopter over his sodden cattle station, he was confronted by the ""nightmare"" of mass cattle losses.
Animals were strewn across pastures which had turned into water and mud.
""We probably flew over 10,000 carcasses that day, just going over my place and the neighbours',"" he told the BBC.
His cattle at Julia Creek were among an estimated 500,000 livestock wiped out when a flood disaster hit northern Queensland earlier this month.

 Animals seek higher ground to escape the waters
""To see them all dead along the fence lines and in the corners - can you imagine that scene?"" he said.
""You spend your whole life trying to breed beautiful animals and then you see something like that. It's beyond heartbreaking.""
Massive rainfall
Queensland's cattle industry, worth A$8.6bn (£4.7bn; $6bn), is reeling after the losses in the state's north.
Rain pummelled 13 million hectares of dedicated farming land - an area about the size of England - killing a third of cattle there. The bulk of flooding stretched, in rough terms, between towns Normanton and Winton.
Some areas received three times their average annual rainfall in a week. 
At first the deluge was welcomed by farmers, who had sustained their cattle through years of drought. 
But as waters rose, the situation quickly turned and led to animals drowning. Many more died from exposure to the elements.
""These cattle are bred in hot, dry conditions,"" Mr Bennetto said. ""Right before the rain they had gone through a week of over 40-degree [Celsius] temperatures.
""For an animal who can live in such extreme heat, they're not good at surviving in that cold rain.""
Logistical challenges
The Queensland floods have come in an Australian summer that has been marked by natural disasters.
A number of other mass wildlife deaths have been recorded amid record-breaking heatwaves, and bushfires have destroyed homes in three states.
In the coastal Queensland city of Townsville, floodwaters led to two deaths.

 The town of Sentani was one of the worst affected areas
At least 58 people have been killed in flash floods in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.
Rescue workers are struggling to reach remote parts of the province, and there are fears the number of dead may rise.
Roads have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, and floodwaters have damaged two bridges and more than 100 houses.
More than 4,000 people have been forced from their homes, and some are sheltering in government offices.
Local residents said torrential rain began on Saturday evening and continued into the night, triggering mudslides and flash floods.

""Our house was flooded with thick mud... we immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbour's [two-storey] house to seek refuge,"" said mother-of-two Lili Puji Hastuti, quoted by Agence France-Presse.
""It's hard to get out of the area because many roads are blocked... I'm worried, sad and scared all at once.""
The search for victims continues in the town of Sentani, one of the worst affected areas. 
Fifty-one people were killed in the town, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, quoted by Reuters news agency.
The other seven confirmed deaths were in the nearby provincial capital Jayapura, Mr Nugroho added.
However, a five-month-old baby was rescued in the city after being trapped under the rubble for hours, according to the military.
Meanwhile a propeller aircraft was partly crushed on the runway of Jayapura airport.
Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the October-April rainy season.
In January, floods killed at least 70 people on the island of Sulawesi, and heavy rain in West Java earlier in March displaced hundreds.
Emergency officials say that in recent months they had warned the Papuan authorities of flood risks due to deforestation of mountains surrounding Jayapura.

 Cyclone Idai is an ""unprecedented natural disaster"" that no-one could have predicted, a Mozambican minister has said
The UN has said the final casualty figure after Cyclone Idai tore through southern Africa more than a week ago will only be known once the flood waters have receded. 
At least 417 people have now been declared dead in Mozambique, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia has said.
The new figure puts the overall death toll at about 700 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
It is expected to rise further.
The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Saturday that the Buzi and Zambezi rivers were at risk of breaking their banks again.
""We're going to have to wait until the flood waters recede until we know the full expanse of the toll on the people of Mozambique,"" OCHA co-ordinator Sebastian Rhodes Stampa said.
Thousands remain trapped by the floodwaters, and many of the Mozambican government's relief centres have only just started receiving food supplies - more than a week after the storm first struck. 
Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods.
Media caption'It has become an inland sea'
On Friday, cases of cholera were recorded in Beira in central Mozambique.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria.
Idai made landfall near Beira, a city of 500,000 people, with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March.
Aid workers are slowly delivering relief, but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and helicopters scarce.
Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. 
Nearly 90,000 Mozambicans are thought to be sheltering in temporary sites, while thousands of others are still stranded in floodwaters, AFP news agency reports.
""We are living an unprecedented natural disaster. A disaster that only matches major disasters,"" Mr Correia said.

 A man wades through flood water up to his thighs in Townsville
Authorities in Townsville, Australia have warned residents to beware of crocodiles and snakes spotted in floodwaters in residential areas.
More than 1,100 people have been evacuated from the town amid a ""once in a century"" flood.
On Sunday, the city authorities released a dam which had swollen to double its capacity following a week of record rainfall.
Authorities have said more heavy rain is expected in coming days.
Up to 20,000 homes are at risk of being inundated.

 One crocodile was spotted lurking on a suburban driveway in Townsville
Emergency workers and the army said they had received more than 1,000 calls for help. They've been using boats and helicopters to move people to higher ground.
""Crocodiles may be seen crossing roads, and when flooding recedes, crocodiles can turn up in unusual places such as farm dams or waterholes,"" said Queensland's Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch.
""Similarly, snakes are very good swimmers and they too may turn up unexpectedly.""
One local resident, Erin Hahn, shared pictures of a crocodile sitting in shallow water at the end of her father's drive. Another was photographed climbing a tree in the floodwater. 
Local police also warned people of other dangers in the floodwater, including leaking sewage.
Townsville has received more than a metre (3.3ft) of rain in the past week - more than 20 times the average for the time of year.
""This is unprecedented, we've never seen anything like this before,"" said Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.
""It's basically not just a one-in-20-year event, it's a one-in-100-year event,"" she said.

Northern Queensland has a tropical climate and experiences monsoon rain from December to April. But the current conditions in the Townsville area are rare.

January was the hottest month on record for Australia as a whole, with the southern city of Adelaide breaking its own records twice in the month, first reaching 47.7C and then 49.5C. 
The heat has sparked bushfires, including more than 40 blazes on the island state of Tasmania which have been burning for over two weeks.

 Guerneville residents are forced to travel by canoe through their neighbourhood
Two towns in northern California's wine-making region have been turned into virtual islands by record-breaking floodwaters, say authorities.
Sonoma County authorities, about 70 miles (110km) north of San Francisco, said about 3,600 people were evacuated after the Russian River flooded.
Torrential rain and snowfall has triggered the worst deluge in over 20 years, emergency officials say.
The towns of Monte Rio and Guerneville are currently only accessible by boat.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Flooding also submerged the shopping district of the nearby town of Sebastopol
""You cannot get into or out of town,"" Sonoma County officials said on Wednesday night in a mandatory evacuation order. ""Guerneville is officially an island.""
Around 2,000 homes and businesses are currently underwater, Ms Khan said, adding that only around half of the 4,500 residents complied with the official warning to leave.
A hotel popular among tourists who came to see the region's famed vineyards was evacuated, according to KGO-TV.
A guest there from North Carolina told the station that she ""made a decision to take the rental car through the waist-high water and got two-thirds of the way and then the car stalled"".

Nina Sheehan said it was a mistake to have tried to pass by vehicle. 
Emergency crews always warn people against ever driving through water over 1ft (30cm) deep. Two feet of water can wash away most cars, according to the National Weather Service.
Members of the National Guard were seen towing kayaks, canoes, and jet-skis to the water's edge.
One trapped woman suffered a medical issue and was evacuated by helicopter, the sheriff's office said.

 Grape fields are underwater in California's wine-producing region
A nearby mudslide, as well as downed trees, is also cutting off road access on Bohemian Highway.
One man, who was trapped with his wife in their vehicle by a mudslide, told KGO-TV that trees were falling all around them as the mud pushed them downhill.
""Oh, they just flew down every which way. They just came running down the hill, these big trees,"" he said.
Image copyrightGetty Images
By Wednesday night the Russian River crested at 45ft - nearly 14ft above flood stage - before beginning to recede.
In nearby Sebastopol, the Laguna de Santa Rosa wetlands rose high enough to swamp the town's main shopping district.
More rain is forecast in the coming days, weather officials warn, and an increased snowpack in several western states could continue to keep water levels higher than average.","The only way to access the towns, which are under mandatory evacuation, is by boat.",,2019-02-28,BBC News,Floods and mudslides turn California wine towns to 'islands',,"Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
