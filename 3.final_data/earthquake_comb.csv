1610,No author,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.7 earthquake hit the coast of north-central Chile on Saturday evening, the U.S. Geological Survey said. 
The quake struck at 10:32 p.m. local time (0132 GMT) about 15.6 km (9.7 miles) south-southwest of Coquimbo, the USGS said. The relatively shallow quake, just 53 km (33 miles) below the surface, rattled buildings in the capital city of Santiago. 
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center discarded a tsunami threat shortly after the tremor. 
No initial damage or injuries have been reported, though there were sporadic reports of power outages near the epicenter of the quake. 
Chilean miner Antofagasta Plc said operations were normal at its Los Pelambres copper mine following the nearby earthquake.

1634,No author,"Lima, Peru -- A very powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck southern Ecuador in the early hours of Friday close to the country's border with Peru, although no immediate reports of possible casualties or damage were available. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake happened at 10:17 GMT 115 kilometers (71 miles) southeast of the town of Palora, in the Morona Santiago province, at a depth of 132 kilometers (82 miles).
The quake was felt in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, and the coastal city of Guayaquil.
Peru's official geophysics institute said it registered two aftershocks of 6.06 and 6.6 magnitude in the 30 minutes that followed the first tremor.
Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno said on his official Twitter account that ""preliminary reports of the quakes near Macas (the provincial capital of Morona Santiago) don't show major damage.""
The quakes, he wrote, ""were felt all over the country.""
People posted video and images to social media after the quake.

1982,No author,"A strong 6.2 magnitude earthquake was reported off the coast of Ecuador early Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
The United States Geological Survey said the temblor occurred around 3 a.m. ET about 16 miles north of Santa Elena along the coast.
The quake struck at a depth of about 11 miles, according to the agency. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Center reported that there were also numerous aftershocks following the initial quake.

7.1-MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE HITS SOUTHERN PERU
Ecuador lies along the Pacific's so-called ""Ring of Fire,"" a 25,000-mile horseshoe-shaped ring, accounting for approximately 90 percent of the world's earthquakes, according to the USGS.
The region is the location of most of Earth's subduction zones, where oceanic plates slide under the lighter continental plates. Earthquakes tend to happen when those plates scrape or subside underneath each other, and when that happens at sea it can spawn tsunamis.

2056,No author,"LA SERENA (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.7 earthquake hit the coast of north-central Chile on Saturday evening, the U.S. Geological Survey said, and witnesses said it rattled buildings farther south in the capital city of Santiago but left only minor damage in its wake. 
The quake struck at 10:32 p.m. local time (0132 GMT) about 15.6 km (9.7 miles) south-southwest of Coquimbo, the USGS said. The quake was 53 km (33 miles) below the surface, a relatively shallow tremor that shook homes and had some worried about a possible tsunami. 
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, however, quickly discarded a tsunami threat following the tremor. 
A Reuters witness reported minor damage to older buildings and power outages in the nearby coastal city of La Serena, a popular beach town about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Santiago. 
“It felt very strong...the tourists were very nervous, but nothing serious happened,” Camila Castillo, a receptionist at a hotel in La Serena, told Reuters. 
Chilean miner Antofagasta Plc said operations were normal at its Los Pelambres copper mine following the nearby earthquake. 
Chile, located on the so-called “Pacific Ring of Fire,” has a long history of deadly quakes, including a 8.8 magnitude quake in 2010 off the south-central coast, which also triggered a tsunami that devastated coastal towns. 
But death and destruction are limited by strict construction codes especially designed to withstand earthquakes.
