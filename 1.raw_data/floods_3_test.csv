"The aid group said it had seen hundreds of cases of acute watery diarrhea in the past few days, though the germs responsible often were not known.
The scale of extreme damage will likely lead to a dramatic increase of waterborne diseases, skin infections, respiratory tract infections and malaria in the coming days and weeks, said Gert Verdonck, the groups emergency coordinator in Beira.
Hurried efforts were underway to restore running water to Beira. The United Nations childrens agency said parts of the citys water supply system were working again, with water running in 60 percent of the pipes. The government also was operating water trucks.
With roads submerged or damaged, Beira remains accessibly primarily by air and sea, and relief agencies continued on Wednesday to explore ways to deliver more aid to the city. Even more challenging was reaching rural communities, some of them still without contact with the outside world.
More humanitarian groups arrived as the United Nations urged the international community to fund a $282 million emergency appeal for the next three months.
The United Nations refugee agency announced that its first aid flight had landed in the capital, Maputo, with plans to take tents, mosquito nets and other items to Beira. Two other flights are planned for Zimbabwe and Malawi this week.","With vast areas submerged by contaminated water, officials warned that more cases of potentially lethal, waterborne diseases should be expected.",2019-03-27T15:49:20Z,Cholera Outbreak Raises New Danger in Flood-Ravaged Mozambique,The New York Times,0
"Finding settings that amplify an operas drama has long been Mr. Einhorns mission. Since 2012, On Site Opera, which he helped found, has put on productions in unusual spaces, including the Bronx Zoo (Shostakovichs The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse), a church crypt (Gregg Kallors The Tell-Tale Heart) and Madame Tussauds (Rameaus Pygmalion). But in telling the story of the crippled shepherd boy Amahl and his life-changing encounter with the three kings drawn by the star of Bethlehem, Mr. Einhorn decided to find not only the right place, but also the right people. Speaking of the backgrounds of his amateur choristers, who will share the stage with professional musicians, Mr. Einhorn said he had taken care to be sensitive to who these people are and never to go into an exploitative territory in how we talk about them, or how we fold their experiences into the production itself. Printed programs will reflect some of the biographies of the singers. But even without these, audience members may pick up, here and there, on the signs of past deprivation that appear etched into faces.

"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

"Many of the levees, usually earthen and topped with grass, were built by farmers decades ago and are now managed by a patchwork of local government agencies known as levee districts that often do not coordinate or even follow the same rules. With increased flooding in the past few years, the levees are being tested more frequently than ever before, straining the finances and expertise of some of those districts. The levee situation has become so grave that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the countrys levee system a D grade in 2017, suggesting $80 billion in investment over 10 years.
When the next one comes along bigger, they either fail or are overtopped again, said Nicholas Pinter, an expert on rivers and flooding at the University of California, Davis.
According to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees infrastructure on the Missouri River and some of its tributaries, at least 62 levees had been breached or overtopped in the Midwest in March, and hundreds of miles of levees had sustained damage.
When they run water over the top of them, theres not anything you can do, said Pat Sheldon, the president of a rural levee district in southwest Iowa that was still paying off repairs from the 2011 flood. This time, Mr. Sheldon said, the damage to the levees was much worse, perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Its terrible, said Mr. Sheldon, whose farm was also cut off by the water.
In Missouri, Mr. Bullock pointed out a levee that last week had been split open and consumed by the river. A large log swirled in the water near where the earthen berm should have been. I dont know what were going to do this time, he said.
The Army Corps of Engineers, which helps determine water levels by operating a series of dams on the Missouri River, tries to balance the needs of many who use the rivers it manages, including farmers, barge shippers, endangered animal species and people who use the water for recreation. Those interests are sometimes at odds, and have been the subject of decades of litigation. Corps officials say they are not allowed to change the congressionally authorized purposes of the reservoirs, though they had been most focused on limiting floods for the past year.
The Corpss No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety, said Maj. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, the Corpss deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations, in a statement. Our current focus is to protect life, mitigate risks to flooding events and repair damages due to the recent events in the basin.","Hundreds of miles of levees in the Midwest have been overwhelmed by the floods, leaving “Swiss cheese” infrastructure and reigniting a flood control debate.",2019-03-31T09:00:10Z,"‘Breaches Everywhere’: Midwest Levees Burst, and Tough Questions Follow",The New York Times,0
"Many of the works in Programmed: Rules, Codes and Choreographies in Art, 1965-2018, an exhibition at the Whitney Museum, require an electrical outlet. The presentation drawn mostly from the museums collection involves much in the way of video projections, lights, television sets, voice-overs, soundtracks, computers, computer programs and, in the most recent efforts, touch screens.
Yet regardless of whether power sources are needed, all the artworks use algorithms. That is, they are executed according to plans, instructions, numerical systems, or, as the shows subtitle indicates, rules, codes and choreographies. The analog examples tend to be foundational works of Minimal and Conceptual Art: Donald Judds 1965 aluminum relief based on the Fibonacci numerical sequence; a Sol LeWitt wall drawing from 1976 executed to written directions applicable to walls of any dimension; and Joseph Kosuths string of five words in green neon that reads Five Words in Green Neon (1965).

"In the states appeal, titled, as is the other Indiana case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Indiana complains that the appeals court said nothing about the ultrasounds utility in helping women to come to a better, more informed abortion decision. The state claims that Planned Parenthood, which operates the four abortion clinics, could mitigate this burden by equipping its other reproductive health centers around the state with ultrasound equipment.
While the state defends the ultrasound requirement as protecting fetal life and dignity as well as maternal mental health, it doesnt explain how the new 18-hour requirement improves on the old law. No matter. Its not hard to envision five justices using this case to whittle down the undue burden standard as the Supreme Court applied it before Justice Anthony Kennedys retirement last year and as the Seventh Circuit has been applying it in recent months. The court will consider this case in April, after it receives Planned Parenthoods response to the states petition.
Of all the recent rulings, the decision that took me most by surprise and gives me the most concern was handed down two weeks ago by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court upheld an Ohio law that bars state public health money from going to any organization that performs abortions. For any organization read Planned Parenthood, which receives no public money for abortions, but that for years has administered government grants for six public health programs, including H.I.V. testing, cancer screening and sexual violence prevention. Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of H.I.V. testing in Cleveland, Akron and Canton. It performs abortions at three of its 27 clinics in the state.
After then-Gov. John Kasich signed the law in 2016, Planned Parenthood sued on the ground that the state was imposing an unconstitutional condition by requiring it to forfeit its right to provide abortions in order to remain eligible for the unrelated public health grants. A Federal District Court barred the law from taking effect, in a decision upheld by a three-judge panel of the appeals court. But fortified by the addition of four Trump-appointed judges, the full court reheard the case and voted 11 to 6 to reverse the panel and uphold the law, with all the new judges in the majority.
I found Judge Jeffrey Suttons opinion for the court astonishing. He wrote that Planned Parenthood had no right to invoke the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions because while women have a right to obtain abortions, neither Planned Parenthood nor any other abortion provider has the right to perform them. As he explained: If theres no right, theres no unconstitutional condition. And the providers have no such constitutional right.
Judge Sutton, named to the appeals court by President George W. Bush, is a thoughtful conservative whom Ive long respected. Ive struggled to understand what led him to his conclusion. Since the earliest years of the Supreme Courts abortion jurisprudence, both the Supreme Court and the lower courts have regarded doctors and clinics as standing in the shoes of their abortion patients, entitled to assert rights that individual women are highly unlikely to be in a position to assert.
The precedents are clear on this crucial point, in case after case, court after court. As Judge Helene White wrote in dissent, An abortion providers constitutional right may be derivative of the patients right but it is a right nonetheless. She continued: The majoritys reasoning contorts a doctrine that aims to prevent the government from manipulating rights out of existence, to permit the state to leverage its funding to launch a thinly veiled attack on womens rights so long as it camouflages its unconstitutional condition in provider-focused verbiage. (On Monday of this week, a federal district judge in North Carolina, William L. Osteen Jr., struck down that states ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, finding that doctors themselves had standing to bring the case because of their plausible fear of prosecution if they interpreted the statutes health exception too generously in the view of state prosecutors.)
I dont know whether Planned Parenthood will appeal the Ohio decision, Planned Parenthood v. Hodges. Its received little attention not surprisingly. As framed by the appeals court, its not the kind of issue that sends culture warriors to the barricades. But theres no chance that the justices will miss its significance. Is it the small-target case they have been waiting for? Could be. As my favorite poet, Edna St. Vincent Millay, wrote in an obviously different context:
Tis not loves going that hurts my days,
But that it went in little ways.

"There is nothing wrong with this, or with thinking about this; it doesnt reveal a superficiality or lack of substance, which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up. 
On the contrary, it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance, and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments, and how much can be delegated.
This should be something everyone can relate to, given the current craziness around dress codes in general, be it the complete nonsense of events that request creative dress or dress to impress or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing appropriately in an office setting, a word so vague that it is practically meaningless.

To a certain extent, we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction, as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work, putting an end to unspoken uniforms.

Early in the day, Mr. Trump broke his Twitter silence, posting, in quick succession, Good Morning, Have a Great Day! and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! which could be read as either expressions of hope or growing confidence.

"CHICAGO Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.
If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.
Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.
Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways.

"(CNN)As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.
It comes on the heels of the deadly storm system that plagued much of the Midwest, South and East over Christmas. 
The worst is over as that storm pushes offshore into the Atlantic. But it killed at least six people in the Midwest and South and brought blizzard conditions, a foot of snow, and winds exceeding 55 mph to the Great Plains and Upper Midwest on Thursday. It then ripped across the East with heavy rainfall and winds.
On Friday, more than 50 million people were under the threat of floods, with flood watches and warnings stretching from the Gulf Coast to New Jersey. 
Flash flooding affected Southern Mississippi and Alabama, triggering dangerous situations and high-water rescues. Up to a foot of rain fell in less than a day.
The rough weather made holiday travel even more of a headache. There were nearly 9,000 flight delays into, within or out of the country Friday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.
As of Saturday, flood watches have been largely discontinued, but there are still warnings for some rivers in the South, particularly across southern Mississippi and Alabama, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
""I'm not expecting the foot of rain some areas in the Southern US received,"" Cabrera said. ""An additional 1 to 3 inches may renew flooding concerns due to saturated soils. Some areas in the South will in fact make a run for wettest year on record with the last few storms filling rain gauges to record levels.""
Forecast radar images for Saturday show rain persisting in coastal areas of the Southeast, but it should clear out for inland cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.
The letup won't last long, however. On Sunday, moisture emanating from the Gulf of Mexico will bring a band of showers to southeastern Texas and then stretch across southern Louisiana, all the way up through the Carolinas.
Then, on the last day of 2018, another storm will bring rain, although less heavy, to the North and East, Cabrera said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Friday it will resume issuing new flood insurance policies during the partial U.S. government shutdown, reversing a decision announced two days ago. 
FEMA, which oversees the National Flood Insurance Program, said it was rescinding guidance issued on Wednesday that it would not be able to sell new policies during the shutdown unless Congress passes legislation reauthorizing the program. 
“As of this evening, all NFIP insurers have been directed to resume normal operations immediately and advised that the program will be considered operational since December 21, 2018, without interruption,” FEMA said on its website. 
The National Association of Realtors estimated the decision not to issue new policies could have disrupted up to 40,000 home sales each month. 
The flood insurance program insures about 5 million homes and businesses. 
The federal government has been partially shut down since Dec. 22 because of an impasse over President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion in taxpayer funding for a proposed border wall.

(CNN)Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.
Upstream from Scribner, Nebraska, on the Elkhorn River, a flood gauge measured its second highest crest: 17.65 feet. The flood gauge just downstream from the town stopped reporting on Wednesday when minor flooding was taking place; it could have been affected by ice floes.
The images show how the Elkhorn River temporarily made the town of Scribner an island. It appears, looking at satellite imagery, the only connection for the almost 900 residents of the town was Highway 275.
Normally, the Logan Creek Dredge, the river that flows into the Elkhorn River, is barely visible. It, too, far exceeds its usual banks.
Downstream in Waterloo, Nebraska, the Elkhorn River rose to 24.64 feet, the highest ever measured.
It beat the previous record, set in 1962, by more than 5 feet. The Platte River, to the left in the image, also was at historic levels farther upstream, in Leshara, Nebraska.
How much water was flowing in the Platte River is apparent by how far it exceeds its banks between North Bend and Fremont, Nebraska.
The 28,000 residents of Fremont were cut off during the height of the flooding. While no injuries were reported, authorities were conducting rescue missions across the city.
In Ashland, Nebraska, the Platte River also saw record levels of flooding. The river there 24.35 feet on Saturday was over a foot higher than ever recorded.
The river swelled so much there, it cut through swathes of farmland, turning the highest points into islands.
Offutt Air Force Base sits along the Missouri River just south of Omaha, Nebarska. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs Inc. shows much of the base sitting in Missouri River floodwaters.
Floodwaters made it into some 30 buildings on base and nine aircraft were evacuated because of the flooding, officials said. They included eight variations of a C135, and one E4B, an advanced airborne command post known as a ""doomsday plane.""
One of the most dramatic images shows the mouth of the Platte River where it meets the Missouri River near La Platte, Nebraska.
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Office said it's still not safe enough to allow residents of the Hanson and Chris Lakes area back into their homes.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission sought on Thursday to address suggestions in a Hungarian government information campaign that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and billionaire investor George Soros seek to flood the country with migrants. 
Initially dismissing the campaign launched throughout Hungary on Feb. 18 as a “ludicrous conspiracy theory”, the Commission published a report debunking the assertions on billboards and full-page newspaper ads. 
Relations between European Union institutions and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s nationalist Fidesz ruling party have soured since the 2015 migration crisis, when Orban closed Hungary’s borders to all incoming refugees and asylum seekers. 
Many of the ads feature text stating “You have the right to know what Brussels is planning”, over pictures of Juncker and Hungarian-born Soros. Orban accuses Soros of encouraging mass immigration into Europe, a charge the philanthropist denies. 
“Citizens do deserve to know the truth about what the EU is doing,” Commission officials said. “But we believe that they deserve fact not fiction.” 
The Commission report rejected Hungarian assertions that the European Union executive arm wanted to introduce refugee resettlement quotas, stating that refugee resettlement “is and will always be on a purely voluntary basis”. 
Orban was reelected for a third consecutive term last April on a strong anti-immigration platform, and his Fidesz party leads the polls ahead of May’s European parliamentary election. 
He has said he hopes anti-immigration parties will gain a majority, which he said could lead to changes in the EU executive. 
Continuing its take-down of the adverts, the Commission noted that job-training pilot programs for migrants were voluntary and Hungary had opted out of participating. 
“Member states remain exclusively in charge of the numbers of workers they admit, if at all,” the report said. 
The Commission also said that EU funding had nothing to do with a country’s stance on immigration, but that cohesion money would go to countries hit by migration to help them manage. 
Hungary is also under EU scrutiny for not observing the rule of law. In response to Orban’s ad campaign, Juncker also called for Fidesz’s exclusion from the European parliament’s biggest center-right political family EPP.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions have prevented the Iranian Red Crescent from obtaining any foreign financial aid to assist victims of flooding that has killed at least 70 people and inundated some 1,900 communities, the group said on Sunday. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Washington was ready to help via the Red Cross and Red Crescent, but accused Iran’s clerical establishment of “mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness”. 
“No foreign cash help has been given to the Iranian Red Crescent society. With attention to the inhuman American sanctions, there is no way to send this cash assistance,” the Red Crescent said in a statement. 
It said the group had received some non-financial help from abroad which had been distributed to flood victims. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said last week that U.S. sanctions - reimposed after Washington quit a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers - were impeding aid efforts to flood-stricken towns and villages. 
“Blocked equipment includes relief choppers: This isn’t just economic warfare; it’s economic TERRORISM,” he said on Twitter. 
The flood disaster, arising from exceptionally heavy rainfall since March 19, has left aid agencies struggling to cope and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters. 
The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. 
Iran’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved its oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad. 
Iran acted on Saturday to evacuate more towns and villages threatened by floods after continued rain in the southwest.

"Thelonious Monks 100th birthday in 2017 brought a flood of tributes, but the most monumental statement of devotion came a year late. Across six discs, the guitarist Miles Okazaki covers every known Monk composition, honoring the composers crooked style and getting his guitar to sound just as resonant and embodied as Monks piano did. Is it a brilliantly assembled suite of compositions for trio, or a loose, 30-minute improvisation? Either way, its low, dark and beautiful. And it feels like a guarantee that well be talking about the pianist Sam Harris for a long time. Three masters of improvising minimalism the drummer Andrew Cyrille, the trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith and the guitarist Bill Frisell convene for the first time.

 More than 420,000 people will work without pay, including nearly 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and 42,000 Coast Guard employees. As travelers flood the nations airports and train stations, 53,000 T.S.A. agents will keep working, as will air traffic controllers and aviation and railroad safety inspectors.
 Another 380,000 workers will be furloughed.
 The status of National Parks will be up in the air. Park staff would be furloughed, although the parks themselves would remain accessible. However, some parks, including the Grand Canyon, are planning to stay open.
 Visa and passport services will continue as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations, a department spokesman said, but passport agencies located in government buildings affected by a lapse in appropriations may become unavailable to the public.

"Im looking at global warming I dont need to see the graphs, said Hamburgs mayor, Cathy Crain, referring to the role of climate change in increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. After two record-setting floods in a single decade, Ms. Crain said, Im living it and everybody else here is living it.
The flood spoiled a time of cautious optimism in Hamburg, which like many rural Midwestern towns now has about half the population it once did. Next week, Dr. Wells, the school superintendent, was scheduled to ask state officials for permission to reopen the towns high school, a move seen as crucial to keeping young families in town. Before the water hit, Ms. Crain said, people were talking about building a new subdivision and finding new residents.
But as floodwaters receded in other places, Hamburg remained largely submerged on Wednesday. On the dry side of town, residents visited the school to pick up hot meals and donated clothes that filled the gym. Ms. Crain, who was operating from a makeshift City Hall in the schools home economics classroom, spoke hopefully about getting businesses back open, even as she coordinated more immediate concerns like hot showers and restoring gas service.
We had certainly our horrible moments were not through with that yet, Ms. Crain said. Today, were up and we are saying theres going to be a future.

"As the oceans continue to heat up, those effects will become more catastrophic. Coral reefs, whose fish provide key sources of protein to millions of people, will come under increasing stress; a fifth of them have already died in the last three years. Rainier, more powerful storms like Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricane Florence in 2018 will become more common, and coastlines around the world will flood more frequently.
Because they play such a critical role in global warming, oceans are one of the most important areas of research for climate scientists. Average ocean temperatures are also a consistent way to track the effects of greenhouse gas emissions because they are not influenced much by short-term weather patterns, Mr. Hausfather said.
Oceans are really the best thermometer we have for changes in the Earth, he said.
But, historically, understanding ocean temperatures has also been difficult. An authoritative United Nations report, issued in 2014 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, presented five different estimates of ocean heat, but they all showed less warming than the levels projected by computer climate models suggesting that either the ocean heat measurements or the climate models were inaccurate.
Since the early 2000s, scientists have measured ocean heat using a network of drifting floats called Argo, named after Jasons ship in Greek mythology. The floats measure the temperature and saltiness of the upper 6,500 feet of the ocean and upload the data via satellites.","An analysis concluded that Earth’s oceans are heating up 40 percent faster on average than a United Nations panel estimated five years ago, a finding with dire implications for climate change.",2019-01-10T19:13:01Z,"Ocean Warming Is Accelerating Faster Than Thought, New Research Finds",The New York Times,1
"The president has long insisted that there is a security and humanitarian crisis at the border with Mexico, an assertion that was undercut by Mr. Trump himself when he acknowledged that he could have waited to issue his declaration.

But others said they opposed the president on the grounds that it was the duty of Congress to appropriate taxpayer dollars and that Mr. Trump had exceeded his authority. On Thursday, a dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats in voting to overturn Mr. Trumps emergency declaration, in a 59-to-41 vote.

"In a separate interview, the Parks Department commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, said that unlike passive parks that double as floodplains, like those by Jamaica Bay, East River Park has structures, lights and synthetic turf, which does not do well in floods. And with the river projected to rise two and a half feet in 30 years, raising the park is the only way to save it.
By bringing in landfill and soil by barge, the new plan allows for daytime construction away from the highway, minimizing traffic disruptions. After its scheduled March 2020 launch, the new plan can thus be completed in three years rather than five, with flood protection in place by 2022.

 (CNN)The nation got its first chance to digest the details of the Green New Deal when Democrats proposed a nonbinding congressional resolution last week. Reading the 14-page document feels a bit like scanning a multipage menu in search of a satisfying meal. If you are a progressive, you feel overwhelmed by all there is to savor, and if you are a conservative, you struggle to find something you can stomach.
When New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the plan alongside Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, she offered it as a ""comprehensive agenda of economic, social, and racial justice in the United States of America."" Republicans didn't waste time sharing their distaste for the contents. A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee called the resolution ""zany"" and Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson pronounced it ""loony."" Pundits predicted that it will render Democrats unelectable. It's not hard to see why the proposed resolution sparked such divergent views. It is so sweeping in scope and so vague in detail that some claim it calls for the elimination of air travel and the end of cows. 
But putting aside the partisan sparring, the Green New Deal offers something every American should want: A country that is resilient to the impacts of climate change. In the proposed legislation, this takes the form of finding ways to pay for the resilience plans communities develop to prepare for worsening disasters, and repairing and upgrading our infrastructure to withstand future climate impacts, including increased flooding. 
The United States urgently needs to focus on resilience to climate impacts. Last week, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revealed that 2018 was the fourth warmest year on record. With more heat, the nation continues to see new extremes. A rain gauge in Hawaii measured the most rainfall in a single 24-hour period ever in the United States last year, while both West Virginia and North Carolina broke their precipitation records, with North Carolina exceeding 100 inches. And California lit up in flames driven by wildfires that caused unprecedented destruction. 
The losses from these and other climate and weather-related disasters in 2018 tallied to $91 billion. The overwhelming losses from climate-fueled disasters have the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan watchdog agency for the federal government, worried. It has deemed the fiscal drain caused by climate change a ""high risk"" and has wisely recommended that the nation increase its investment in resilience. 
Yet, despite the compelling need to build climate resilience, the nation hasn't even mastered the basics yet. We don't routinely incorporate climate resilience into our infrastructure planning. We do a lousy job of notifying people of their true flood risk, leaving communities to rely on flood maps that all too often ignore the increased risk of flooding from climate change. We spend our tax dollars to rebuild structures that probably won't withstand future climate impacts. We provide subsidized insurance to properties that flood over and over and over again. And we have almost no building codes that account for the future risk of climate change impacts. 
Our shortsighted approach means that when we invest in a new bridge or water treatment plant it is at risk of being washed away even before we hold the ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
What if we rose above the partisanship to embrace the Green New Deal's demand for climate resilience? We would unquestionably save money. 
Research tells us that by investing just $1 in resilience before calamity strikes, the nation can save itself $6 in future recovery costs. This preparedness would leave fewer people homeless, get children back to school faster, protect infrastructure investments, and let businesses reopen their doors more quickly. It would reduce demands for emergency services, allow authorities to restore order rapidly, and help keep the power on and the water running. And it can save lives. 
As the nation continues to study the Green New Deal and its menu of ideas, climate resilience is one aspect we should all agree upon -- no matter what our political persuasion.",The nation got its first chance to digest the details of the Green New Deal when Democrats proposed a nonbinding congressional resolution last week.

"(CNN)A pilot for 10 years, Adam Liston was at work, away from his small Nebraska community, when record flooding forced his wife and two kids to evacuate. When he got back, he knew what he had to do. 
""When I was able to return to Nebraska and saw the devastation, I just knew I had to help in the best way I could. And that was fly people in and out of the isolated town of Fremont,"" Liston, 29, of nearby Woodcliff, told CNN. ""I know how helpless I felt being away from my family during this, and I wanted to reunite as many people as I could.""
Liston is among an impromptu crew of private pilots who have offered free flights to residents stranded in Fremont. Deadly flooding in parts of Nebraska has turned whole communities into islands as the Platte and Elkhorn rivers swelled to record highs. 
Fremont's 28,000 residents were cut off at the height of the flooding. Flood records have been shattered in 17 places, and more rivers will likely break cresting records this week, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said.
Liston personally airlifted about 40 people thanks to a crowdfunding campaign launched with the help of his wife, Mandi, he said. 
""I started at 8 a.m. on Sunday, running purely on generous donations, but by noon, dozens more pilots and planes showed up, eager to help,"" he added. ""It was a full community effort."" 
More than 30 airplanes have flown into the Fremont Municipal Airport since the flooding began to help more than 500 flood victims, said Jim Kjeldgaard, owner and operator of Fremont Aviation. The pilots, who've come from across Nebraska and neighboring Kansas and Wyoming, are donating their time to help shuttle stranded residents to and from their hometowns. 
""We've had an awful lot of airplanes and a heck of a lot of people. It was pretty much chaos a few days ago; the situation is somewhat under control now, as some of the highways are opening back up,"" Kjeldgaard told CNN Tuesday morning.
""These people are taking days off of work to do this,"" he said. ""The general aviation people and some business aircraft have stepped right up to the plate. They took care of the situation the best it could be taken care of, considering.""
'Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride'
Another pilot, Adam Marshall, told CNN he heard about the airlifting effort from a guy he met just a couple of weeks ago. The man hangars his airplane in a building next to Marshall's. 
""He texted me and asked if I could help, and I thought it was a great opportunity to use my pilot skills for good,"" Marshall said. 
Marshall, who has been a private pilot for almost three years, said he made more than 30 trips between Fremont and Omaha's Millard neighborhood and transported about 40 people. His phone was ringing nonstop for two days from people asking to be transported, he said. 
""I transported the entire Midland University dance team to Omaha so they wouldn't miss their commercial flight and a woman named Allie who has five kids and had been cut off from her family,"" he said, noting that two of the children were 18-month-old twins. 
""I transported another woman whose husband had been airlifted to Omaha but she couldn't be with him because the roads were closed and there was no room in the helicopter,"" Marshall said. 
""Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride,"" he said. ""I got a lot of hugs the last few days!""
In Kjeldgaard's 48 years in the business, he's never seen a response quite like this, he said. 
""We've had flood situations here before but never this magnitude. We never needed this evacuation-type response. I've been here 48 years,"" he said. 
""That's the outpouring from general aviation pilots,"" he added. ""We're a close-knit community, even if we're a long ways away. You hate to see disasters like this happen, but the support was very nice to see.""

"One Defense Department official said the Pentagon was well aware that the militarys budget generally cannot be reprogrammed to pay for projects that Congress has not explicitly approved. But concerns remain that Mr. Trump will seek a creative workaround to the rules.
If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will build the remaining sections of the wall, Mr. Trump wrote on Dec. 11.
Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the likely next chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters this month that next years Democratic-led House will keep a close eye on moves by the White House to use American troops or Pentagon funding to build a border wall.
The president will send up his budget and well see, Mr. Smith told the Defense Writers Group. And if there is wall funding, well all flip out and say, We cant do that.
Relations have also deteriorated between the Defense Department, which was ordered to the border, and the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for policing it.
Pentagon officials have accused Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, of using the military as a shield against Mr. Trumps anger over the flood of migrants heading to the United States. That surge, in turn, has jeopardized his campaign promise of stopping illegal immigration.
Publicly, Mr. Mattis and other senior military leaders have refrained from criticizing the border mission. But privately, according to a senior official, they are furious over its impact on readiness and morale among soldiers who will be spending Christmas away from their families.","Units that have not been sent to the border must pick up the routine duties for those who have, and those that are deployed are not conducting the training needed to “fight tonight,” officials said.",2018-12-24T20:51:44Z,Impact of Border Deployments Is Felt by Troops at Home and Away,The New York Times,1
"This year, heat has been a problem in both northern and southern hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes dont have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 91 degrees, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940.
Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, we have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities.
Some preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought.
Dr. Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. Its why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we dont. We think well make it, because weve made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong.
In our DNA, weve got this extreme resilience baked in, Dr. Kolden said. That ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.

"In one way of looking at it, the bald eagles at Reelfoot Lake are returning the favor by providing a critical source of income for the region. Once a thriving community of farmers upward of 25,000 at midcentury, Mr. Douglas said it is now home to only 5,000 residents (and another 3,000 inmates at the Northwest Correctional Complex). The fertile land in the Mississippi flood plain is still farmed, but mechanization has replaced human labor. Across Lake County there are ghost churches at crossroads and the corners of fields; once the center of community life, theyve fallen into ruin, and the county has become one of the poorest in the United States.
Tourism is now its main source of income. Sportsmen keep the rental rooms filled during hunting and fishing seasons. Birders and naturalists arrive during the songbird migrations. And in winter eagle watchers show up from around the world to see a gorgeous bird, its talons extended, snatch a duck from a fallow rice field or sit quietly on a nest at the top of an immense cottonwood tree, its gleaming feathers rustling in the wind.
On our last morning at Reelfoot, our fellow guests at the Dragonfly Inn were speculating at breakfast about why so many people are fascinated by eagles. I think its because theyre so big, one woman said. So majestic. Another woman looked at a preacher who happened to be sitting at the head of the table. Its Isaiah, isnt it? she asked: But those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.

"Mr. Trump announced in a tweet on Sunday that Kevin McAleenan, 47, the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection, will be Ms. Nielsens replacement, as acting Homeland Security secretary at a time when the president has said that there is a security crisis at the border with Mexico because of a flood of migrants trying to gain entry into the United States.
Some acting officials like Mr. Shanahan, who had been deputy defense secretary, have been confirmed by the Senate but not in the post in which they currently serve. David Bernhardt, the acting Interior secretary, had already been confirmed as the departments deputy and is undergoing confirmation by the Senate for the top job.
Mr. Trump had long said he was satisfied with the performance of Ms. Nielsen. He expressed similar optimism for her acting successor.

The coalition is now preparing to tap its modest reserve fund, of just over $200,000, that was intended to cover unintended emergencies, like floods or the loss benefits by individual clients. It will be used to bridge the loss of federal cash to cover rent, the salaries of case managers who provide support to disabled and elderly clients, maintenance costs, and other expenses for the 250 households of formerly homeless people.

"SEATTLE Howard Schultz faced a full-court press of troubles as 2006 began. That the Seattle SuperSonics were lousy, having their worst season in 20 years, was only the beginning.
Though the Sonics were a storied N.B.A. franchise, with a league championship in 1979, attendance was down at their Seattle arena along with points scored and revenues earned. As the teams lead owner, Mr. Schultz was facing unrest from fans and partners alike. At the same time, Starbucks, the coffee company he had built into a global giant, was about to hit a bad patch, too, as the first ripples of the Great Recession began to rise into a flood tide.
You dont have to be a basketball fan to know which problem Mr. Schultz was able to fix.
The Sonics no longer exist sold by Mr. Schultzs group that same pivotal year, and later moved to Oklahoma City and renamed, even the memorabilia packed away. Now, as Mr. Schultz mulls running for president as an independent candidate, his path through that moment says a lot about him how he handles adversity and uncertainty, and how he grasped or did not the nettle of local politics as the Sonics were flailing, according to more than 20 people who have observed him, befriend him or worked with or against him over the years.
His basketball legacy has left many in Seattle outraged to this day, believing Mr. Schultz to be either duplicitous or duped by others.

"Mr. Corona maintained his innocence for years. Then, at a parole hearing on Dec. 5, 2011, he admitted his crimes, apparently for the first time in a public forum. (He was reported to have confessed before to a prison psychologist.)
Asked if he knew why he was in prison, Mr. Corona replied, Well, I commit all those those dead persons, 25.
When asked why he had killed them, he gave a rambling answer in which he called the victims winos and creeps who had been trespassing. It was the closest he ever came to saying why he did it. Prosecutors never offered a motive.
With a wife, Gloria, and four young daughters, Juan Vallejo Corona seemed an unlikely killer. But he had trouble in his past. A flood that killed dozens of people in Sutter County in late 1955 had apparently left him unhinged, convinced that the people around him were the ghosts of those who had drowned.
A half brother, Natividad Corona, committed him to a mental hospital in early 1956. He was released months later, after undergoing electroshock treatments for schizophrenia. For a time he seemed to have a stable life, working his way up from farm laborer to labor contractor. He went to church.
Yet he was known to be quick-tempered and a brooder. In March 1970 he began another monthslong stay in a mental hospital. The next year, with increasing mechanization hurting his business, he applied for welfare. When his application was denied, he flew into a rage, a welfare official recalled.

"(Reuters) - The floods that have devastated large swaths of Nebraska and Iowa since late last week left house pets homeless, inflicted an unknown toll on livestock and led to several daring water rescues of animals from dogs to horses. 
Rescuers in the Omaha area, where the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri rivers began spilling over their banks last week, have been working overtime to save dogs and cats along with their owners, sometimes at risk to themselves. 
“It becomes very difficult and it does put our rescuers in harms way, because you have animals that can potentially try to bite or fight,” Rescue Lieutenant Jami Mitchell of Waterloo Fire/Rescue in Nebraska said by phone on Tuesday. 
Along with the 189 adults and eight children pulled from flooded homes in Waterloo, about 20 miles west of Omaha, Mitchell tallied 87 dogs, eight cats, one rabbit, two birds, two hamsters and 26 horses. 
“We’ve had some families that have had up to six dogs that were loaded on an air boat at the same time as the families being evacuated from flood waters,” she said. 
The rain- and snow-melt-induced flooding in the middle of the country’s farm belt has killed at least four people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, killing untold numbers of livestock. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that the governors of Nebraska and Iowa told him that up to 1 million calves may have been killed. 
But Nebraska Agriculture Department Director Steve Wellman said there were no reliable numbers of animals lost to flooding. 
Ranchers, some of whom have used air boats to bring feed to flood-stranded herds, are bracing for the possibility of additional problems with their livestock once the waters recede, Nebraska Cattlemen spokeswoman Talia Goes said. 
“Standing in the cold water and being cold certainly isn’t good for the health of the animal,” she said by phone. 
Two Omaha area shelters for people evacuated from their homes are letting animal owners keep their pets during their stay, easing the strain on animal shelters and the stress on people forced to flee their homes. 
“It’s helped the folks staying here; they’ve been through enough,” said Josh Murray, spokesman for the Omaha/Council Bluffs Metro Region Office of the American Red Cross. 
Nebraska Humane Society Vice President Mark Langan said a dozen horses have been led out of raging flood waters along with dogs, cats and other pets that the agency is sheltering. 
“We are nearing capacity, but we always figure out a way to find room,” said Langan. 
In some cases, the flooding has uncovered animal hoarders, such as a house on the outskirts of Omaha where teams pulled out 75 cats and dogs, Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue President Terri Larson said. 
“Right now, we’re doing a water rescue for eight feral dogs and a couple of birds,” Larson said by phone. “It’s been crazy.”

"As climate change conditions continue to increase, new research put forth by geologists suggests that the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) could melt and cause a massive global flood.
The study, presented at the American Geophysical Union earlier this month, highlights the concerns and the risks involved if the sheet ─ which originally disappeared 125,000 years ago because of a changing climate ─ were to collapse.
""Ice-sheet models link Pine Island glacier absence to full WAIS collapse into ice caps on mountains,"" the study's abstract reads. ""Our record thus provides the first direct indication of a much smaller LIG WAIS, providing paleo-context for the susceptibility of the WAIS to collapse.""

Speaking with Science magazine, Boston College paleoclimatologist Jeremy Shakun said that it may not require much for the West Antarctic ice sheet to move, which could cause ocean levels to rise as much as 8 feet per century.
If the findings hold up, it would confirm “the West Antarctic Ice Sheet might not need a huge nudge to budge,” Shakun told the news outlet. That could suggest “the big uptick in mass loss observed there in the past decade or two is perhaps the start of that process rather than a short-term blip.”
The study's lead author, Oregon State glacial geologist Anders Carlson, said: “We had an absence of evidence. I think we have evidence of absence now.”
The Alfred-Wegener Institute suggests that the West Antarctic ice sheet is not terribly stable and cited a 2016 study that suggested it could disappear in as little as 1,000 years.
""Given a business-as-usual scenario of global warming, the collapse of the West Antarctic could proceed very rapidly and the West Antarctic ice masses could completely disappear within the next 1,000 years,"" says Johannes Sutter, the study's main author in comments on the Institute's website.
THIS COFFIN-SHAPED ICEBERG IS HEADED TO DIE
The ice sheet originally disappeared approximately 125,000 years ago, the study noted, and found that sea levels were more than 19 feet (6 meters) above present levels.
A study released in June notes that climate change has caused more than 3 trillion tons of ice to melt from Antarctica over the past 25 years ago, according to a USA Today report.
In September, NASA unveiled its new $1 billion satellite, ICESat-2, to give humanity a stronger, data-backed vision of exactly how fast Earth’s ice is melting.
According to the government space agency, melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has increased the global sea level more than a millimeter per year, which is a third of the overall increase.

"For decades, the Markey family had been part of the congregation at St. Marys Winfield, also known as Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians, a Catholic church in Woodside, Queens. Ms. Markey volunteered as a eucharistic minister. The elder Mr. Markey was a lector, reading passages from the Bible during Mass. Charles Markey, the oldest of the three children, attended the church school, just as his father had. He was also an altar server.
He said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a priest at the church when he was in the seventh and eighth grades; it started when he was around 12 years old.
For years, he told no one. Eventually, as an adult, he opened up to a girlfriend, who had told him her own story of assault. He was in his 30s, he said, when he sat his parents down, telling them in detail about what had happened. (A former prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter, said he recalled the allegation being brought to the Queens district attorneys office, and it being discussed.)
Youre a little kid, the younger Mr. Markey said, noting the abundance of fear and shame that had kept him from speaking up. You cant make those adult decisions. So much is taken away from you. Your self-esteem is destroyed. Your confidence is destroyed.
In a statement, the Diocese of Brooklyn, whose territory includes Queens, said Mr. Markey took part in its independent reconciliation and compensation program and his allegations were found to be credible. The diocese said he had not accepted a settlement offer. It also said that the family had been offered counseling in the past, but they did not accept.
The Diocese of Brooklyn takes all allegations of sexual abuse seriously, the statement said. We commend the new version of the legislation, recently signed into law, that now helps all victims-survivors. We hope it offers them a path to recourse and reconciliation.

"COLUMBUS, Neb./CHICAGO (Reuters) - Nebraska grain farmer Ryan Ueberrhein was barely breaking even after the U.S.-China trade war pushed prices for his soybean crop to a decade low. Then the nearby Elkhorn River burst its banks as flooding swept across the U.S. farm belt. 
Uberrhein’s farm was left covered in debris after the roiling water receded. He has mounting debts. And he is worried that President Donald Trump may not be able to strike a trade deal with China that would end tariffs on U.S. soybean exports - and allow him to sell whatever grain is left intact at a better price. 
Frustration is building across farm country at what feels like a never-ending season of bad news. 
The trade war “keeps damaging us,” said Ueberrhein, 34, of Valley, Nebraska, who voted for Trump. “What the president is doing, we stand by him, but ... we can’t keep getting hit just because a deal can’t be made quickly.” 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to arrive in China this week for another round of trade talks with their Chinese counterparts. The two sides have yet to agree on many core issues. 
Farmers who spoke to Reuters remained supportive of Trump. 
Soybean exports to China hit a four-year low in February because of the trade war. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, which are the largest single U.S. agricultural export. A near halt in exports has hit a rural economy already struggling after years of oversupply cut farm incomes by 50 percent in the past five years.

The Nebraska Rural Response Hotline, which provides support to farmers and ranchers, has received a record number of calls about financial distress, said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. Calls about suicide and depression were up, too, he said. 
The latest piece of bad news came on March 11, when the Trump administration released its 2020 budget and proposed a 15 percent cut for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, calling its subsidies to farmers “overly generous.” 
It did not matter to farmers, who helped vote Trump into office, that the budget will not pass muster with Democrats who control the House of Representatives, Hansen said. Some farmers took the proposed cut to subsidies for crop insurance as an insult. 
“How many times do you have to kick us when we’re down?” he said. 
That insurance is crucial to Richard Oswald, who farms near Phelps City, Missouri. The flood has already swallowed his childhood home, many of his fields and more than 20,000 bushels of corn. His four grain bins have burst, after water-logged corn expanded and split open. 
“If our government and leaders can’t step up and start to lead, we’re done for,” he said. 
For years, Oswald paid extra for flood insurance. He hoped that government talk of investing in improving U.S. infrastructure would come through - and bolster the levees and dams throughout the Midwest. 
But this year, as the trade war dragged on, he dropped the policy to reduce expenses. So he will get no insurance money for the lost corn, Oswald said. 
A few days ago, one of his lenders called. Oswald didn’t have to pay the loan right away, the lender said, but he would have to repay it sooner or later. 
“Help needs to come from Congress, but Congress is so divided, I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Oswald said. 
DISASTER DECLARATION 
Trump approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska on Thursday, making federal funding available in nine counties that bore the brunt of the recent floods. On Saturday, he approved one for flood-affected counties in Iowa. 
Greg Ibach, a USDA under secretary, is touring the damage in Nebraska, and Bill Northey, another under secretary, will head to Iowa, agency officials told Reuters. 
U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said the farm belt states would need more aid, suggesting a separate relief bill to offer compensation to farmers for livestock killed in the floods and grains in storage that will have to be destroyed. 
“The United States government has always been the insurance of last resort,” Grassley said in a phone interview on Friday. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts put agricultural flood damage for the state at nearly $1 billion. Iowa officials are projecting losses of at least $1.6 billion, with at least $214 million in damage to the agriculture sector. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said her state would need assistance beyond what is granted through disaster declarations. 
Farmers, meanwhile, are staring at waterlogged fields and expecting more floods. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the flooding would worsen in coming weeks as snow on the ground melts and water flows downstream. 
Iowa farmer Dave Newby said the standing water in his fields was already threatening his planned start to corn in mid-to-late April. Newby, like many farmers, had been looking to boost his corn plantings this year because such a large volume of soybeans had been left unsold because of the trade war. 
The same was the case in nearby Nebraska. Parts of flooded farmland remained under water and farmers had yet to assess the damage the piled-up sand, silt and debris caused to soil. Almost all said planting will likely be delayed, which could lead to lower yields. 
 “Normal planting would take place around May 1, but I doubt we will make it,” said Kendal Sock, a cattle and corn farmer in Genoa. “I wish they’d get this trade deal done, like now.”

"(Reuters) - Large parts of Nebraska and the U.S. Central Plains were underwater on Saturday after a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm triggered historic flooding along the Missouri and Platte rivers, causing two deaths, tearing apart homes and swallowing roadways. 
The National Weather Service predicted dangerous flooding would continue through the weekend in Nebraska and in south and west central Iowa, particularly along the Missouri River. 
“We’re still in a very widely dispersed and intense flooding situation in the eastern third of Nebraska,” said Mike Wight, a spokesman for the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a phone interview. 
Nebraska has had two flood-related fatalities this week, Wight said. One person died at home after failing to evacuate, although the exact cause of death was unclear, authorities said, and the other was swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
The Missouri River was still rising on Saturday evening, local TV station KMTV reported, with a record crest of more than 47 feet expected early on Tuesday in Brownville, Nebraska, about 70 miles south of Omaha in the eastern corner of the state. 
“We’re looking at 4, 5, 6, 7 feet above the highest it’s ever been,” Wight said. 
The flooding came in the wake of what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm blew from the western Rockies to the Central Plains last week. 
The rising water has reduced stores and homes to rubble and ripped off a long chunk of a highway bridge, according to photos posted on Twitter by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Ranchers posted images on social media of their cattle being dug out of snowdrifts or stranded in fields. 
The flooding has all but blocked access to some small communities along the river, where potable drinking water has become scarce as the flood has contaminated wells, Wight said. 
Ricketts visited several flooded communities on Saturday and wrote on Twitter that he witnessed “unbelievable devastation.”

"On Jan. 1, the new minimum wage, set at $15 an hour, went into effect in New York City, and most companies employing more than 10 people have to pay it. The increase, considered a crucial step in the fight against poverty, is the result of a hard-fought grass-roots organizing effort begun seven years ago and championed as a great victory by liberal politicians, even those who were initially not liberal enough to embrace it. But how much will the new standard do to alleviate some of the most punishing aspects of the citys affordability crisis?
Last year, San Francisco and Seattle enacted a $15 minimum wage. Though both cities are also fantastically expensive, it is too soon to to draw any comparison to New York, which presents its own challenges. (What we do know from a study examining the experiment in Seattle is that as wages increased on the path to $15 an hour, experienced workers benefited most from higher pay at the expense of reduced opportunities for workers with less experience.)
Buried under the relentless flood of news during the last months of 2018 was a report, sponsored in part by City Harvest, New Yorks largest supplier of food to pantries and hunger charities that suggested less-than-optimistic predictions for what a new wage standard might achieve. The authors of the report calculated a self-sufficiency standard, meant to determine how much income is now required to meet basic needs housing, child care, food, transportation, health care without help from public subsidies, for families of different sizes living in different parts of the city.
The study found that more than two in five households in New York City lacked the income to cover necessities. And yet just a third of those households were considered poor by measures used by the federal government measures typically used as qualifiers for certain kinds of public assistance and ones that do not account for family composition among many other variables.
You begin to understand some of the animosity directed at Amazon around its impending move to Queens, for example, when you see how much money is actually required to live there already, before housing prices are destined to be driven up even further by the companys expansion. A single parent with two-school age children, for example would need to make nearly $69,427 a year, according to City Harvests Self-Sufficiency calculator. That amounts to an hourly wage of just under $33.",How much the new salary standard can change the fortunes of workers in one of the most expensive cities on earth is now the million dollar question.,2019-01-04T12:00:01Z,"Big City: The $15 Minimum Wage Is Here.

"While charges are pending, they may lose their jobs, disrupt their child care or risk their immigration status. Even when cases are dismissed, as about one-third of misdemeanor charges eventually are, defendants must still resist pressures to plead guilty, for weeks or even months.
If cases are not dismissed, well over 90 percent of defendants will plead guilty. They will then struggle with fines, probation, perhaps jail, and permanent criminal records that can derail their future employment, housing and education. It turns out that simply being arrested and charged with a minor offense is a long and painful step toward being convicted of one.
Those initial police decisions are crucial in another way: Arrests determine who will end up in the misdemeanor pipeline. African-Americans make up nearly 30 percent of national misdemeanor arrests although they represent some 12 percent of the population. Marijuana arrests are especially skewed by race; blacks are four times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession, even though the two groups use marijuana at the same rates. In many cities, people of color are disproportionately arrested for jaywalking, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. These racially skewed policing decisions begin an official process that formally criminalizes millions of people of color every year.
That enormous misdemeanor process constitutes the bulk of the American criminal system. Thirteen million misdemeanor cases are filed annually thats 80 percent of all state criminal dockets. This is how our criminal system works most of the time, for the most people.
There are many ways that the police and prosecutors can improve the misdemeanor system, mostly by shrinking it. The police can deploy low level arrests less often and in more targeted and strategic ways, as many community policing programs already do. And they can focus on reducing racial disparities. 
Prosecutors should devote more time and resources to screening misdemeanors so that minor arrests do not become criminal charges so easily and so often. The ultimate aim and the thing voters should demand in the next election is to ease the flood of misdemeanor arrests and convictions that quietly derails millions of peoples lives every year, and that exacerbates some of the worst injustices of our criminal system.

"Even as floodwaters receded in hard-hit places in in the Midwest, experts warned Saturday that with plenty of snow still left to melt in northern states, the relief may only be temporary.
Rainfall and some snowmelt spurred flooding in recent weeks that's blamed in three deaths so far, with two men in Nebraska missing for more than a week. Thousands were forced from their homes in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, as water broke through or poured over levees in the region. The damage is estimated at $3 billion, and that figure is expected to rise.
As temperatures start to warm, snowmelt in the Dakotas and Minnesota will escalate, sending more water down the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and their tributaries.
Lt. Col. James Startzell, deputy commander of the Corps of Engineers' Omaha, Nebraska, district, said even warmer temperatures are possible into next week. He urged those living near rivers to keep a wary eye on them.
Bill Brinton, emergency management director for hard-hit Buchanan County, Missouri, which includes St. Joseph's 76,000 residents, said he expects more flooding this spring. Buchanan and its neighboring counties have been ravaged by this round of flooding.
""There's a sense from the National Weather Service that we should expect it to continue to happen into May,"" Brinton said. ""With our levee breaches in Atchison and Holt and Buchanan counties, it's kind of scary really.""
A precautionary evacuation involving hundreds of homes in the St. Joseph area was lifted as the Missouri River began a swift decline after coming just inches short of the 1993 record. St. Joseph was largely spared, but Brinton said 250 homes were flooded in the southern part of Buchanan County. It wasn't clear when residents would be able to get back.
When they do, officials say they need to be careful. Contaminants that escaped from flooded farm fields, industrial operations and sewage plants are part of the murky water now saturating homes.
In Fremont County, Iowa, homes remain underwater, so it will be some time before residents can return, said county Supervisor Randy Hickey.
""We don't want them in that water, anyway,"" Hickey said.
The water itself isn't the only concern. Experts warn that sharp objects broken glass, pieces of metal, pointy sticks and rocks could lurk in muddy debris. Downed or broken power lines also may pose electrocution hazards.
Another risk is posed by river wildlife. Brinton said two people in Buchanan County were bitten by snakes after returning home following flooding in 2011.
The Missouri River had yet to crest further downstream in Missouri, and while flooding impact in those areas was expected to be far less severe, there was some concern about drinking water in Kansas City, Missouri.
The utility KC Water said the flood resulted in the failure to meet standards for the treatment of the parasite cryptosporidium. KC Water says the concern isn't enough to issue a boil order, but people with extreme health conditions were advised as a precaution.
Concern was rising on the Mississippi River, too. Major flooding was reported at several spots north of the Iowa-Missouri line. St. Louis and other Missouri cities were seeing mostly moderate flooding.
Even the lower Mississippi River was impacted. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday rescued two boaters from a disabled vessel near New Orleans. Coast Guard officials said the flooding means more debris in the river, and the currents can pull a boat into danger.","With plenty of snow still left to melt to the north, the threat isn't over.",2019-03-23T18:15:14Z,Experts warn Midwest flood risk may persist for months,ABC News,1
"That is the real context for this immigration crisis. Whats the answer? Well, if you look at what slowed the flood of single Mexican men illegally and legally coming to America in the last decade, it was the combination of greater economic opportunity in Mexico, thanks in part to Nafta, plus slower population growth in Mexico, plus improved governance in Mexico, plus better border security along the Mexico-U.S. border.
That same formula has to be applied now to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have become the primary source of all those migrants and caravans coming to America today, including 187,000 minors without adult guardians, who were picked up by the U.S. Border Patrol between 2014 and 2018. Their parents sent them our way to connect with relatives already here or to be shielded from forced gang recruitment and violence.
A report last June by the Council on Foreign Relations noted, In 2015, the latest year for which data is available, as many as 3.4 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras were living in the United States, more than double the estimated 1.5 million people in 2000. Because of rampant corruption and gang warfare, Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans each year pay an estimated total of $651 million in extortion to organized crime groups. These gangs, like MS-13, exploded in Central America in the mid-1990s following large-scale deportations from the United States of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.
Thats why, among other things, a smart U.S. immigration policy would promote family planning in rural areas in Central America. Letting Americas religious right limit U.S. family planning assistance abroad is stupid. 
The only thing more stupid is not working to mitigate climate change, which Trump refuses to do. Extreme weather has been disrupting small-scale farming in Central America. And when small-scale farming weakens or collapses, people leave the countryside and flock to the city. And if they find high unemployment and high crime rates there, they head to America.
At the same time, we need an investment shock by local and foreign companies and governments to build infrastructure, tourism and trade in Central America so more people can thrive there, especially when 61 percent of the population is under 29 years of age.
Alas, though, investment rates average just 12 percent of G.D.P. in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, while in Mexico its 26 percent.","A migrant from Honduras in southern Mexico, on his way to the United States border.",2019-02-06T00:25:37Z,What if Trump Could Explain as Well as He Inflames?,The New York Times,0
"Thats Alex Joness M.O., Owens said of the deposition. To flood any topic with confusion and doubt so no one can grab onto anything.
But under oath, Mr. Joness tactics fissile. And the deposition highlights a troubling reality: The legal system may be the only way to defang a well-known conspiracy theorist at the height of his powers. Not only does the parade of lawsuits related to the Sandy Hook shooting cast him as a villain, but they threaten to expose and, perhaps drain, the funding sources that keep Infowars running without advertisers. Theres plenty at stake; documents reviewed by The New York Times last September suggest the bulk of Mr. Joness money comes from his business selling supplement products, allegedly netting more than $20 million in revenue per year.
Near the end of the questioning, Mr. Jones suggested his claims about the Sandy Hook massacre were the result of a mental disorder. He said he almost had like a form of psychosis back in the past where I basically thought everything was staged, even though Im now learning a lot of times things arent staged. 
The deposition footage is a rare occasion where Mr. Joness anger is caged. But I saw it once before, while covering his child custody trial in 2017, where he claimed that his Infowars persona was performance art. Throughout the trial, Mr. Jones, frustrated at being legally compelled to stay quiet, was restless and irritable. On the stand, he couldnt maintain his composure. His behavior pretending to lack specific knowledge, wagging his finger at opposing counsel and refusing to answer yes or no questions was far more reminiscent of a spoiled child than a multimillionaire media tycoon.
Its unsurprising that the opposing legal team chose to release the deposition footage online, where it received tens of thousands of views in just 24 hours. In the sea of viral clips of Alex Jones, he always appears larger than life and, crucially, in tenuous control of whatever narrative hes spinning. That control is largely the source of his power over his audience, his employees and his critics. 
But this new set of viral clips busts the myth of Alex Jones, presenting him in a situation he can neither engineer nor spin. Hes a man who has lost control of the narrative. And its this performance more than any ruling from any judge that poses the greatest threat to the Infowars empire.","Shock jocks lose their power when forced to tell the truth, the whole truth.",2019-03-31T10:20:55Z,Why Courtrooms Are Kryptonite for Alex Jones,The New York Times,0
"This means that electric utilities, in particular, and other businesses more generally have to rethink how they prepare for dangerous fire conditions and other impacts of climate change. These impacts are only growing. The thousand-year flood is now a regular event. The future will also bring further sea level rise, stronger hurricanes, storm surges, droughts, heat waves and wildfires beyond historical precedent. PG&amp;E has noted that more than half of the companys vast service area of 70,000 square miles is now considered to be in extreme or high fire-risk areas. No doubt much of the considerable cost of girding against these conditions will fall on rate payers.
So what should electric utilities threatened by the potential for wildfires do? It may require better protecting grid infrastructure and being more prepared to shut off power when wildfire risk is especially high. Homeowners and businesses must be prepared when the grid is turned off and will require backup sources of electricity for critical needs.
But utilities arent alone in facing climate threats. For transportation companies, for example, it may require hardening infrastructure like port facilities or rail lines to protect them from floods or fires. Fossil fuel companies may be forced to deal with stranded assets like oil fields and coal seams that have been bought but wont be developed as society moves away from coal and oil. For others, like insurance companies, it may provide business opportunities. And for many entrepreneurs it may lead to completely new products and services.
Risk managers at these companies will need to consider scenarios that have never happened before. Investors will need to assess the climate risks embedded in their portfolios and must demand greater transparency from the managers of the companies that they own.
However, for society at large, and the government in particular, the most important and urgent action required is to minimize future warming by creating appropriate global incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Economists generally agree that rather than regulate behavior, it is more effective to allow individuals to choose their actions, as long as the prices appropriately reflect the costs, including the risks posed by climate change.",A firefighter checked out burned vehicles and a fallen power line after the Camp Fire in California in November.,2019-01-29T19:09:38Z,The Very High Costs of Climate Risk,The New York Times,0
"(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Where it happens, dangerous travel conditions and power outages are possible. Winter storm watches and advisories already are in place for more than 12 million people in portions of states from New Mexico to North Carolina. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: Friday morning through Saturday evening Precipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Snow, ice and f looding rain Snowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Nearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots. Oklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most Arkansans won't feel precipitation until later Friday, with winter weather beginning in the overnight hours and moving east Saturday morning toward Tennessee. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix Significant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a ""once-in-a-generation event."" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow. While most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon. Snow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" or ""the wedge"" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a ""warm nose"" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the ""'wedge,"" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85.

"(CNN)Changing to a new antidepressant caused Ariel Winter to lose weight, the ""Modern Family"" actress said. 
It was several things Winter touched on on Tuesday during an Instagram Stories question-and-answer session.
""The change in medication instantly made me drop all of the weight I couldn't lose before by just giving me back a metabolism,"" Winter wrote in response to a submitted question. ""That was very unexpected.""
Winter, 21, said she had been on antidepressants for years and had learned to accept the weight gain that was a side effect of the medication. But she grew tired of the ""eh"" feeling associated with the drug, which she didn't name, so she started the search for something new.
""So I started the process again and was able to find a great combination of medication that works for me,"" she wrote.
Winter also answered questions about her mental health, saying that she was ""doing pretty good"" and that seeing a therapist was nothing to be ashamed of.
""I'm hoping the discussions will keep us progressing in the right direction with mental health check ups,"" she said.
She also raved about getting breast reduction surgery, giving it a 10 out of 10 recommendation and saying it feels nice now that her back doesn't hurt any more.
For years Winter has battled body shaming internet trolls. In 2015, she posted a swimsuit photo with two of her nieces that triggered a flood of lewd and disparaging comments.
Her response to that included a photo of the back of a woman's legs marked with labels about the meaning some people are inclined to read into the length of a woman's hem.
""The height of a girl's skirt or whatever she is wearing for that matter, does not imply what she is asking for. It sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I'm 'asking for it,' "" Winter wrote.
Overall, Winter sounded pleased with how things turned out after switching medications, but there is one thing she misses.
""While I feel better mentally with the change, and it's nice to work out and have your body actually respond, but I want to gain a few pounds of muscle and get healthier,"" she wrote. ""Also want my butt back.""

"In 2010, as minority leader, Mr. McConnell stated that his main goal was not to help our country recover from the Great Recession but to make President Obama a one-term president. A self-declared proud guardian of gridlock, he presided over an enormous escalation in the use of the filibuster. His innovation was to transform it from a procedural tool used to block bills into a weapon of nullification, deploying it against even routine Senate business to gridlock the legislative process.
The two forces that characterized Mr. McConnells career, obstruction and increasing the power of corporate money in our democracy, have worked hand in hand to diminish the Senate and paralyze American politics. The flood of outside money incentivized obstruction over cooperation, and a new generation of Republicans embraced Mr. McConnells obstructionist tactics. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, owes his standing to a few filibusters and a super PAC: As a freshman senator, he used Mr. McConnells tactics to shut down the government in 2013 and parlayed the resulting attention and fund-raising to run for president (and lose to Mr. Trump).
Republicans actually took the Senate majority in 2014 in large part on claims to restore the Senate. Unsurprisingly, they broke their promises. Under President Trump, Mr. McConnell continued to run roughshod over Senate traditions, jamming the $1.5 trillion tax bill through without so much as a proper hearing. The one place the Senate has functioned efficiently is in judicial confirmations, but even here Mr. McConnell has cast aside bipartisan norms and reduced the Senate to a rubber stamp for some unqualified, extremist judges, including those rated unqualified by the American Bar Association.
Mr. McConnell is not playing three-dimensional chess. There is no grand strategy or long game there is only what best serves his narrow interest. And since 2010, Mr. McConnell has been convinced that his interests are best served through strict obedience to the Republican base. That year, his handpicked candidate, Trey Grayson, lost a Senate Republican primary in Kentucky to an insurgent named Rand Paul. It was a humiliating defeat and called into question Mr. McConnells power in his own backyard. It also invited a Tea Party challenge against his re-election in 2014.
Since that scare, Mr. McConnell has rigidly adhered to whatever the base wants, institutions be damned. When the base wanted Judge Merrick Garland blocked, he obeyed. When the base wanted Mr. Trump embraced, he obeyed. While Paul Ryan was playing Hamlet in the summer of 2016, Mr. McConnell quickly endorsed Mr. Trump, providing institutional cover and repeatedly assuring Republicans that Trump would be fine. Mr. McConnell didnt think Trump was going to win he has said so himself  but he probably figured that the damage could be contained.",He’s not an institutionalist.

"(CNN)After a gunman killed 17 people on the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the letters from strangers across the world arrived in bulk, touching the survivors of the mass shooting. 
We love you, people wrote to the students in Parkland, Florida. We care about you. You will bounce back from this.
The letters helped the students heal. Now, they want to help families of victims of last week's shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, cope by writing letters to them and community residents.
The letter writing campaign began Wednesday. It will involve the student body and, possibly, South Florida Muslims, Koerber said.
The Parkland students grew connected to the Christchurch community they visited New Zealand last July on a learning and healing trip.
They planted trees in memory of their classmates who were killed on Valentine's Day 2018 and met with members of the Student Volunteer Army -- a movement that started afer an earthquake in Christchurch in 2011 -- about sustaining their own youth movement that grew out of the shooting on the Parkland campus. 
""We got letters after our tragedy, that was something that really surprised us,"" said Kai Koerber, a Stoneman Douglas senior who visited Christchurch last year. ""It's something that really warmed the hearts of people in my community. I think it will warm the hearts of people in Christchurch as well.""
'Parkland stands with you'
According to law enforcement, a self-avowed white supremacist killed 50 people at Al Noor and Lindwood mosques in Christchurch on Friday. 
Koerber learned about the shootings from a friend in a New Zealand. He learned another friend from the volunteer army knew one of the victims in the killings. 
The senior shared the news in a group chat with fellow students who were on the trip, and they began discussing ways to help the Christchurch community.
""I'm really upset that they have to know firsthand what's it's like to have people senselessly gun down in their country,"" Koerber said. ""I'm really upset that the proliferation of white supremacist-based violence has reached a place that I thought was almost untouchable as far as gun violence is concerned.""
In the letters to the people he met in Christchurch, Koerber said, he will write in ""big, voluminous detail about how that I care about that them, and how much I know they're going to bounce back because I know who they are.""
In his letters to strangers, he'll tell them: ""Parkland stands with you. We have been there.""
Unfamiliar with gun violence
The students from Parkland quickly realized how unfamiliar their New Zealand counterparts were with gun violence. 
According to figures from the University of Sydney, New Zealand had 0.17 gun-related homicides per 100,000 people in 2015. In contrast, the United States had 11 deaths per 100,000 people that year, according to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
""For a lot of us, we were very surprised at how that dichotomous that relationship was in that respect,"" Koerber said. 
Emily Wolfman, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, recalled how one student in New Zealand who attended a panel discussion with students from Parkland struggled to understand what they were going through. 
""The student was genuinely apologizing to us because he didn't know how to empathize with us,"" Emilysaid.
The 17-year-old said she understood the difficultly the student was having relating to the gun violence. 
""It's hard. No one tells you how to deal with something like this,"" she said.
Until Friday's shooting, the deadliest massacre in the country's history happened 30 years ago when a man killed 13 people. 
Immediately after the recent shootings, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern vowed to reform the country's gun laws.
Koerber said he believes it is easier for a smaller country like New Zealand to come to quick solutions.
""The stagnation of the American legislative process and political process is due to the absolute magnitude and size of our country,"" he said, regarding gun control. 
He added: ""Gun violence is this country is being overseen by companies that are not thinking morally, but thinking fiscally."" 
Since the shooting, Parkland students have made it their mission to advocate for gun control. They adopted the rallying cry ""#NeverAgain, and a nascent movement was born.
Theyhave lobbied Florida lawmakers and led a historic march for gun control, what they called a ""March for Our Lives."" 
Weeks after the 2011 earthquake, the SVA was moved to similar action. 
The club says it dispatched more than 13,000 volunteers to help with cleanup after the quake. Over time, the organization has moved from largely disaster response to community engagement. Students who were children during the earthquake now run the club. 
The group is also behind a larger initiative to get New Zealanders to do community service around Anzac Day, the country's memorial day for veterans, the group said. 
Josh Blackmore, president of SVA, told Morning Report that sustaining the momentum over time is a challenge.
""It's always incredible for us to talk to other student movements that have been born from tragedy in other places of the world,"" he said before the Parkland students visited.
Koerber said he and other students wanted to ""figure out how we can get people to be consistently enthused in our cause."" They compared notes, and discovered they needed to be organized and have the passion to sustain a movement. 
""Being that their problem was the earthquake and ours we gun violence, we found a common ground,"" he said. ""Either way, it still affected people in negative way."" 
The groups created a guide for starting and sustaining a youth movement.
A flood of emotions again
For Emily,the shootings in Christchurch triggered a flood of memories. 
""Everyone was really emotional. It was really hard because we all thought we had healed,"" she said of fellow students, including those who went to New Zealand.
For the first time in about a month, she was emotional again.
 After the shooting, she sensed the mood was different when she walked in to the class of one of the chaperones of the New Zealand trip.
""You could just tell how upset and distraught how everyone was by it,"" she said.
""We went to New Zealand in order to look at a completely different culture,"" Emily said. ""And, suddenly, that culture is the same thing as ours.""

"We have also learned that there is strength in numbers. Miami can access a wealth of resources, including sea level rise projections, thanks to its membership in regional bodies like the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. The city has also gained a broader perspective on urban resilience challenges and approaches by joining global networks such as the Global Commission on Climate Adaptation, where we both serve as board members, and 100 Resilient Cities. 
Finally, we have learned that effective adaptation is a collective endeavor. It requires a holistic, long-term approach that takes into account the needs of our citizens today and in the future. This requires robust and meticulous long-term planning, informed investment in resilient infrastructure, adapting land use and building policies to address the climate challenge, advancing new transportation solutions, educating and informing citizens about climate change, training and mobilizing volunteers during emergencies, informing private property owners of climate risks, and forging partnerships with research institutions and business innovators. As this long list makes clear, there isnt a single aspect of our daily lives that isnt affected by climate change.
Perhaps one of the reasons there is so little investment in adaptation is the lack of financial incentives. Unlike a wind farm, for example, that can earn a steady return for investors, the monetary benefits of adaptation are less straightforward. Investing in resilience protects businesses and communities from devastating losses, so it must be measured in the lives saved and businesses that remain open. We are only now learning how to quantify these benefits to communities. Floridas Division of Emergency Management, for example, calculated that projects to reduce wind and water damage avoided $81 million in losses when Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016, while costing only $19 million to carry out. The projects included raising buildings, improving drainage, and buying and demolishing properties in vulnerable areas
That is why leadership, particularly from city governments like Miamis, is so important in driving investment in adaptation. After Hurricane Irma in September 2017 one of the costliest in United States history, leaving a $50 billion trail of destruction there was both a moral and a fiscal obligation to act. Thats why two months later, Miami voters approved the $400 million Miami Forever Bond.
The program is the citys answer to the shortfall of investment in adaptation. It brings together city planners, private sector innovators and citizens to build a stronger, more resilient future for Miami. Almost half this amount is being invested in flood defenses and other measures to combat the effects of rising sea levels. The remaining funds will be invested in affordable housing, tree planting, road work and an innovative approach to urban landscape design that will allow residents to continue enjoying waterfront access while improving drainage and sea wall defenses.","In 2017, voters agreed to finance adaptation efforts through property taxes. Now the first phase of those projects is underway.",2019-02-20T20:50:36Z,Miami Battles Rising Seas,The New York Times,0
"Since 1991, a structure built in the wildland-urban interface has to be made up of noncombustible materials, noncombustible roof, closed eaves, said Jonathan Cox, a division chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The regulations are on top of any local requirements. But those rules dont apply to buildings constructed before 1991. According to Zillow, the average home in California was built in the 1950s. What we dont have is retrofit programs, said Max Moritz, a cooperative extension specialist in wildfire at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. We retrofit for earthquake safety. And theres public funding for mitigating flood exposure. But we dont do that for fire. There have been efforts in recent years to create fire-adapted communities that are better situated to handle fires. We know these lands are dangerous, Chief Cox said.

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. A major storm in the southern U.S. dumped significant amounts of rain in Texas on Friday night into early Saturday morning. Areas near Houston reported rainfall rates overnight of up to 2 inches per hour as bands of thunderstorms moved through. Bunker Hill Village in Harris County received 7.88 inches of rain over past 24 hours, while Lake Jackson saw 7.72 inches and College Station received 3.98 inches. The radar on Saturday morning shows the storm is primarily a rain-producing system, with the heaviest bands producing downpours east of Houston. Heavy rain is falling in the South on Saturday morning with snow in northwestern Texas. When all is said and done in Texas and the Gulf Coast, widespread rainfall totals are expected to amount to 3 to 6 inches. As a result, the risk of flooding is extremely significant. Flash flood watches and flood watches are in effect from eastern Texas to Georgia on Saturday. Winter weather alerts and flood watches are in place due to the storm system moving through the South and Southeast over the weekend. On the northern edge of the system, there is snow and ice occurring with this storm. Already 3.25 inches of snow has been reported in Lubbock, Texas. Snow and a wintry mix are beginning to spread from the Texas Panhandle to northern Arkansas Saturday morning. Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings are in effect from New Mexico to Virginia. The storm system will track to the east-northeast Saturday afternoon into evening. During this time, cold air from the north will be wrapped into the system, which will set the stage for moderate to heavy snowfall in the Piedmont region and North Carolina. Very heavy snow is expected to fall in southwest Virginia and North Carolina on Sunday. The storm will move in the Southeast on Sunday morning and deliver heavy snow to western North Carolina. Further south, torrential rain will dominate, setting the stage for flooding in Georgia. Upwards of 6 inches of rain is expected in the Southeast once the storm has moved through by Monday. The National Weather Service has already issued flood watches for much of northern Georgia. Winter storm watches and warnings are in effect in the Southeast as well. The system will be offshore by noon on Monday, but it still will be producing rain and snow from Virginia to Tennessee and Alabama.

"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Armed police patrolled the streets and manned checkpoints; shops and restaurants stayed shuttered, and residents laid tributes as Strasbourg recoiled on Wednesday from the deadly shooting at a Christmas market. Blood stains spattered the Rue Des Grandes Arcades, a shopping street where some of the victims were shot. In Place Kleber, at the center of the French city, well-wishers left flowers at the foot of a Christmas tree, in memory of the two people killed. “It’s destroyed the Christmas market. Nobody will want to come here,” said Bui, a 46-year-old waiter at the Casa Toscana restaurant. “We thought it was firecrackers or a joke to begin with, what with the yellow vest protests at the moment,” he said, referring to nationwide demonstrations against high living costs. “It took about five minutes for people to realize what was going on.” The attack risks dealing a devastating blow to the city’s retail and tourism industries, just as the month-long yellow vest unrest may have blunted the French economy. The Saint Sepulcre restaurant, close to where the first shots were fired, was closed by manager Claude Fricker on Wednesday as two of her chefs who helped the wounded recovered from the trauma. “We know that we’re not safe anywhere despite all the security measures,” said a local pensioner who gave his name as Ralph. “It’s impossible to counter the actions of a madman, we should not give into panic or to paranoia.” First signs, though, were that visitors felt differently. At the Hotel Kleber on the main square, staff handled a flood of cancellations ahead of what should be one of the busiest shopping weekends before Christmas. “We’re getting a lot of calls and emails for cancellations. It’s going to hit us hard, said receptionist Elena Bonal. Mayor Roland Ries told reporters the city would not be cowed by what he said was indisputably an act of terror. “Life must resume tomorrow.

"BEIRA, Mozambique (Reuters) - The situation in the port city of Beira in Mozambique was “boiling” as residents suffered shortages of food, water and other essentials one week after a devastating cyclone, the head of a South African rescue operation said on Friday. 
Cyclone Idai battered Beira, a low-lying city of 500,000 residents, with strong winds and torrential rains last week, before moving inland to neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi. 
In Mozambique, 242 were killed in the storm and resulting floods, according to the official death toll, although this is expected to rise. In Malawi, around 56 were killed while Zimbabwe has recorded 142 deaths. 
Around 15,000 people were still missing in Mozambique, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said late on Thursday. The government is expected to give a briefing on Friday morning to update the number of people missing and dead. 
Briefing his team late on Thursday night, Connor Hartnady, rescue operations task force leader for Rescue South Africa, said Beira residents were becoming fed up with shortages. 
“There have been three security incidents today, all food related,” he told his team, without giving further details. 
Cartnady also said a group of 60 people had been discovered trapped by flood water in an area north of Beira during a reconnaissance flight. Rescue teams and the government were deciding how best to help them, he said, either by airlifting them to safety or dropping supplies. 
The storm’s torrential rains caused the Buzi and Pungwe rivers, whose mouths are in the Beira area, to burst their banks. 
Roads into Beira were cut off by the storm, and most of the city remains without power. The Red Cross has estimated 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed in the storm. 
Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Information said at least 30 students, two headmasters and a teacher from three schools were missing in the eastern region of the country. 
In the capital Harare there were shortages of diesel, leading to long queues following reports earlier this week that a control room for the pipeline in Beira that transports fuel to Zimbabwe had been damaged.

"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Frigid floodwaters pushing down the Missouri River left ruins, death and drowned livestock in their wake across the U.S. Midwest’s farmland, and were expected to crest in northwest Missouri early Friday, with more cities and towns under threat. 
Voluntary evacuations were advised in the small riverfront city of St. Joseph, Mo., where the nation’s longest river is expected to crest about 6 a.m. local time. 
Debris-laden river water is expected to rise by between 29 and 31 feet (8.8 and 9.4 meters), just two feet below the height of protective levees, officials said, as the waters then head toward Kansas City about 55 miles (88 km) south and more population centers in Kansas and Missouri downstream. 
“This is serious, water could easily breach those levees,” David Roth of the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. 
The estimated crest height could quickly change just from a few degree differences in snow melt up stream, he said. The river could top levees or breach weak spots, he said. 
“Just an unexpected precipitation could fall upstream or temperatures spike up,” he said. 
Midwest daytime temperatures are already about 10-degrees Fahrenheit above normal, he said and will hit as high as 60 in parts of the Midwest Friday, including St. Joseph and Kansas City. 
Flooding of the Missouri River was triggered by last week’s so-called “bomb cyclone” storm that has already inflicted damage estimated at nearly $1.5 billion in Nebraska, killed at least four people in Nebraska and Iowa and left a man missing below Nebraska’s collapsed Spencer Dam.[L1N21809A] 
“This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk,” said Ed Clark, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in the agency’s spring outlook. 
Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency for his state Wednesday as high water forced evacuations of several small farm communities. 
The declaration allows state resources and assistance to be provided directly to counties and municipalities in need. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska, making federal funding available in nine counties there that bore the brunt of last week’s floods. 
The threat of extensive flooding lingers over the wider region and could grow dire in coming weeks with additional rainfall and melting snow runoff, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials said on Thursday.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with five Caribbean leaders on Friday who have sided with the United States and most Western countries in backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as head of state. 
Trump will meet with leaders from the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and Saint Lucia at his private club in Palm Beach, Florida. 
The response to OPEC-member Venezuela’s political crisis has split the members of the Caribbean Community, known as CARICOM. 
The organization has officially advocated for talks between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Guaido. Most of its members have rejected resolutions by the Organization of American States supporting Guaido. 
Guaido, who heads Venezuela’s national assembly, invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency in January, saying Maduro’s election last year was not legitimate. Maduro, who still has the support of Venezuela’s military, has clung to power with the support of Russia, China and Cuba. 
The Caribbean region has long relied on oil and gas from Venezuela, which offered cheap financing through a program called Petrocaribe, though shipments have declined in recent years because of production problems at Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. 
The tensions put at risk regional efforts to try to capitalize on deepwater oil and gas exploration, said Anthony Bryan, a Caribbean energy expert and associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
“CARICOM is the body that speaks for energy sustainability in the region. But if you start dividing the states - as apparently an attempt is being made to do - then you, in a sense, almost sabotage from the very beginning that unity that is necessary,” Bryan said in an interview. 
The region has also been the recipient of a flood of investment from China. The White House said earlier this week that Trump wants to work with leaders to “counter China’s predatory economic practices.” 
The meeting is also an opportunity for Trump to try to turn the page on derogatory comments about Haiti that he was reported to have made. At a January 2018 White House meeting about immigration, Trump referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries,” according to a Democratic senator who was there. 
Trump on Twitter later denied saying “anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.”

"NEW ORLEANS “I know where I live,” said Keith Daggett. Daggett’s home sits by the London Avenue Canal. The floodwall along the canal breached during Hurricane Katrina more than 13 years ago. An outdoor exhibition now stands at the site of the devastation, marking the flooding caused by the failures of the canal. “Yes, there is a flood risk here,” said Daggett, who recently moved to the neighborhood. Tulane University environmental sciences professor Alex Kolker reiterated that the future of the area looks dire. “The neighborhood lies eight to 10 feet below the canal, and that’s an enormous flood risk,” said Kolker. Hydrogeologists said the city sinks 6 to 8 mm a year. A large part of the city is already below sea level, and the Gentilly neighborhood, where Daggett lives, is one of the fastest sinking areas. Dutch-based company Deltares drilling in New Orleans. It's part of a bigger project to make the city resilient in relation to climate change and sea level rise. (Deltares) Kolker is part of a team of researchers, which includes Dutch-based research institute Deltares and the Water Institute of the Gulf, trying to figure out which sections of the city are sinking, how fast, and why. They say subsidence was one reason why Katrina was catastrophic. Water flooded the low-lying areas and had to be pumped out. “After having experienced the damaged city in 2006 and working there all those years after, New Orleans became part of me. This project helps to collect the missing information needed to take appropriate measures to ensure the [city] is a safe place in the future in relation to sea level rise and changing climate dynamics,” said Roelof Sturrman, a water specialist at Deltares. The city-led project called “Reshaping the Urban Delta” is being funded by a $141.3 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It largely focuses on the city’s subsurface. Experts theorize the underlying geology could be one reason for the sinking, also known as subsidence. Homes by the London Avenue Canal in New Orleans sit eight to 10 feet below the canal, a flood risk for residents in the area. (Fox News) “There’s a whole bunch of old swamps beneath the city of New Orleans and when these swamps dry out the ground they take compact and compress and the ground above them sinks,” said Kolker. Cracked pipes could also play a part. “Water and mud can flow into them and erode the ground around them. And then you'd create a hole, and that hole is almost a sinkhole,” added Kolker. Stuurman believes managing the way water flows in and around the city could mitigate the rate of subsidence. Last week, Deltares led a group on several soil drilling operations around the city taking sediment samples, the first step of this study. “The objective was to determine the ‘mean lowest groundwater level’ and the amount of organic material in the soil and clay saturation because these determine the subsidence risk,” said Stuurman. New Orleans is not alone in this ordeal. Tokyo and even parts of the Houston-Galveston area have sunk as well, particularly in the middle of the 20th century. The project will take about 18 months, culminating with the design and installation of an integrated water monitoring network. (Tulane University) “There, they did take a lot of effort to better monitor the rate at which they pulled out groundwater. And, that did help slow the subsidence in (the Houston-Galveston area),” said Kolker. Researchers said there’s an added sense of urgency as storms, especially in the Gulf Coast region, are expected to become stronger, thanks to climate change.

"Californians are preparing for the worst as heavy rains hit the state just weeks after two fires scorched Northern and Southern California. Over the last eight days, up to 10 inches of rain fell in Central and Northern California, so the ground is very saturated. The recent wildfires left nothing to hold the ground in place so the threat for mudslides is high where the Woolsey and Camp fires burned tens of thousands of acres. A new storm system moved into most of California overnight from north to south with heavy rainfall rates that have reached nearly 1 inch per hour. So far almost 2 inches of rain have fallen in Los Angeles County with more to come. As the storm continues to move through California, numerous flood, wind and snow alerts are posted from California to Nevada and into Arizona. A flash flood watch is in place for the area around Paradise, Calif., and Malibu, Calif., in the wake of this month's fires. As Thursday morning progresses, heavier rain will move into Southern California, around Malibu and Los Angeles, where the Woolsey Fire was located. ""With this rain coming in, we have a lot of steep hillsides, rocks that came down the hills a few days ago when we had a little bit of rain. We don't know what's going to happen today, but we want everybody to be prepared,"" said L.A. County Fire Department Capt. Brian Jordan. In the Inland Empire, residents have been told to evacuate parts of Lake Elsinore, Corona and Glen Eden, where the Holy Fire burned about 36 square miles in mid-August. Rain will also continue for Central and Northern California throughout Thursday, while heavy snow will be falling in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Heavy rain is falling in much of California, while snow falls in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on Thursday morning. The storm system will move inland Thursday evening with the rain continuing for parts of Southern California. It will also move into the southwest deserts of Nevada and Arizona. Snow will spread from the Sierra Nevadas to the central and southern Rockies in Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Heavy rain will continue in Southern California through Thursday evening. An additional 1 to 2 inches of rain is forecast for Southern California through the day Thursday with locally higher amounts. In the Sierra range, snow will pile up by the foot by Friday morning. The snow will also accumulate in feet in the Rockies with some areas getting 1 to 2 feet.

"So its possible to imagine adaptation rather than surrender as a different WASP strategy across the 1960s and 1970s. In such a world the establishment would have still admitted more blacks, Jews, Catholics and Hispanics (and more women) to its ranks but it would have done so as a self-consciously elite-crafting strategy, rather than under the pseudo-democratic auspices of the SAT and the high school resume and the dubious ideal of merit. At the same time it would have retained both its historic religious faith (instead of exchanging Protestant rigor for a post-Christian Social Gospel and a soft pantheism) and its more self-denying culture (instead of letting all that wash away in the flood of boomer-era emotivism). The goal would have been to keep piety and discipline embedded in the culture of a place like Harvard, rather than the mix of performative self-righteousness and raw ambition that replaced them. Such an effort might also have had spillover effects on politics. Its de rigueur for liberals to lament the decline of the Rockefeller Republicans, or the compromises that a moderate northeastern WASP like George H.W. Bush made with Sunbelt populism. But a WASP establishment that couldnt muster the self-confidence to hold on to Yale and Harvard was never likely to maintain its hold on a mass political organization like the G.O.P. Whereas an establishment that still believed in its mission within its own ivied bastions might have been seen as more politically imposing in the wider world instead of seeing its last paladin, a war hero and statesman in a grand American tradition, dismissed in the boomer era as a wimp. The point of this counterfactual is not to just join the nostalgic chorus around Bushs departure for the Great Kennebunkport in the Skies. Rather its to look forward, and to suggest that our current elite might someday be reformed or simply replaced through the imitation of the old establishment's more pious and aristocratic spirit. Right now, almost all the discussion of our meritocracys vices assumes the systems basic post-WASP premises, and hopes that either more inclusion (the pro-diversity lefts fixation) or a greater emphasis on academic merit (the anti-affirmative rights hobbyhorse) will cure our establishments all-too-apparent ills. But nostalgia for what was best about the old establishment might point to a more radical theory of the case, one proposed by Helen Andrews in a 2016 Hedgehog Review essay on meritocracy and its discontents: The meritocracy is hardening into an aristocracy so let it. Every society in history has had an elite, and what is an aristocracy but an elite that has put some care into making itself presentable? Allow the social forces that created this aristocracy to continue their work, and embrace the label. By all means this caste should admit as many worthy newcomers as is compatible with their sense of continuity. New brains, like new money, have been necessary to every ruling class, meritocratic or not. If ethnic balance is important to meritocrats, they should engineer it into the system. If geographic diversity strikes them as important, they should ensure that it exists, ideally while keeping an eye on the danger of hovering up all of the native talent from regional America. But they must give up any illusion that such tinkering will make them representative of the country over which they preside. They are separate, parochial in their values, unique in their responsibilities. That is what makes them aristocratic. This idea is heresy to our current ruling class; it would have been simple wisdom to the WASPs. If we would learn from their lost successes in our own era of misrule, reconsidering this idea that a ruling class should acknowledge itself for what it really is, and act accordingly might be a fruitful place to start.

"In 2015, the year President Donald Trump launched his White House bid with a promise to build a wall on the Mexico border, illegal migration to the United States plunged 31 percent, falling near its lowest level in 50 years.
Security experts saw a success, but Trump looked at the border and saw something ominous: ""rapists,"" ""criminals"" and other predators lurking on the other side.
In 2017, Trump's first year in office, he continued to insist on the urgent need for a border wall, even as illegal crossings dropped further.
With parts of the federal government shut down over what has morphed into the defining symbol of Trump's presidency, administration officials are clamoring louder than ever. Only this time, they face a bona fide emergency on the border, and they're struggling to make the case there's truly a problem.
Record numbers of migrant families are streaming into the United States, overwhelming border agents and leaving holding cells dangerously overcrowded with children, many of whom are falling sick. Two Guatemalan children taken into U.S. custody died in December.
In a letter to lawmakers Friday, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security made a fresh appeal to amend immigration laws they denounce as ""legal loopholes"" and blame for creating a ""border security and humanitarian crisis."" But the chance of reaching consensus for such technical fixes to U.S. immigration statutes is growing more remote, buried by the pitched battle over a structure new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., calls ""immoral.""
With both sides entrenched, there has been little bipartisan urgency to examine the relatively narrow set of legal and administrative changes that could potentially make a difference in slowing illegal migration or improving conditions for families who arrive at the border.
""There are places that need better fences or better walls; no one denies that,"" said Anthony Earl Wayne, a U.S. diplomat who served as ambassador to Mexico from 2011 to 2015. ""But I don't know how you get to that, while explaining to the public that we need to increase border security while meeting the human needs that are there.""
Instead, the policy debate has been overshadowed by an engineering project imbued with partisan emotion, with Trump fighting for billions of dollars in taxpayer funding and threatening to invoke emergency powers to build a wall without congressional approval. After failing to reach a deal with Democratic leaders, Trump seesawed Friday between characterizing the current border crisis as a ""dangerous horrible disaster"" and warning that the shutdown could stretch for ""months or years.""
Democratic leaders, pressed by liberal groups and immigrant rights activists, have dug in against Trump, accusing the president of pursuing a xenophobic agenda and throwing a ""temper tantrum,"" in the words of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
The risk of a prolonged stalemate is increasing as the wall fight becomes a referendum on the president, leaving little space to negotiate changes to the lesser-known statutes some administration officials see as the key to stanching the border surge.
""This is the triumph of symbolism over policy solutions,"" said Tamar Jacoby, a conservative who serves as president of ImmigrationWorks, a federation of small businesses that advocates for immigration reform.
""To find the balance between a humanitarian approach and an approach that encourages people to come in responsibly is not easy. It has to be handled carefully, thoughtfully and delicately,"" she said. ""But the debate going on is one of cartoon characters jousting when what we need are brain surgeons.""
The impasse marks Washington's latest failure in over nearly three decades of trying to reach consensus on a comprehensive overhaul of a massive immigration system that both political parties agree is largely broken. There are an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, according to a recent estimate from Pew Research Center, and there is no political consensus over their future.
Trump's most recent predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, supported unsuccessful bipartisan legislative efforts.
Current White House aides acknowledge privately that a wall will not adequately address the record surge of immigrant families at the border - most of whom surrender to authorities in hopes of winning asylum protections.
Last year, the Trump administration opposed and helped defeat a bipartisan Senate plan that would have provided $25 billion for the wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for up to 1.7 million young undocumented immigrants.
The president put his support behind a more conservative bill that would have amended ""loopholes"" in immigration law, allowing the administration to detain families for longer periods and speed up the huge backlog of asylum cases. But that plan, which also included massive cuts to legal immigration programs, was soundly defeated, as Democrats opposed rolling back protections for immigrant families.
Since then, Trump has attempted to use executive powers to tighten immigration rules, but during the summer he ended his administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents amid political backlash. Federal courts have blocked other hard-line measures from the administration, prompting Trump to focus on the border wall.
During a news conference Friday, Trump discussed ways to seize private land for the project, waxed on about the merits of a barrier made of steel instead of concrete, asserted falsely that Mexico would pay for it through a new trade agreement and repeated his warnings of terrorists at the border.
But he only briefly alluded to the humanitarian crisis, suggesting a wall would be the solution by dissuading women and children from attempting a dangerous journey.
If they ""know they can't get through because we have a great border wall or fence or barrier, they're not going to come up and you're not going to have the problem,"" Trump said.
In recent weeks, so many parents with children have been among the 2,000 unauthorized migrants who are being taken into federal custody each day that authorities have resorted to mass releases of families onto the streets of El Paso and other border cities. U.S. agents are bringing dozens of migrants coughing and feverish each day to clinics and hospitals after stays in jam-packed holding cells where children sleep on concrete floors and huddle in plastic sheets for warmth.
A group of Democratic lawmakers led by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will travel to New Mexico on Monday to the Border Patrol station where 8-year-old Felipe Alonso Gomez was detained before he died on Christmas Eve with flulike symptoms. But Democrats critical of the administration's treatment of migrant families have offered few solutions to stem the unprecedented influx of parents with children that is buckling the U.S. immigration system.
The government shutdown has made the strains worse. Many immigration judges have been furloughed, deepening dysfunction in a court system crippled by a backlog of nearly 1 million cases. Along the border, U.S. agents and officers are being forced to work indefinitely without pay. ""Morale is down in the dumps,"" said one border agent in South Texas who was not authorized to speak on the record.
Yet in Washington, the president has continued to sound the alarm for a border wall, appearing at the White House on Thursday with representatives of the Border Patrol union to make another pitch to reporters.
Adam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, said there appears to be little political incentive for conservatives to hash out a deal if it doesn't deliver on Trump's signature issue. With Trump eyeing a re-election bid amid increasing pressure from his conservative base, the debate over the wall could dominate Washington for the foreseeable future.
""They are stuck on this wall thing because of its emotional appeal,"" he said.","In 2015, the year President Donald Trump launched his White House bid with a promise to build a wall on the Mexico border, illegal migration to the United States plunged 31 percent, falling near its lowest level in 50 years.

"(Reuters) - Shuttered U.S. government agencies remained closed on Monday, as Democrats in the House of Representatives readied legislation intended to reopen the government that would not meet President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion to fund a border wall. 
Funding for about a quarter of the federal government came to an end on Dec. 22, with Trump and Democrats far apart on a solution. 
On Thursday, Democrats intend to vote on a two-part package to end the shutdown. Its prospects in the Senate and with Trump were uncertain. 
The shutdown has not affected most of the government, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, which have secure funding. Still, some 800,000 employees from the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation and others have been furloughed or are working without pay. 
Here is what is happening at key federal agencies. 
HOMELAND SECURITY 
The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected. But most employees are deemed “essential,” so are working without pay until a funding bill is passed. 
Of 245,000 department employees, nearly 213,000 have been deemed essential, said the department’s contingency plan. 
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT 
Most of this department’s 7,500 employees are deemed “non-essential,” with only about 340 working. Nearly 1,000 others may be called in for specific tasks, for which they will not be paid until a funding bill is passed. 
Public housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down. But the federal government provides some of their funding, so they may need to reduce or change operating hours. 
The department, which oversees some housing loan and low-income housing payment programs, warned in its contingency plan that “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we’ve been experiencing.” 
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT 
The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau are not publishing economic data during the shutdown, including key figures on gross domestic product, inflation, personal income, spending, trade and new home sales. 
OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
The agency that oversees the federal workforce has offered advice to workers on how to deal with landlords, mortgage lenders and other creditors. It includes sample letters with language explaining severe reductions in income due to the lack of federal funding for departments and agencies. 
COAST GUARD 
Members of the U.S. Coast Guard were due to receive their final paychecks of the year on Monday. That paycheck will be their last until the government reopens. 
FEMA 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency was to resume issuing new flood insurance policies during the shutdown, reversing an earlier decision. The National Association of Realtors estimated an earlier decision to stop issuing new policies could have disrupted up to 40,000 home sales each month. 
INTERIOR 
The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, is operating with a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, some parks may be accessible, with others closed completely. The National Park Service is providing no visitor services such as restrooms, facility and road maintenance and trash collection. 
TRANSPORTATION 
Of the department’s 55,000 employees, 20,400 have been put on leave. Those do not include most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 are working, or the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources. 
Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits have been paused. 
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
An estimated 1,100 of the office’s 1,800 employees are on leave. This includes most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps implement budget and policy goals.

"Watch John Hickenlooper answer questions at a CNN Town Hall on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET. Hickenlooper, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, is the former governor of Colorado (2011-2019). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)One of the defining experiences of my life came in the mid-1980s. After working for two years as a geologist in Colorado, I lost my job and my career during that long recession. Struggling to find work, some friends and I decided to start a small business in an undeveloped part of Denver in 1988. Two years later, we built a successful brew pub and eventually opened up over a dozen more around the Midwest. This is the essence of the American Dream -- in the land of opportunity, if you have a good idea, create a solid plan, and work hard, you should be able to reinvent yourself and get ahead.
But today, new jobs are disproportionately low-wage and low-skill. They are less secure and pay less than before. In our ""hour glass"" economy, we have large swaths stuck at the bottom, a hollowed out middle, and a top growing with sky-high incomes and wealth. 
There are more disruptions coming. Advances in automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, while increasing productivity, will also cause major upheavals to the workforce. Some estimate that as much as a third of the workforce will need to change occupations by 2030 and there is no clear national strategy to respond to the disruption. Both federal and corporate investment in employment and training should be ramping up, yet they've dropped dramatically since the 1980s.
I understand the anxiety and fear that comes from disruption. We need to bring people together to develop and invest in a historic effort that addresses the challenges facing the American workforce, to minimize the gap between the skills our people have and the skills a 21st century economy needs. I am calling for a national strategy for the American workforce. America only works when the economy works for everyone, especially for the nearly 70 percent of Americans who will not graduate with a four year college degree.
The American people know there are models that work and can be scaled. While I was the governor in Colorado, we launched Skillful.com, a program for job-seekers seeking to develop their skills, and employers to hire based on those skills. It offers predictive tools so that workers can see tomorrow's jobs and acquire the skills to get them. For our kids, we created Careerwise, a pilot collaboration with businesses and schools.
The program allows high school students to ""earn while they learn"" as apprentices in the growing fields of IT, financial services, advanced manufacturing and healthcare. And while college is not the only answer, in Denver, we created the Denver Scholarship Foundation which helps low income and first generation college students to attend and graduate from college. 
We created initiatives like the Business Experiential Learning Commission and Colorado Innovation Network to make sure that we were adjusting to changes and growing our future talent ecosystem. This strategic thinking and planning is what helped drive Colorado from 40th in job creation to, according to US News and World Report, the number one economy in the nation these past two years. 
A national strategy for the American workforce would mean an investment of historic proportions in skills training and apprenticeships. It would enlist labor unions, good corporate citizens, and civic organizations to join a national effort that ensures people have the skills companies need to drive our economy forward. 
We can do this by reimagining the role of the employer where upskilling and reskilling will become a benefit of employment rather than an inadequate government retraining program after someone loses a job. 
While some people simply want to villainize the private sector, the fact is that the private sector drives jobs growth; we need to channel the energy and innovation of employers to generate opportunities for the entire labor market. 
The traditional definition of a job is shifting in the future, but today, we need to make sure work really pays and that people have adequate benefits. That's why a national plan for the American workforce would increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, would rethink the employment system so that it supports people in the ""gig"" economy, and create paid family and medical leave. This isn't a small part of our labor market -- 43% of the workforce could be participating in the ""gig"" economy by 2020. I also believe that we absolutely must achieve universal medical coverage, so that people can change jobs, change careers, or start new businesses like I did, without worrying whether they will have a gap in health insurance or access to a retirement savings vehicle. 
Ultimately, a national strategy for the American workforce seeks to push the country toward a new economic model, which creates more equitable patterns of growth. While we need to shut down tax loopholes and end the flood of tax breaks for the largest corporations, redistribution can never do as much for the middle class as the kind of broad-based growth our country has enjoyed during its best periods. 
The traditional definition of a job is shifting; we need to ensure that everyone has the same access to opportunities that will expand our current talent ecosystem and grow the mighty middle of our economy now and in the future.","One of the defining experiences of my life came in the mid-1980s.

"A major storm developing in the central U.S. is bringing ongoing severe weather across the south, a flash flood threat to parts of the Gulf Coast and a major winter storm in the Northern Plains and upper Midwest. There was one reported tornado in eastern Oklahoma overnight as several tornado warnings were issued in the eastern parts of the state. Additionally, there were nearly 60 reports of strong winds from northern Texas to southern Missouri. Numerous tornado warnings were issued during the overnight hours in southern Missouri, where winds reached 83 mph. The U.S. averages 24 tornadoes in December with most developing in the southern U.S. A tornado watch is in effect for parts of Arkansas and Missouri on Saturday morning. A clear circulation was evident on radar and satellite imagery across Kansas on Saturday morning. This developing major storm will slowly move east during the day. A tornado watch is in effect for parts of Missouri and Arkansas through the early Saturday morning hours as a line of strong storms moves through the region. A couple of tornadoes will be possible through the early morning hours in the watch area. The risk will diminish by mid-Saturday morning in this region. Heavy rain has spread from eastern Kansas to Florida and snow is beginning to develop across parts of Nebraska. Heavy snow will fall in the Plains while severe storms and heavy rain move into the South on Saturday. Travel conditions will become hazardous on Saturday morning with heavy snow developing in parts of Nebraska and South Dakota. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are likely with winds gusting to 35 mph in parts of the Northern Plains. This will cause near whiteout conditions. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect for much of the northern U.S. from Montana to northern Iowa. A slight risk for severe weather exists along the Gulf Coast and in southern Illinois on Saturday. The severe weather threat will nudge eastward later in the day Saturday with two main areas of concern under a slight risk for severe weather: the Gulf states from Louisiana to Florida, including much of Alabama, and parts of eastern Missouri and much of Illinois. In these slight-risk areas, strong winds, brief tornadoes and hail will all be possible. Additionally, an onslaught of heavy rain is expected for parts of the Florida Panhandle, extreme southern Georgia and Alabama. A flash flood watch has been issued for parts of this region, as locally 3 to 5 inches of rain is possible this weekend, with the bulk of it coming Saturday. This flood threat includes Panama City, Florida, and Dothan, Alabama. Heavy snow will fall on Saturday through parts of the Midwest and Northern Plains with a significant impacts to roadways and possible flight delays at region airports. Severe storms will move into the Southeast on Saturday night as snow continues to fall in the Plains. As some of this precipitation moves into the Northeast late Saturday night, it will encounter some colder air. As a result, some precipitation may fall as a mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet in parts of the interior Northeast. However, up to 1 inch of snow and a one-tenth of an inch of ice is expected from parts of New York to Maine. This could cause dangerous travel overnight Saturday into early Sunday morning. As warmer air moves in from the south on Sunday morning, temperatures will change the precipitation to rain. Borderline icy events can be extremely impactful on the roads. On Sunday, the severe threat will slide toward the Southeast coast with a slight risk of severe weather from parts of Georgia to extreme southeast North Carolina. In the slight risk area there is a possibility of strong winds, brief tornadoes and hail. A mix of rain and ice moves into the Northeast late Saturday and into Sunday morning. The greatest snow totals will be across parts of Nebraska, where locally over 1 foot of snow will fall. The combination of strong winds and heavy snow could cause some power outages in the region. Widespread snowfall totals of 6 to 12 inches are possible from Kansas to Wisconsin. The heaviest snowfall totals over the weekend will come in central Nebraska.",The storm sparked at least one tornado overnight.,2018-12-01T11:02:12Z,"Major storm bringing severe weather to South, whiteout conditions to Northern Plains",ABC News,1
"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More Americans blame President Donald Trump than congressional Democrats for the partial U.S. government shutdown, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday found, as lawmakers returned to Washington with no quick end to the shutdown in sight. 
Forty-seven percent of adults hold Trump responsible, while 33 percent blame Democrats in Congress, according to the Dec. 21-25 poll, conducted mostly after the shutdown began. Seven percent of Americans blamed congressional Republicans. 
The shutdown was triggered by Trump’s demand, largely opposed by Democrats and some Republicans, that taxpayers provide him with $5 billion to help pay for a wall he wants to build on the Mexican border. Its total estimated cost is $23 billion. 
Just 35 percent of those surveyed in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they backed including money for the wall in a congressional spending bill. Only 25 percent said they supported Trump shutting down the government over the matter. 
The shutdown, now in its sixth day, has a had limited impact so far, partly due to vacations for the 800,000 federal workers affected, though that could change soon. 
Government agencies began notifying the public on Thursday about service disruptions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said the shutdown means it cannot process new flood insurance policies, possibly disrupting home sales. 
The Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the federal workforce, offered advice to government employees on staving off creditors if paychecks lapse. 
On Capitol Hill, the Senate and House of Representatives were set to reconvene late on Thursday, but no prompt action by them was expected. The lack of urgency fueled speculation among analysts that the shutdown could drag on well into January. 
The wall dispute coincided with the expiration of funding for about 20 percent of the government. The remaining 80 percent is fully funded and is unaffected by the shutdown. 
The departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Agriculture, Commerce and other agencies, shut down “non-essential” operations on Saturday after a tentative funding deal collapsed over Trump’s renewed insistence that wall funding be provided. 
The House has approved a shutdown-ending spending measure that includes Trump’s demand for $5 billion, but its prospects in the Senate were seen as poor. 
Trump argues that his wall is needed to stem illegal immigration and drugs entering the country - a key plank in his 2016 presidential campaign. 
Earlier this month, he said he would be “proud to shut down the government” over wall funding. On Twitter, since the shutdown started, he has tried to blame the Democrats. 
In a tweet on Thursday, he framed the shutdown as a partisan issue, saying, “Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?” 
The assertion, for which Trump provided no evidence, drew immediate criticism from Democrats.

“Federal employees don’t go to work wearing red or blue jerseys,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner wrote on Twitter. 
“They’re public servants. And the president is treating them like poker chips at one of his failed casinos,” Warner said. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 2,440 adults, including 946 Democrats and 846 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll’s precision, of two percentage points for the entire sample and four points for members of either political party.

"(Reuters) - The collapse of a Brazilian tailings dam owned by Vale last week ranks among the worst mining disasters in decades. More than 300 people are feared dead after the dam failure near the town of Brumadinho released a torrent of mining waste into Vale’s facilities and a nearby community in Minas Gerais state. 
The IndustriALL union, which represents mining and energy, said the Brazilian dam disaster is already recognized as the most deadly labor accident in the history of Brazil. 
It follows on from the country’s worst environmental incident in November 2015 when the collapse of the Samarco dam, operated by Vale and BHP, resulted in the death of 19 people. 
Both the Samarco and the Brumadinho disasters involve the failure of upstream tailings dams.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s annual National People’s Congress (NPC) kicked off on Tuesday with Premier Li Keqiang’s presentation of the government work report, in which he announced a lower economic growth target of 6.0-6.5 percent this year. 
Li also pledged billions of dollars of cuts to taxes and fees to shore up an economy growing at its slowest pace in almost 30 years. 
Here is an overview of Li’s comments on monetary policy, fiscal policy, the yuan, interest rates and bonds: 
MONETARY POLICY 
Li said China’s monetary policy would be prudent and “neither too tight nor too loose”, and that the government would not resort to a flood of liquidity. He said China will use various monetary policy tools, enhance channels for policy transmission and maintain reasonably ample liquidity. 
Growth targets for M2 money supply, which includes cash in circulation and deposits, and total social financing this year would be in line with nominal GDP growth, Li said. 
FISCAL POLICY 
China will step up its proactive fiscal policy, setting a budget deficit of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 2018’s 2.6 percent target. 
The Ministry of Finance said fiscal revenue will be increased by 5 percent and spending by 6.5 percent. 
For the full year, China plans to cut corporate burdens by nearly 2 trillion yuan ($298.2 billion). Li said the government will reduce the value-added tax (VAT) for the manufacturing sector to 13 percent from 16 percent. The VAT for the transport and construction sectors will be cut to 9 percent from 10 percent. 
YUAN 
China will improve the formation mechanism of the yuan’s exchange rate and keep the currency basically stable at reasonable levels, Li said. 
The Chinese central bank sets a daily mid-point in the country’s onshore foreign exchange market. The yuan is allowed to trade no more than 2 percentage points above or below that level against the dollar, to control volatility. 
The yuan is also traded offshore, mostly in Hong Kong, where there is no trading band. 
A more detailed report released on Tuesday by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said China will also increase the yuan’s exchange rate flexibility and strengthen regulations on cross-border capital flows in 2019. 
The state planner said it will make efforts to keep equity, bond and currency markets stable, and will react to abnormal fluctuations in a timely manner to prevent and fend off financial risks. 
INTEREST RATES 
Li pledged to deepen market-oriented reforms in interest rates and to lower borrowing costs. 
China will use policy tools such as reserve requirement ratios and interest rates in a timely manner to guide financial institutions to expand credit and lower loan costs to support the real economy. 
The NDRC said it will keep market rates reasonably stable. 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BONDS 
The Finance Ministry said it will grant local governments a quota of 2.15 trillion yuan for special bond issuances this year, sharply higher than the 1.35 trillion yuan quota it granted in 2018. 
The local government bond issuance quota was set at 3.08 trillion yuan for this year.

"BOAO, China (Reuters) - China will allow greater market access for foreign banks and insurance companies, especially in its financial services sector, Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday. 
He added China will publish a revised negative list for foreign investors and issue rules for foreign acquisitions of Chinese listed firms. 
Li’s remarks, made in a speech at the annual Boao forum held on China’s southern island of Hainan, add to speculation that China may soon announce new rules that will allow foreign banks and insurance firms to increase their presence in China. 
China has pledged to further open its massive financial markets to foreign investors since last year amid a simmering trade war with the United States. Foreign businesses have long complained that liberalization has been too narrow and on-the-ground implementation spotty. 
A senior official at the China’s banking and insurance regulator said in a speech last week that Beijing is studying a new round of opening for the financial sector, aiming to achieve the dual goals of greater access as well as stability. 
Li added China is also drafting rules related to a new foreign investment law that was passed earlier this month. The rules are expected to be completed this year. 
“HARD BATTLE” 
In the same speech, Li also sought to ease investors’ concerns over China’s cooling economy, saying Beijing has enough policy tools to fight a “hard battle”. 
Li said China will cut “real interest rate levels” and lower financing costs for Chinese companies, but did not elaborate on which interest rate he was referring to. Li had made similar comments in a speech earlier this month. 
Some analysts say shockingly weak industrial profit data on Wednesday have added urgency for more policy easing. 
China’s industrial firms posted their worst slump in profits since late 2011 in the first two months of this year as slowing demand at home and abroad took a heavier toll on businesses. 
Analysts at Capital Economics said they believe the benchmark lending rate will be cut in the weeks ahead, though sources have told Reuters such a move may be a last resort if the economy does not show signs of responding to previous support measures. 
Others China watchers say policymakers may be waiting for March and first-quarter data in mid-April for a better picture of whether conditions are starting to stabilize. 
Li said he could not rule out the possibility that there were be some fluctuations in the world’s second-largest economy this year, but added that earlier policy steps were gaining traction. 
However, Chinese policymakers, including Li, have stressed that Beijing would not resort to “flood-like” stimulus that would unleash huge amounts of cheap credit, out of concern that could add to a mountain of debt. 
The central bank has not cut benchmark rates since the last downturn in 2015, but it has been guiding financing costs lower since last year through various means including liquidity injections. 
The central bank’s fourth-quarter monetary report showed the policy loosening appears to be having some effect, with a drop in average borrowing costs. But a private Beige Book Chinese business survey released on Wednesday showed some firms were reporting higher interest rates, especially those who had turned to shadow bank lending for funds. 
China’s economic growth cooled to 6.6 percent last year, the slowest pace in nearly 30 years, and analysts polled by Reuters expect a further pullback to 6.3 percent in 2019.

"U.S. border officials said Friday they saw an abrupt drop-off in illegal crossings during the holiday season, but the number of Central Americans arriving in family groups has returned to record levels since then.
The lull in unauthorized crossings suggests some Central American migrants - and the smuggling organizations that deliver them to the border - may have taken a break or deferred the journey north until after the holidays.
During the first week of January, when the extended Christmas season was still being celebrated in Mexico and Central America, the number of migrant family members taken into custody by U.S. agents fell to as low as 200 on some days, according to preliminary data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
By the middle of January, the number of families members arriving jumped again, reaching as high as 1,400 per day, and smuggling organizations once more began delivering groups of 300 or more parents and children to remote border crossings in Arizona and New Mexico.
A CBP official told reporters Friday that about 75 percent of the family members detained in January arrived during the second half of the month. Family groups accounted for 59 percent of all border apprehensions, and although the total number of parents and children taken into custody - 24,116 - declined slightly from December, ""that still represents one of the highest totals we have on record,"" one official said.
Overall, CBP carried out 58,207 arrests and detentions in January, down 4 percent over the previous month, the latest figures show.
President Donald Trump last spring ordered a ""zero tolerance"" prosecution push at the border that led to the separation of at least 2,500 families before he halted the measures amid a torrent of criticism. Since then, the number of parents arriving with children has accounted for an ever-growing share of border arrests, as the family groups arrive seeking to turn themselves in to U.S. agents and request asylum or some form of humanitarian protection.
The families are typically processed and released from federal custody after a few days, with a hearing in immigration court that may be months or years away. Critics deride this model as ""catch and release,"" and say it is adding to a legal backlog that has pushed U.S. immigration courts to the brink of collapse.
The number of ""family unit"" members taken into custody is up 290 percent during the first four months of the government's 2019 fiscal year, compared with the same period last year.
While migration trends have historically followed seasonal patterns, the holiday lull documented last month was especially pronounced.
Homeland Security officials say they are studying intelligence data to better understand why arrest numbers fell so sharply. The arrival of large groups of Central American families is once more placing strains on Border Patrol stations, officials said Friday.
On Thursday a group of 325 parents and children crossed the border illegally west of Lukeville, Arizona, according to CBP officials in the agency's Tucson sector.
The crowd was first spotted by one of the agency's remote cameras, and a CBP team arrived by helicopter to find a large group of people making a bonfire in freezing temperatures.
It was the latest in a series of mass border-crossings in isolated areas with few agents and minimal fencing. According to CBP, ""the group illegally entered the country through an area where there is only a vehicle barrier designed to prevent crossings.""
The migrants told CBP officials that buses and trucks had dropped them off along a desert highway throughout the night, and the 325 crossed the border together at 8 a.m. to wait for Border Patrol agents to pick them up.
The CBP officials, who insisted on anonymity to share the data with reporters, said narcotics traffickers use these large groups as a diversion to move drugs into the United States while agents are busy processing families with children.
Trump ordered 3,750 additional military personnel to the border this week. Typically, the troops do not interact with migrants, but CBP officials said service members have provided some transportation and medical support to assist busy border agents.","U.S. border officials said Friday they saw an abrupt drop-off in illegal crossings during the holiday season, but the number of Central Americans arriving in family groups has returned to record levels since then.

"Scientists warned Sunday that a massive iceberg will soon calve — or break off — from Antarctica's Brunt Ice Shelf and they're increasingly concerned about the ""uncertain future"" it creates for future research opportunities there.
The iceberg is expected to be about twice the size of New York City, according to NASA scientists, who have observed cracks growing across the ice shelf in recent years.
""It is not yet clear how the remaining ice shelf will respond following the break, posing an uncertain future for scientific infrastructure and a human presence on the shelf that was first established in 1955,"" the scientists wrote.
ANCIENT ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET COLLAPSE COULD CAUSE A GLOBAL FLOOD
As one notable crack, which appeared in October 2016, continues to progress east, scientists said their ""more immediate concern"" is a large rift running through the Brunt Ice Shelf. NASA said that while the rift was ""previously stable for about 35 years, this crack recently started accelerating northward as fast as 4 kilometers (nearly 2.5 miles) per year.""

When that rift makes its way toward the other crack, an estimated 660 square miles of ice will break from the shelf, scientists warned.

"When she purchased the house, she was told she needed flood insurance. Ms. Harrison does not dispute that her house is on the lake. It just happens to be a lung-burning 120 steps above the lake. She said one surveyor even told her that if her house ever flooded, the entire city of Coeur dAlene would be underwater. Nevertheless, she was paying $2,700 a year for flood insurance, on top of $3,200 in homeowners insurance. As expensive as that is, challenging those requirements takes a substantial investment in money and time. Homeowners cant just take a photo of, say, the dusty Texas ground or the slope of their hill on a lake. They have to prove that they are not in a flood zone. Doing this is complicated because the maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, indicate that these homes are, indeed, in a flood zone. How they were placed there is not always logical. With so many floods and so many claims being paid FEMA regularly redraws its flood zone maps, which often means expanding the zones into a wider area. The result is that more homeowners pay into the National Flood Insurance Program, which gives the agency more money to pay claims. But given their houses locations, some of those people shouldnt have to pay. Yet until someone tells them otherwise, they keep paying. Thats what happened to Christopher Jones, a disabled United States Army veteran. His five-acre farm in Elm Mott, Tex., outside of Waco, has a pond, but the closest body of water that could flood it is the Brazos River, which is over 50 miles away and until recently was at drought levels.","Low-lying coastal areas like West Columbia, Tex., above, shown devastated by Hurricane Harvey, are always vulnerable to flooding.

"Theres some parallel with military spending. In the 1950s and 60s, during the Cold War, the United States spent more than 10 percent of G.D.P. on national defense (its now below 4 percent).
Most of that spending crowded out other forms of economic activity; many houses and cars and washing machines werent made because of the resources that instead went to making tanks, bombs and fighter jets. But some of that spending also created long-term benefits for society, like the innovations that led to the internet and to reliable commercial jet aircraft travel.
Certain types of efforts to reduce carbon emissions or adapt to climate impacts are likely to generate similar benefits, says Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.
You couldnt provide sea defenses at large scale without very heavy investment, but its not investment of the kind that you get from the things that breed technological progress, Mr. Stern said. The defensive adaptations dont carry anything like the dynamism that comes from different ways of doing things.
There is more fertile ground in areas like transportation and infrastructure, he said. Electric cars, instead of those with internal combustion engines, would mean less air pollution in cities, for example. 
Seeking a baseline to devise environmental regulations, the Obama administration set out to calculate a social cost of carbon, the amount of harm each new ton of carbon emissions will cause in decades ahead.
At the core of the project were sophisticated efforts to model how a hotter earth will affect thousands of different places. Thats necessary because a low-lying region that already has many hot days a year is likely to face bigger problems, sooner, than a higher-altitude location that currently has a temperate climate.","Wading through flood waters from Tropical Storm Harvey in Houston in August 2017. “We know we can adapt to slow changes,” a Yale economist said. “Rapid changes are the ones that would be most damaging and painful.”",2019-01-17T10:00:00Z,How to Think About the Costs of Climate Change,The New York Times,0
"(CNN)Archaeologists excavated the site of a previously unknown 15th-century mass sacrifice in Peru and discovered the skeletons of 137 children, three adults and more than 200 juvenile llamas, according to a new study. The researchers say that the displaced ribs and cut marks on the sternums of the human and animal bones suggest their hearts were removed. 
The findings were published in the journal PLOS on Wednesday.
The site was excavated between 2011 and 2016 after local residents said they saw bones in eroding roadside dunes. 
The well-preserved remains were found over 700 square meters where the Chimú state culture lived along Peru's coast during the 15th century. The Chimú state was at its peak then, one of the most powerful in the Americas. 
From A.D. 900 to 1500, the fight for political, economic and religious control of the region caused warfare and massacres across Peru's northern coast as the state expanded. This was also when the Chimú state flourished, controlling hundreds of miles of coastline and far inland in multiple directions. Its people were at the heart of an extensive trade network and used hydraulic canals to support their prosperous agriculture. 
At the heart of it all was the capital, Chan Chan, one of the largest settlements at the time. It included palaces, gardens, temples and plazas. It was perfectly situated between the fields, desert, mountains, wetlands and the Pacific Ocean. 
While sacrifices were part of ancient cultures, there was previously very little evidence that they happened along Peru's northern coast. A site in a Peruvian seaside town excavated in 1969 revealed 17 children and 20 llamas buried together. It was presumed to be a sacrificial site, but at the time, it was an isolated finding. 
The newly excavated Huanchaquito-Las Llamas site is beach sand about a quarter-mile from the shore, and part of the site has been disturbed in recent years due to construction. 
At this site, there were no grave goods to speak of, and the bodies were found in unusual positions, suggesting that it wasn't a typical burial ground. 
The children were boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 14, with the majority falling between 8 and 12. Anatomical and genetic evidence, including skulls that had been modified and shaped while the children were growing, showed that they came from different ethnic groups and regions. 
The researchers said there would be even more children among the total if incomplete remains from the site had been included. 
The children were buried in groups of three, increasing in age. Some of them wore face paint or headdresses that were applied before the sacrifice. The llamas were next to or on top of the human skeletons and were alternating in color, largely brown and beige. 
The children were buried facing the sea, and the llamas were facing the mountains. The children wore no shoes, only simple cotton shrouds, and were found curled on their sides, lying flat or crouched on their backs. 
The study authors believe that someone with ""an experienced hand"" sliced open the sternums of the children and the llamas and forcefully opened their chests to remove their hearts.
There were also three adults: one man and two women. One woman was 18 years old, and the other was between 20 and 30. One probably died from a blow to the head, and the other showed signs of blunt force trauma to the face, but there was no identifiable cause of death. The man was between 30 and 40 years old and had multiple rib fractures, and no cause of death could be identified in his case, either. 
The two women were buried face-down and crouched on their knees, and the man was buried on his back. Due to their placement and proximity to the children, they were associated with the ritual sacrifice. 
The llamas were all less than a year and a half old, with the majority being less than 9 months old. The researchers believe this was purposeful, to match with the young ages of the children. While there were a range of different colors of llamas, including beige, light brown, dark brown and mixed colors, brown was the most common, which suggests that it was chosen on purpose. 
To the north, a single llama was found buried with a pair of ceramic jars and wooden paddles, all associated with the Chimú funerary process.
A thick layer of mud covered the area beneath the skeletons, suggesting that a massive rainstorm or flood happened before the sacrifice and may have even inspired it. 
Some of the mud was still well-preserved enough to show the footprints of children and llamas as they walked to the site of their death. 
Radiocarbon dating allowed the researchers to determine that the sacrifice occurred in 1450. The discovery is the largest known mass sacrifice of both children and llamas in the Americas. 
But why did it happen? Only further study will help the researchers \\ learn more about the lives lost at the site. But they believe that the rainfall or flooding from El Niño could have affected the Chimú state's economic, political and ideological stability. 
""This archaeological discovery was a surprise to all of us -- we had not seen anything like this before, and there was no suggestion from ethnohistoric sources or historic accounts of child or camelid sacrifices being made on such a scale in northern coastal Peru,"" John Verano, study author and professor of anthropology at Tulane University, said in a statement. ""We were fortunate to be able to completely excavate the site and to have a multidisciplinary field and laboratory team to do the excavation and preliminary analysis of the material. This site opens a new chapter on the practice of child sacrifice in the ancient world.""
The researchers will continue their investigation to study this connection between child sacrificial practices in the Americas in relation to environmental catastrophes.
""Thanks to National Geographic and FONDECYT Peru we are digging a new site located a couple of miles north of Huanchaquito Las Llamas that has evidence of another massive sacrificial ground,"" Gabriel Prieto, study author and assistant professor in archaeology at the National University of Trujillo, Peru, wrote in an email.

"Nationwide, about 450,000 government-subsidized households about 8 to 9 percent are in flood plains, according to a 2017 report by the Furman Center at New York University.
Many of those, including traditional public housing, low-income housing for older people and Section 8 properties like the one in Houston, are financed by HUD. There are also properties in flood plains that receive tax credits to rent to low-income tenants, which are subsidized with other federal money allocated to states.
But the federal governments maps to assess risk are based partly on historical data and dont necessarily account for climate effects, like increased local precipitation, said Laurie Schoeman, a disaster recovery and resilience specialist for Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit group based in Maryland.
If anything, she said, that is an underestimate of areas that are at risk.
Climate change is putting everyone at greater risk for natural disasters, including flooding, wildfires and drought. Low-income and minority communities are especially vulnerable. Families like those at Arbor Court, who qualify for assistance and are 95 percent black, are not only among the least able to recover when disaster strikes, but they also tend to live in flooding-prone areas because the land was historically cheaper to build on.
Robert D. Bullard, an environmental justice advocate and a professor at Texas Southern University in Houston, said that subsidizing low-income families in flood zones overlaid with the governments record of redlining and placing African-American families near industrial sites and other undesirable areas.
Its the same history, he said.
When Ms. White moved into Arbor Court, she said, she had no idea it was at risk of flooding. But one night in 2016, water came bursting through a wall in her bathroom, she said, sending her and her two children fleeing to a neighbors apartment upstairs. By daylight, the area around the complex looked like a lake.","Residents at Arbor Court Apartments in Houston are among hundreds of thousands of Americans who live in government-subsidized housing that is at serious risk of flooding, a danger heightened by climate change.",2019-04-11T09:00:11Z,"‘I Don’t Want to Stay Here’: Half a Million Live in Flood Zones, and the Government Is Paying",The New York Times,0
"Mr. Nixon declined to comment, and Mr. Tucker, who is suing the galleries, did not respond to attempts to contact him. Mr. Gottlieb, one of Mr. Tuckers lawyers, said that his clients come to him, and that he does not go looking for plaintiffs.
Lawsuits remain a crucial way to ensure the disabled have access to the world around them, their advocates say; and having settlements cover attorneys fees means that people without tens of thousands of dollars to spare can hire a lawyer. But some advocates fear that giant batches of lawsuits, filed in quick succession and then settled confidentially, may do more harm than good, even if they get individual websites to change their practices.
It gives a bad impression of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and it gives a bad impression about the importance of web accessibility, said Lainey Feingold, a disability-rights lawyer whose focus is on digital accessibility.
Drive-by lawsuits, as critics often call them, have been an issue dating back to the 1990s, when they were more focused on physical access to buildings. A recent bill called the ADA Education and Reform Act would have required a written complaint and given businesses a grace period to begin necessary fixes before they could be sued. It passed the House in the last Congress, mostly with Republican support. But it was vigorously opposed by the National Federation of the Blind because, a spokesman said, it made it more difficult for the disabled to get their needs addressed. The Senate did not take up the bill.
The cost to fix an existing website can vary enormously. Lisa Spellman, the owner and director of the 303 Gallery in Chelsea, said it would cost her $3,000 to $4,000. Philippe Alexandre, the president of the Alexandre Gallery in Midtown, said he paid a consultant $150 to install an audio component to his site. Expert testimony in a case against Winn-Dixie, the grocery store chain, estimated it would run the company $37,000.
Mr. Borghi said that he was happy to make his gallerys website accessible and that he was able to do it with a free widget from WordPress, which added narration, larger fonts and keyboard navigation.

"An alarming new study shows that ice in Antarctica is melting more than six times faster than it did in the 1980s, including areas that were thought to be relatively stable and resistant to change.
The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that Antarctic ice melting between 1979 to 2017 raised global sea levels more than 1.4 centimeters and the ice loss is accelerating dramatically — a key indicator of human-caused climate change. Scientists used aerial photographs, satellite measurements and computer models in 176 individual basins to make the determination.
""The mass loss is dominated by enhanced glacier flow in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface circumpolar deep water, including East Antarctica, which has been a major contributor over the entire period,"" a statement in the study said. ""The same sectors are likely to dominate sea-level rise from Antarctica in decades to come as enhanced polar westerlies push more circumpolar deep water toward the glaciers.""
ANCIENT ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET COLLAPSE COULD CAUSE A GLOBAL FLOOD
Since 2009, Antarctica has lost almost 278 billion tons (252 billion metric tons) of ice per year, the new study found. In the 1980s, it was losing 44 billion tons (40 billion metric tons) a year. ""During the entire period, the mass loss concentrated in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface, circumpolar deep water (CDW), that is, consistent with enhanced polar westerlies pushing CDW toward Antarctica to melt its floating ice shelves, destabilize the glaciers, and raise sea level,"" the study's abstract reads.
Eric Rignot, the lead author on the study, said the loss of ice in East Antarctica, an area that had been relatively stable, is exceptionally troubling. East Antarctica is losing 56 billion tons of ice a year, Rignot's study found. By contrast, last year's study found little or no loss in East Antarctica and had actually previously found gains, leading to the concern.
The melting in the area ""increases the risk of multiple meters (more than 10 feet) sea level rise over the next century or so,"" Rignot said. The melting seen in West Antarctica and the Antarctica Peninsula account for about four-fifths of the ice loss.
A number of studies have shown that global sea levels have risen approximately 8 inches over the past century, with sea-level rises getting higher in some parts of the globe. Coastal areas, such as Florida, Bangladesh and cities like London and Shanghai are at risk.
THESE WATER MOLECULES HAVE BEEN SITTING UNTOUCHED IN THE DEEP PACIFIC FOR 700 YEARS
In 2017, a study suggested that New York City could be in danger of getting hit with storms that occurred once every 500 years, every 5 years.
If global sea levels were to rise by 1.8 meters (nearly 6 feet) by 2100, that would be a ""worst-case scenario"" some scientists have forecast and could destroy the aforementioned coastal cities, along with many others and destroy homes to millions across the planet.
In December, a study presented by geologists suggested that if the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) melted, it could cause a massive global flood.
""Ice-sheet models link Pine Island glacier absence to full WAIS collapse into ice caps on mountains,"" the study's abstract read. ""Our record thus provides the first direct indication of a much smaller LIG WAIS, providing paleo-context for the susceptibility of the WAIS to collapse.""
“As the Antarctic ice sheet continues to melt away, we expect multi-meter sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries,” Rignot wrote in a statement accompanying his study and obtained by Reuters.
Another recent study also shed light on the startling rise in sea-levels and the effects climate change is having on the planet. The study said the amount of energy that has been put into the Earth's oceans over the past 150 years is the equivalent of an atomic bomb explosion every second for 150 years.
In September, NASA unveiled its new $1 billion satellite, ICESat-2, to give humanity a stronger, data-backed vision of exactly how fast Earth’s ice is melting.
According to the government space agency, melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has increased the global sea level more than a millimeter per year, which is a third of the overall increase.

"Experts have revealed the gruesome details of a 15th-century ritual sacrifice site in Peru that contains the remains of more than 140 children.
In a new study on the archaeological site at Huanchaquito-Las Llamas, archaeologists explain that the children’s hearts were apparently ripped from their bodies. The grisly location, which is near the UNESCO world heritage site of Chan Chan, is the largest known mass sacrifice site of children in the Americas, they say.
The remains of over 200 llamas, or possibly alpacas, were also discovered across an area spanning more than 7,000 square feet. “Cut marks transecting the sternums and displaced ribs suggest both the children and llamas may have had their chests cut open, possibly during ritual removal of the heart,” scientists explain, in a statement. Analysis of the human remains reveals that they were boys and girls aged between 5 and 14.

Radiocarbon dating indicates that the remains are from around 1450 A.D., a time when Huanchaquito-Las Llamas was part of the Chimu culture. “A thick layer of mud overlaying the burial sediments indicates that this mass killing was preceded, and perhaps inspired, by a major rainstorm or flood,” they explain in the statement.
Experts were stunned to find such a huge mass sacrifice site in northern coastal Peru, some 350 miles north of Lima.

""This archaeological discovery was a surprise to all of us — we had not seen anything like this before …” said Tulane University Anthropology Professor John Verano, who is one of the study’s authors, in a statement. “This site opens a new chapter on the practice of child sacrifice in the ancient world.""
The researchers note that the ritual sacrifice was “a large investment of resources for the Chimu culture” and hope to reveal more details about the sacrificed children.
Other grisly sacrificial sites have been revealing their secrets. A vast array of skulls buried beneath the streets of modern Mexico City, for example, have offered a chilling glimpse into Aztec human sacrifice.

With floods submerging expanses of the Midwest and government scientists warning that this spring could bring a historic flood season in the United States, its natural to ask why it is happening. What causes catastrophic flooding? And what is the role of climate change?
Each flood is its own phenomenon, tied to the specific circumstances in the area.
Flooding is complex, Deke Arndt, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Thursday in a briefing on the potentially dire flood season.
It has to do with precipitation falling to the ground, Mr. Arndt said, but also with the way that water is managed and the surface hydrology how it flows across the land and is collected and runs off.
The question of water management involves the building and maintenance of dams, levees, reservoirs and spillways. The surface hydrology part is about the landscape and how it affects the flow of water (for example, places rich in steep hills and valleys like Vermont can see severe destruction from intense rain events). And the development of housing, malls and other paved-over areas reduces the amount of open land that can absorb runoff.","Floods are complicated. But here are simple answers to questions about flooding, climate change and staying safe when the water rises.",2019-03-22T19:03:46Z,What Makes a Catastrophic Flood?

"(Reuters) - A shutdown of about a quarter of the U.S. government rolled into its 13th day on Thursday, with lawmakers and President Donald Trump divided over his demand for money for a border wall. 
The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is the 19th since the mid-1970s. Most have been brief. Trump’s latest is the third on the Republican president’s watch and already ranks among the longest ever. 
A border security briefing at the White House with senior lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon yielded no progress on reaching a deal to re-open the government. 
There were several very short shutdowns under Republican President Ronald Reagan. Under Democratic President Bill Clinton, there were two shutdowns, including the longest on record: 21 days in 1996. 
A 16-day shutdown happened under Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013 in a fight with Republicans over his healthcare law. 
The current shutdown has not affected three-quarters of the government, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, which have secure funding. But 800,000 employees from the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation and other agencies have been furloughed or are working without pay. 
Here is what is happening around the federal government. 
SMITHSONIAN 
The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo in Washington are closed due to the shutdown, according to the Smithsonian website. Among these is the popular National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016. “The museum is closed due to the federal government shutdown. Timed entry pass holders will be emailed instructions on how to reschedule their visit,” the museum posted on Instagram. 
HOMELAND SECURITY 
The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected. 
Of 245,000 agency employees, nearly 213,000 have been deemed “essential,” according to the department’s contingency plan, so they are working without pay until a funding bill is passed. TSA officers working without pay screened more than 2 million travelers and their baggage during the holidays. 
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) 
Most of this department’s 7,500 employees are “non-essential” and only about 340 are working. Nearly 1,000 others may be called in for specific tasks, without pay. 
Public housing authorities and Native American tribal housing entities are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down. But the federal government provides some of their funding so some have reduced services or changed operating hours. 
HUD, which oversees some housing loan and low-income housing payment programs, warned in its contingency plan that “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market.” 
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT 
The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau are not publishing economic data, including key figures on gross domestic product, inflation, personal income, spending, trade and new home sales, during the shutdown. 
OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
The agency that oversees the federal workforce has given advice to workers on dealing with landlords, mortgage lenders and other creditors, including sample letters explaining severe lost income due to the lack of federal funding. 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
The FCC, which regulates radio and television broadcast and cable systems, said it will suspend most operations at midday on Thursday, if the shutdown has not ended by then. Work for “the protection of life and property” will continue. So will operations at the agency’s Office of Inspector General, the FCC’s internal watchdog. 
COAST GUARD 
Members of the Coast Guard were due to get their final 2018 paychecks on Monday, their last until the government reopens. 
FEMA 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to resume issuing new flood insurance policies during the shutdown, reversing an earlier decision. 
INTERIOR 
The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, is operating with a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, some parks may be accessible, with others closed completely. The National Park Service is providing no visitor services such as restrooms, facility and road maintenance and trash collection. Campgrounds have begun closing due to sanitation issues. The parks are losing approximately $400,000 per day in usage fees because no rangers are staffing the entrances, according to Senate appropriators. 
TRANSPORTATION 
Of its 55,000 employees, 20,400 have been put on leave. This excludes most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 are working and the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources. 
Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations continue, but some rule-making, inspections and audits have been paused. 
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
An estimated 1,100 of the office’s 1,800 employees are on leave. This includes most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps implement budget and policy goals. 
NASA 
Most employees at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are on furlough. The small percentage of who remain - most deemed essential to “prevent imminent threats to human life or the protection of property” - are working without pay. Work on any satellite mission that has not yet launched will be suspended until the agency receives funding, according to its contingency plan. 
HOME PURCHASES 
Individuals trying to finance home purchases through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) are experiencing significant delays in loans being processed and approved, as are those applying to refinance an FHA-insured mortgage, according to Senate appropriators. 
MARRIAGES 
Some city government services in the District of Columbia also are affected by the shutdown. The courthouse offices that issue marriage licenses, for example, have closed. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has said she will sign emergency legislation to re-open the offices during the shutdown.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is expected to report on Monday that economic growth cooled to its slowest in 28 years in 2018 amid weakening domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, adding pressure on Beijing to roll out more support measures to avert a sharper slowdown. 
Growing signs of weakness in China which has generated nearly a third of global growth in the past decade are stoking worries about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from Apple to big carmakers. 
Chinese policymakers have pledged more support for the economy this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses, but they have ruled out a “flood” of stimulus like that which Beijing has unleashed in the past, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the world’s second-largest economy to have grown 6.4 percent in the October-December quarter from a year earlier, slowing from the previous quarter’s 6.5 percent pace and matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis. 
That could pull 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 6.6 percent, the lowest since 1990 and down from a revised 6.8 percent in 2017. 
With stimulus measures expected to take some time to kick in, most analysts believe conditions in China are likely to get worse before they get better, and see a further slowdown to 6.3 percent this year. Some analysts believe real growth levels are already much weaker than official data suggest. 
Even if China and the United States agree on a trade deal in current talks, which is a tall order, analysts said it would be no panacea for the sputtering Chinese economy unless Beijing can galvanize weak investment and consumer demand. 
Chen Xingdong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas, said investors should not expect the latest round of stimulus to produce similar results as during the 2008-09 global crisis, when Beijing’s huge spending package quickly boosted growth. 
“What China can really do this year is to prevent deflation, prevent a recession and a hard landing in the economy,” Chen said. 
On a quarterly basis, growth likely eased to 1.5 percent inOct-Dec from 1.6 percent in the preceding period. 
China will release its fourth-quarter and 2018 GDP data onMonday (0200 GMT), along with December factory output, retailsales and fixed-asset investment. 
Since China’s quarterly GDP readings tend to be unusually steady, most investors prefer to focus on recent trends. 
Surprising contractions in December trade data and factory activity gauges in recent weeks have suggested the economy cooled more quickly than expected at the end of 2018, leaving it on shakier footing at the start of the new year. 
Sources have told Reuters that Beijing was planning tolower its growth target to 6-6.5 percent this year from around6.5 percent in 2018. 
Tepid expansion in industrial output and weaker consumer spending is squeezing companies’ profit margins, discouraging fresh investment and raising the risk of higher job losses. 
Some factories in Guangdong - China’s export hub - have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long Lunar New Year holiday as the tariff war with the United States curtails orders. Others are suspending production lines and cutting back on workers’ hours. 
If the trade war drags on, some migrant workers may not have jobs to return to. 
Trade negotiators are facing an early March deadline and Washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of progress. 
STIMULUS STEPS EYED 
So far, Chinese policymakers have fast-tracked construction projects and cut taxes and some import duties to spur demand. 
To free up more funds for lending, particularly to more vulnerable smaller firms, the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves (RRR) five times over the past year, and guided borrowing costs lower. 
Workers inspect an electrical substation in Linyi, Shandong province, China January 17, 2019. Picture taken January 17, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer 
Further RRR reductions are expected in coming quarters, but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates just yet, as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize conditions. More forceful easing could pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels, with money going into less efficient or speculative investments. The government may unveil more fiscal stimulus measures during the annual parliament meeting in March, including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects, analysts say. 
Some China watchers believe the government could deliver 2 trillion yuan ($295.13 billion) worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year, and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects. 
Still, some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer.

"MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - European and Latin American leaders called for dialogue and elections to solve a deepening crisis in Venezuela on Thursday, warning against rash intervention in the country even as trucks bringing humanitarian aid lined up near the border. 
International pressure on Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down has intensified this week as a flood of EU members followed the U.S. move to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president of the economically shattered South American nation. 
Russia and China continue to back Maduro and have warned Washington and others not to intervene. 
Holding its inaugural meeting in Uruguay’s capital Montevideo, the European Union-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela called for a more hands-off approach than that advocated by the United States and some other Latin American nations. 
The group, in a communiqué after the meeting, said it would send a technical working group to Venezuela to push for elections as quickly as possible, adding that overly forceful intervention in the country could aggravate the crisis. 
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the group, launched late last month, was pushing for a peaceful and political solution, adding that a resolution ultimately must come from the people of Venezuela. 
“This is not only the most desirable result but is the only result if we want to avoid more suffering and a chaotic process,” Mogherini said in Montevideo alongside Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez. 
“The biggest dilemma facing Venezuela is between peace and war, which is why we are insisting in our call for calm from the parties involved and the prudence of the international community,” Vazquez said. 
The group’s communiqué said it would reconvene at the beginning of March to measure the progress of its plan. 
EU member states in the group include France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain. Latin America members include Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay. 
In power since 2013 and re-elected last year in a vote critics have called a sham, Maduro has presided over an economic collapse marked by widespread shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation. An estimated 3 million Venezuelans have left the oil-rich OPEC-member country. 
The first trucks carrying humanitarian aid meant to cross the border into Venezuela arrived on Thursday in the Colombian border city of Cucuta, where officials were to await instructions on how to distribute the food and medicine. 
Escorted by police motorcycles, the trucks pulled into the northern city, where desperate Venezuelans were waiting to see whether Maduro’s government would clear the border road he has blocked and allow the humanitarian shipments to pass. 
In Washington, Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special envoy on Venezuela, said President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing a ban on travel to the United States by members of Venezuela’s constituent assembly, a body controlled by Maduro and denounced by the opposition as illegitimate. 
Regarding aid being send to Venezuela’s border, Abrams said, “I don’t think we or the Colombians or the Brazilians or anyone else is planning to try to force it in.” 
GENERALS AND SOLDIERS 
Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup, has maintained power with the backing of Venezuela’s military, though the opposition leader has asked the military to side with the forces of democracy. 
In Washington, Navy Admiral Craig Faller, head of the U.S. military’s Southern Command, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the majority of Venezuela’s 2,000 generals were loyal to Maduro because of the wealth they amassed from drug trafficking and petroleum and business revenue. But Faller said rank-and-file soldiers were starving “just like the population.” 
“The legitimate government of President Guaido has offered amnesty, and a place for the military forces, most of which we think would be loyal to the constitution, not to a dictator, a place to go,” Faller told the hearing. 
Faller said the U.S. military is prepared to protect American personnel and diplomatic facilities in Venezuela if needed, though he did not provide any details. 
Guaido has galvanized the opposition since taking over as head of Venezuela’s National Assembly in January. Last month, he declared himself interim president, opening the door for Washington and others to recognize him as the legitimate leader. 
“Naturally I appeal to all of those who can help us ... to help put an end to this usurpation of a transition government, and bring truly free elections to Venezuela as soon as possible,” Guaido told the Sky24 television channel in Italy. 
The International Monetary Fund, which a new government in Caracas would likely call on for financial assistance, is awaiting guidance from its member countries on whether to recognize Guaido, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s conclusion that Donald Trump did not collude with Russia to win the presidency in 2016 gives the president a powerful weapon to use against his Democratic opponents and a potential boost to what is shaping up to be a tough bid for re-election in 2020. 
Mueller’s conclusion that neither Trump nor his aides conspired with Russia in 2016 takes away a central charge that Democrats have flung at Trump for two years - that he did not win the presidency fairly or cleanly. The allegations have played out on an endless loop on cable TV news shows, overshadowing Trump’s presidency from day one. 
Democrats have vowed to continue congressional investigations into the 2016 election campaign and Trump’s business practices. But without the solid foundation of a Mueller report that found evidence of any crimes by the president, they now risk seeming to overplay their hand. 
“This is a gold star day for Donald Trump,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “Now the shackles are off. He’s able to demonize the news media and Democrats as perpetuating what he calls a hoax. And he’ll be able to use his innocence as fodder for the campaign trail.” 
The question for Trump now is whether he will be able to bring a minimum of discipline to his campaign messaging and to the presidency itself. 
History suggests he will have trouble with self-discipline. Just last week, he was immersed in a strange fight with a dead man, sharply criticizing the late Republican Senator John McCain and falsely accusing him of being at the root of some of the collusion allegations against him. 
He has also been prone to making baffling abrupt decisions, such as occurred last week when he called off a round of sanctions against North Korea before they had even been imposed. 
Despite the Mueller report’s conclusions, Trump remains an intemperate president, eager to lash out at any and all critics and perceived slights. 
“This was an illegal takedown that failed,” Trump said on Sunday, even though Mueller left open the question of whether the former real estate magnate had attempted to obstruct the Russia probe, which did find extensive evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. 
“Now is the time to get back on the offense on the economy and growth,” said Republican strategist Scott Reed. “This is a good time to get back to a real healthy dose of message discipline for the entire administration, department-wide and the White House. That’s what you do when something like this happens.” 
Trump, on a golfing weekend in Palm Beach, Florida, got the news in his private quarters at his Mar-a-Lago retreat from White House counsel Emmett Flood, and watched TV coverage of the Mueller report in his cabin on Air Force One. 
Trump’s initial comments in reacting to the Mueller conclusion suggests he is not inclined to move past the investigation. 
Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One for the flight back to Washington, Trump called for Democrats to be investigated, expanding on his often repeated assertion that the Mueller probe was Democrat-inspired. Mueller was appointed by Trump’s Department of Justice in 2017 after he fired FBI director James Comey. 
“It’s a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest it’s a shame that your president has had to go through this,” Trump said. “Before I even got elected it began, and it began illegally.” 
Trump’s comments could foreshadow an effort by his supporters to seek payback for the cloud that has hung over his time in the White House. 
“I’m interested in moving on and trying to get this behind us, but people have to pay for what they’ve done for the past two years,” said former Trump campaign aide David Bossie. “We must investigate the investigators.” 
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump had no plans to request that his attorney general open an investigation into the president’s political opponents. 
CHALLENGES FOR DEMOCRATS 
Trump’s path to re-election remains a perilous one. Analysts say he will probably need to win the Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, just as he did in his improbable 2016 victory, and Democrats are already pouring resources into those states. 
Trump will foreshadow his campaign message on Thursday night when he headlines a “Make America Great Again” rally in Michigan. 
Trump supporters viewed the Mueller report as a blow to the more than a dozen Democrats who are campaigning for their party’s 2020 presidential nomination. 
“This is very problematic for any Democrat who’s running for president in 2020 that was hoping they would face a weakened or beaten-down President Trump,” former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller said. “In fact, President Trump will likely see a ratings boost coming out of this and a strong tailwind pushing him towards the upcoming election.” 
Reuters/Ipsos polling has shown that Americans decided early on in Mueller’s investigation whether they thought Trump was guilty of collusion or not. The polling found few undecided voters. 
Brinkley said Democrats will need to adjust their tactics and emphasize their differences with Trump’s record on issues ranging from healthcare and climate change to immigration. 
“Some of those charges are going to have to rise to be the main charges against Trump,” he said, noting there was fatigue with the Russia issue.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s central bank injected a record $83 billion into the country’s financial system on Wednesday, seeking to avoid a cash crunch that would put further pressure on the weakening economy. 
China’s policymakers are pledging to step up stimulus measures this year and do more to protect jobs as economic growth cools to 28-year lows. 
But a raft of measures last year from big rail projects to tax cuts seem to have had little impact so far, with recent data suggesting activity is cooling more quickly than expected. 
“The news is clear - the economy needs help,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia at Natixis in Hong Kong. 
Wednesday’s open-market operation, the bank’s largest net single-day injection on record, came a day after China’s state planner, central bank and finance ministry all offered reassurances to investors, signaling more spending and other types of policy support. 
But shockingly weak December trade data released earlier this week, along with shrinking factory activity, are stirring speculation over whether more rapid and aggressive policy measures are needed to turn the world’s second-largest economy around. 
Authorities now agree the economy needs more decisive support “and today’s large injection reflects that,” Nguyen added. 
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said Wednesday’s injection was aimed at ensuring there are ample funds in the financial system, which is facing strains as tax payments peak in mid-January, and as demand for cash picks up ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays starting in early February. 
“The banking system’s overall liquidity is falling rapidly,” it said in a statement. 
While sizable injections are common this time of year ahead of the long holidays, the addition was much heftier than usual and follows a large cut in banks’ reserve ratios announced this month, which will free up a total of $116 billion for new bank lending. 
The first stage, a 50-basis-point cut, came into effect on Tuesday. An equal-sized cut is scheduled for Jan. 25. 
The move also came a day after money supply data showed several of China’s key credit gauges continue to languish around record lows, despite government efforts to channel more funds to cash-starved companies and lower their financing costs. 
While authorities have urged banks to keep lending to struggling firms and even dangled incentives, banks are wary of bad loans after a long regulatory crackdown on riskier lending. 
Many businesses, facing slowing sales, are in no mood to make the fresh investments that Beijing is counting on. New medium- and long-term corporate loans last month fell to less than half of average December levels, Nomura noted. 
MORE HELP ON THE WAY 
Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged more support for the economy while vowing they will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus that Beijing has unleashed in the past, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt. 
Asked if the PBOC needed to cut benchmark interest rates, a PBOC deputy said on Tuesday that existing policy measures should be improved. 
Analysts at OCBC said the comments suggest the PBOC is willing to give existing measures time to work, and is in no rush to switch to more aggressive tactics at this point. 
“I have never seen such huge amounts of reverse repos ... the central bank is making its attitude known,” said a trader at a brokerage house in Shanghai. 
“It’s saying, ‘don’t question my determination’” to stabilize market expectations, the trader said. 
Markets appear to agree that policymakers will stick with modest measures for some time yet. 
Chinese stocks and money market rates, sensitive to hints of policy shifts, were little changed on Wednesday. The seven-day repo rate, CN7DRP=CFXS, a closely watched measure of liquidity, was 2.6142 percent on Wednesday afternoon, slightly lower than the previous day’s close. 
“While the (PBOC’s) net injection is big, it’s little versus what a rate cut would release, which is what people in the market are watching for,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho in Hong Kong. 
WEAKEST GROWTH IN 3 DECADES 
In a rare encouraging sign, home prices remained buoyant in December, suggesting that at least some of Beijing’s efforts at support are beginning to have an effect. Construction also appears to be slowly picking up as regulators fast-track approvals of more infrastructure projects. 
But analysts agree steps so far will take some time to percolate through the broader economy, with most not expecting activity to convincingly bottom out until summer. 
On Monday, China is expected to report the economy grew 6.6 percent in 2018, cooling from 6.9 percent the previous year and the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in 28 years. 
The pace is expected to slow further to around 6.2 percent this year. Some analysts’ in-house models suggesting activity is already much weaker than official data suggests.

Darkening the picture further, hopes are dimming once again that China will be able to reach a trade deal with the United States in current negotiations. U.S. tariffs have increasingly weighed on Chinese exports in recent months, disrupting its supply chains and dragging down business and consumer confidence. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week, Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the progressive populist who mounted a fierce challenge to front-runner Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House campaign, said on Tuesday he would again seek the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2020. 
Sanders, 77, announced his candidacy in a lengthy early morning email to supporters, pledging to build a vast grassroots movement to confront the special interests that he said dominate government and politics. 
“Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few,” Sanders said in the email, asking for 1 million people to sign up to start the effort. 
The senator from Vermont launched his insurgent 2016 candidacy against Clinton as a long shot, but ended up capturing 23 state nominating contests and pushing the party to the left, generating tension between its establishment and liberal wings that has not entirely abated. 
This time around, Sanders has been among the leaders in opinion polls of prospective 2020 candidates, but he faces a field more heavily populated with other liberal progressives touting many of the same ideas he brought into the party mainstream. That could make it harder to generate the same level of fervent support as four years ago. 
He also is likely to face questions about his age and relevance in a party that is increasingly advancing more diverse and fresh voices, including those of women and minorities - groups that Sanders struggled to win over in 2016. 
The primaries and caucuses that determine the party’s nominee begin in February 2020 in Iowa, and the Democratic winner is likely to face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November. 
Sanders has been an unsparing critic of Trump, and in his email he called him “the most dangerous president in modern American history.” 
“We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction,” Sanders said. 
‘COMPLETING THE REVOLUTION’ 
Among those already in the Democratic race are fellow Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. 
“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for,” Sanders said in his email to supporters. 
Sanders, a political independent and democratic socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, said he would push in his campaign for many of the same issues that powered his 2016 bid and resonated with younger voters, including universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage, and free public college tuition. 
“Three years have come and gone. And, as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans,” he said. 
A former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders won a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1990, making him the first independent elected to the House in 40 years. In 2006, he won a U.S. Senate seat and in 2018 was voted in for a third six-year term. 
His push against Clinton, a former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, was notable because few Democrats seemed inclined to challenge her claim on the nomination. Sanders’ candidacy swiftly became a phenomenon, as he spoke to swelling crowds and garnered passionate support on social media. 
Unlike Clinton, he refused to take money from corporate political action committees, or PACs, relying on a flood of small-dollar donations.

"At SAS Italian Records in Bensonhurt, a local fixture selling music and Italian trinkets, Silvana Conte, 62, said she had heard a million different things about the fines from fellow business owners, including rumors that the city was going to start requiring costly annual permits for signs. (The city denies this.) An adult day care center across the street had taken its awning down, and another neighbor had hired an architect. I wish the city would try and help out the small-business owners, Ms. Conte said. Its just impossible to survive. Down the street, Alexandr Choklin, 66, an assistant in a Chinese acupuncture and herb shop, shook his head when he was asked about its missing awning. It had once advertised the businesss services in English, Chinese and Russian. Were a small business, he said. We cannot afford a $6,000 fine. After hearing about fines from other businesses, Mr. Choklin asked his son to look up the regulations online. When it was unclear whether they might get a grace period to make sure the paperwork was in order, they decided to take the sign down. Who supports the city? Small businesses, Mr. Choklin said.

"NAAMAHBy Sarah Blake
The Old Testament has its own tale of ecological catastrophe in the story of Noah, instructed to save all species from a flood of waters upon the earth. Sarah Blakes debut novel, Naamah, puts Noahs wife at the center of a really very wild and superbly intelligent reimagining. (Lindsay Starcks 2016 novel, Noahs Wife, undertook another use of this material.) The pitfalls of biblical retellings are many they can be gushy, platitudinous or even cutely modernized but this one is not. It is set in an elemental agricultural past, on a flooded desert populated by angels, dead children and birds with the voice of God, and is written with a crafty poetic gleam.
It begins with a family on a boat. When someone dies and you forget how they look or how they laughed, that is how they forgot the land. Blake can invoke prodigious events in plain yet properly large terms. She is humbled by the Flood, but how long can someone reasonably be asked to experience humility? Theres an amused sanity under the gravitas.
Naamah (the name is mentioned in Genesis but only linked to Noah in the Midrash, the commentaries) has hard daily labor on the ark. She is the one patching a cage a walrus has gouged, attending a ewe giving birth and feeding a weak lamb to a restless tiger. (The descriptions of animal life are meticulous and terrific.) Noah is wise and pleasant, but hes often offstage.
When Naamah makes a rope swing to propel herself off the boat to swim, the novels more mysterious inventions appear. An angel underwater becomes a distinct and complicated character fleeing, beckoning, explaining, acting out desire. Theres quite a lot of sex in the story, some of it with Noah but most between females, its sequences and sensations vividly described. Naamah remembers that after her first childbirth, she told Noah how impressed she was with her body, and he was glad for her, but shed meant in the way one is impressed by God, with a measure of fear, a respectful distance. Female physicality is repeatedly evoked in this spirit.","In “Naamah,” an inventive first novel by Sarah Blake, Noah’s wife recounts the trials — and surprising pleasures — of life on the ark after the Flood.",2019-04-10T09:00:07Z,Fiction: A Modern Riff on an Old Testament Climate Catastrophe,The New York Times,0
"Every village in the vicinity of the two cities had been surrounded by floodwaters, while all five dams in Lorestan had reached capacity and four of them were overflowing.
Numerous rivers had burst their banks and landslides blocked many roads, said the reports. News outlets showed images of collapsed bridges and oil and gas pipelines destroyed by the flooding. The main railway line linking Tehran to the south of the country had also been blocked by the flood.
This is the third major flood to hit Iran in the past two weeks after heavy rainfalls in the mostly arid country, which had endured a prolonged drought until this year.
The first flood struck the northeast of the country on March 19 and the second hit the west and southwest on March 25, with a combined reported death toll of 45 people.
There was no immediate respite from the latest flooding, again striking the west and southwest, following heavy rain that was forecast to continue into Tuesday.
Aside from Lorestan, a half dozen other provinces are facing flood emergencies. Twenty-three of Irans 31 provinces have been affected and could face floods.
The reservoirs of many dams have reached full capacity, forcing emergency discharges, as much as 1,800 cubic meters per second in some cases, to prevent them from breaking.",The authorities ordered the evacuation of flood-ravaged cities in western Iran.

"SIDNEY, Iowa His farm is still cut off by floodwaters, so Iowa soybean farmer Pat Sheldon had to view the damage from the air. On a helicopter ride over what seemed like an endless stretch of water, he came to a place he recognized as his own land and saw that one of the grain silos had burst open, spilling yellow soybeans into the dingy, toxic water. 
It was like a punch in the gut, Sheldon said.
You work hard planting, taking care of these beans and harvesting them. Then, to have that happen makes you almost physically ill, he said. But I havent had time to get mad too many responsibilities and people that need still need help.
Although the water has yet to recede enough for a true examination, Sheldon says more than $350,000 of his corn and soybeans is in jeopardy, and he worries he may lose the farm thats been in his family for generations.
Before the terrible bomb cyclone sent warm rain down on frozen ground, resulting in catastrophic flooding throughout the Midwest and displacing thousands, American farmers were already struggling after several seasons of low commodity prices and the continuing trade war with China. In towns along the overflowing Mississippi and Missouri rivers, farmers are seeing their crops and their futures swept away by floodwaters.
In Nebraska, Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) has called the flooding the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our states history. Iowa has more than 100,000 acres of farmland still underwater. Officials from both states say the damage estimates are more than $1 billion and counting.
Its devastating for a lot of these folks, theres no doubt about it, said Jeff Jorgenson, a farmer and board member of the Iowa Soybean Association. Essentially, its two years of negative; these farmers lost what was stored in the bins and wont be able to plant next years crop. So its going to be really tough for a lot of people.
But, he added, if we get the opportunity, well go to work.
Some farmers had more soybeans in storage this year than normal, according to Frayne Olson, a crop economist and marketing specialist with North Dakota State University. The government estimates there are more than 3.7 billion bushels of soybeans still in storage a record partly because Chinese purchases of the grain have plummeted in recent months during the ongoing tariff war.
Iowa farmers have about 528 million bushels in storage, up 8 percent from the previous year, while Nebraska had 13 percent more grain stored, according to the U.S. Agriculture Departments estimate.
A lot of farmers have not been selling, hoping for better prices and some kind of trade agreement, Olson said.
As floodwaters are receding across some parts of the Midwest, new threats loom.
The Missouri River is continuing its destructive course south into Missouri where Gov. Mike Parson (R) declared a state of emergency, as governors have already done in Iowa, Wisconsin and hard-hit Nebraska.
The river is expected to crest this weekend in Atchison, Kan., and state officials urged residents of at-risk towns to evacuate.
Threats are emerging from the north over the next week, where warmer weather is causing snow to melt rapidly in the Dakotas and Minnesota, releasing vast quantities of water into streams and rivers, meaning some areas will have little chance to dry out before a new deluge arrives.
In Sioux Falls, S.D., the Big Sioux River is expected to have two crests one late Monday and another on Friday. The Mississippi will likely peak later in the week in St. Paul, Minn. Ten miles to the south, the city of Cottage Grove declared an emergency in anticipation of flooding from the river, which is expected to peak there on March 30.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned people to prepare for a prolonged disaster.
The stage is set for record flooding now through May, said Mary C. Erickson, deputy director of NOAAs National Weather Service. Edward Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center, called it potentially an unprecedented flood season.
There are some 40,000 soybean farmers in Iowa. In the past several years, 1 in 3 rows of soybeans have been sent to China, meaning farmers were heavily impacted after China virtually stopped buying American soybeans last year, according to the Iowa Soybean Association.
But some of the farmers who gathered Thursday at the Silver Spur Bar and Grill in Iowas Fremont County a population of about 7,400 didnt want to talk about tariffs, saying they felt their plight was being used to fuel political debate on cable news shows and by Washington.
We like what the presidents doing, Sheldon said. As the farmer sees it, weve had times a lot worse for grain prices as weve got right now. We know Chinas been screwing us for years, not only on farm products but on technology. We know we can duck our heads and pull our boots on and get through this, and, in the long run, the whole country is going to be better off.
The farmers said they were more concerned with the way the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was handling the management of the river. They said they received little warning from the Corps before levees breached and their land was flooded, and many did not have time to move their grain to safety.
Our story is that were devastated. Were faced with losing a whole years income, maybe two, said Brian Johnson, 57. Weve got a problem with the way the river is being managed. How are we going to recover? How can we keep our land and continue to farm?
The Army Corps of Engineers has long been criticized for a plan to control the Missouri River that farmers say prioritizes wildlife protection over flood control. A federal claims court judge ruled last year that Corps policies contributed to some flooding. After touring flood damage in Missouri last week, Parson said it was time to reevaluate the Corps management of the Missouri River.
A spokesman for the Corps office in Omaha did not return calls for comment.
Weve had no real communication from the Corps of Engineers since this started, said Mike Crecelius, the emergency management coordinator for Fremont County.
He estimates that there have been 14 breaches in their levees alone, causing $147 million in damage more than $100 million from farm crops and equipment.
Its been one big nightmare, he said.

"AMMAN (Reuters) - When a flash flood swept a group of schoolchildren to their deaths in Jordan last month, a wave of public criticism pointed to wider discontent within the kingdom. The backlash against the government on social media questioned how anyone had been allowed into an area at risk of seasonal flooding near the Dead Sea. Two ministers were sacked over the tragedy and King Abdullah ordered an inquiry. The reaction reflected the challenges facing a government struggling to win public support over a range of issues, chief amongst them tax increases needed to help plug the state’s gaping budget deficit. Criticism on Facebook and Twitter has been running at a high pitch all year with little or no respite even after King Abdullah replaced the government in June following a rare wave of protests over the economy. “Prison does not scare us and the word of justice we will say as long as we live. The country must get fixed,” political satirist Ahmed Hassan Zoubi tweeted on Nov. 17. King Abdullah’s half brother, former crown prince Hamza, has also weighed in, taking to Twitter in September to demand a crackdown on corruption in the public sector as a starting point for reform - a call voiced by the king himself. For Jordan, a U.S. ally whose stability has been a defining feature of the Middle East for decades, this has been an uncomfortable year. The government has been forced to cut spending and raise taxes, confronted by the economic impact of years of regional turmoil and diminished Gulf Arab support as a result of falling oil prices and the Yemen war. Adding to the pressures, Donald Trump’s proposed Middle East peace plan has hit a political nerve in Jordan, where millions of citizens of Palestinian refugee origin live alongside native Jordanians. Despite questions over whether the president’s “ultimate deal” will get anywhere, his approach has stirred old fears of any attempt to settle the conflict in a way that would suit Israel but forgo Palestinian rights at Jordan’s expense. With its stability underpinned by a powerful military and security apparatus, Jordan has developed one of the Arab world’s more open economies, investing in education and infrastructure including its gleaming airport and roads. A bulwark against Islamist militancy, Jordan has made peace with Israel and absorbed waves of Palestinian, Iraqi and Syrian refugees. It also navigated its way through the 2011 Arab Spring, though it still faces some of the issues that ignited regional turmoil that year, notably youth unemployment. Since the summer protests, there has been no sign of unrest in the streets. King Abdullah and his Hashemite dynasty enjoy solid support and act as a unifying force among native Jordanian tribes and Jordanian Palestinians. But not for the first time, the monarchy has come in for criticism of late. KING ABDULLAH STEPS INTO DEBATE In October, a group of retired senior military officers, tribal figures and activists from traditionally loyalist constituencies aired their grievances in a petition directed at King Abdullah. Attacking Trump’s Middle East policy, the signatories urged the king to stand firm against any moves that harm Jordan. The king subsequently announced he would not be renewing a deal that has let Israelis farm Jordanian land near the border since the peace treaty of 1994 - a move that won approval at home and was seen aimed at defusing some of the anger. The petition also included a call for the monarch to devolve more powers to parliament. “Loyalty is overwhelming in Jordan but that doesn’t mean there are no pockets here and there that are against even the monarchy. And they are negligible, yes, but through social media they will have a... big voice,” said Fayez Tarawneh, a pillar of the establishment who has served as prime minister and head of the royal court. With the traditional print and broadcast media loyal to the state and no organized opposition political parties, social media has become a channel for dissent. The government has launched a public awareness campaign on its dangers. “Fabricated news obstructs development and confuses public opinion,” declares one of the banners erected in recent days around Amman. King Abdullah has stepped into the debate about its role in unusually strong terms, taking aim at what he described as false rumors and stories spread online in a lengthy article published in pro-government media. Addressing speculation over a month-long absence this summer, the king criticized a “wave of rumors and false stories” that had spread concerning his annual break. “The question persisted: Where is the king? Some went as far as questioning my presence even as I stood before them.” “Unfortunately, some people have tried to spread rumors targeting the morale and unity of Jordanians,” he wrote. There was an urgent need, he wrote, to develop laws to ensure the protection of freedom of expression but also to “combat rumors and misinformation, and counter hate speech”. “Anyone who offends a Jordanian whether from my bigger Jordanian family or my immediate family offends me personally.” “NOT AN EASY RIDE” Amnesty International said the article appeared to signal the king’s support for proposed amendments to a cybercrimes law that would “deal a devastating blow to freedom of expression in Jordan”. The amendments were sent to parliament in September. “They are deeply scared of Facebook,” said Ali Braizat, a dissident from the town of Dhiban who has been jailed twice for opposition activities. Braizat, 55, is an unusually strident critic of King Abdullah, crossing red lines that allow criticism of the government but not the monarch. His town is one of the provincial tribal areas upon which the Hashemites built their support among native Jordanians. Many of its people have benefited from state jobs, including Braizat until he resigned in 2001. Jordan’s police chief is from the area. Braizat’s last spell in prison was in January, when he was held for one month. His arrest sparked protests in Dhiban. Braizat, a lawyer who also farms olives on family land in Dhiban, was a signatory of the petition, describing it as a “clear and frank” message to the king and his foreign backers. “The Jordanians are telling the king what’s requested of (him),” he said. “In the midst of what’s going on in the region we don’t want to change the regime. But (he is) the one in charge and responsible firstly and finally for changing things.” During the Arab Spring, there were protests in Dhiban but these were to demand more state jobs and services, not political reform, Braizat said. A visit by King Abdullah helped manage the situation. Jordan’s financial crunch now hangs over the state’s ability to finance jobs and services. Tarawaneh said the “financial squeeze” couldn’t be separated from regional instability. “What is needed really is continuous dialogue within the country to explain more... the procedures the government has to take. In certain areas, you need some surgery,” he said. “It’s not an easy ride.” Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Giles Elgood","When a flash flood swept a group of schoolchildren to their deaths in Jordan last month, a wave of public criticism pointed to wider discontent within the kingdom.",2018-11-26T11:59:48Z,Jordan faces wave of dissent as government's troubles mount,Reuters,0
"BEIRUT (Reuters) - At a makeshift camp in the Lebanese town of Arsal, refugees are burning their clothes trying to ward off the harsh cold as storms flood their tents. 
“We have no fuel at all. People are tearing up clothes, burning plastic, whatever they can find to get warm,” Abdallah Mokdeh said in the border town. 
“This is the worst we’ve seen in years.” 
Since 2011, more than a million Syrians have fled the war at home to Lebanon, where aid agencies say most live in severe poverty. Tens of thousands are in Arsal near the hills at the border with Syria. 
“The roads are blocked. We called an ambulance and it did not come,” said Mokdeh, a refugee who acts as a caretaker for the rows of tents pitched closely together on a patch of earth. 
Floods ruined mattresses and destroyed tents, forcing some people to move in with their neighbors. Many were sick or elderly. Some tents already housed three families, he said. 
“The snow, the cold have no mercy.” 
Mahmoud Hakouk, a 60-year-old Syrian man at the same site, has struggled to stay dry. “I need a blanket,” he said, shivering. “I swear to God I don’t have enough to buy bread.” 
The U.N. refugee agency said high winds, rain and snow had “heavily impacted” more than 150 informal settlements, including some that were fully flooded or collapsed. A child was reported missing, it said on Wednesday. 
The heavy storm inundated hundreds of tented settlements across Lebanon and left youngsters stranded in freezing temperatures, charity Save the Children said. 
“It’s miserable here, we have tents that collapsed because of the intense wind,” said Radwan Raad, standing in the snow at another ramshackle camp in Arsal. 
Many of the camp’s residents did not receive U.N. aid and could not afford food every day, he added. 
Helem Amer, 85, wrapped herself in a blanket in her flimsy shelter at that camp. “I can’t get up on my own, there’s no fuel, nothing, nobody to help.”

"A week after President Donald Trump forced Jeff Sessions to step down from heading the Justice Department and appointed Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, the DOJ has now authored a memo defending Whitaker's appointment as legal and constitutionally valid. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The high-level appointment of Whitaker -- a frequent critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe who was not confirmed by the Senate before joining the Justice Department last year as chief of staff to Sessions -- has prompted both Democrats and even some Republicans to cry foul. But in a memo Wednesday to White House counsel Emmet Flood, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel says, ""Mr. Whitaker's designation as Acting Attorney General accords with the plan terms of the Vacancies Reform Act,"" which states that when cabinet members and other senior government officials are ""unavailable"" to fulfill their duties, the president can appoint other government officials to temporarily serve in the positions if those replacements are sufficiently senior and have been employed by the government for at least 90 days. Speaking to reporters Wednesday on the condition of anonymity, a senior Justice Department official said the Justice Department provided the legal analysis at the behest of the White House -- but the official refused to say when the White House asked if appointing Whitaker would be constitutional. Further, the memo argues that Trump could appoint have appointed Whitaker whether Sessions voluntarily resigned or was explicitly fired by Trump. ""Doesn't that mean that, in theory, the president under your interpretation could fire anyone he wants and... just make anyone a Cabinet official?"" a reporter asked the Justice Department official. ""I don't want to address hypotheticals,"" the official responded, ""[but] it is correct that if the president terminates officials, that official is unavailable under the Vacancies Reform Act."" A lawsuit filed by the state of Maryland on Tuesday is challenging the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment, insisting the Constitution and U.S. law require that someone acting as attorney general and other ""principal"" positions be confirmed by the Senate. The memo written by the Justice Department says that previous administrations, including under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have similarly appointed non-Senate confirmed officials to positions that report directly to the president. However, asked whether someone not confirmed by the Senate has ever been appointed acting attorney general, the Justice Department official said, ""The best examples we found were in 1866"" -- four years before the Justice Department was created. The official would not say whether the Office of Legal Counsel has advised Whitaker over whether he should recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation.",Democrats and other critics argue his appointment is unconstitutional.,2018-11-14T16:21:04Z,"DOJ releases memo defending Whitaker's appointment as legal, constitutional",ABC News,0
"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)The new year brought a new game and new players to Washington: a fresh crop of Democrats who have made Congress younger, more ethnically and religiously diverse (""a huge win for Muslim feminism,"" wrote Rafia Zakaria), more female, more gay, more dance-happy and -- they insist -- more inclined to get things done on behalf of women, working people, immigrants and the environment. 
The Democrats, who now control the House and all of its investigative resources, may be the greatest challenge yet for President Donald Trump, who presides over a government that is partly shut down and an administration full of strife -- and already facing multiple investigations. 
""It's unclear whether Trump has grasped the full meaning of the new environment in Washington,"" Errol Louis pointed out. Impeachment or not, newly elected Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already ""let President Trump know that that his days of dominating the national political agenda with bluff, bluster and bullsh** have come to an end."" 
And though Pelosi didn't sign on to it, newly sworn-in Rep. Rashida Tlaib captured the mood of many progressives when she proclaimed on Thursday ""we're going to impeach the motherf****r.""
Her F-bomb made some Republican heads explode and upset some Democrats, but when pressed to make nice and apologize, Tlaib declined. ""Disgraceful,"" Trump complained. (Holly Figueroa O'Reilly countered on Twitter with a highlight reel of the President's expletives.) 
Four billion miles away, a NASA robotic probe was taking New Years' day pictures of the most distant celestial body any man-made object has ever reached.
Pelosi's opportunity and challenge 
David Gergen and James Piltch wrote that there's no denying Pelosi's central role ""in an unfolding drama"" that turns on one big question: ""Whether the flood of new women into Congress this year can begin the renewal of the badly broken political system that is increasingly holding back the country."" 
One problem facing Pelosi, warned Russell Berman and Elaine Godfrey in the Atlantic: The shutdown ""could sap much of the spotlight from the Democrats' policy agenda, muddling their opportunity to drive the national debate, at least on their own terms."" 
Even after that, Pelosi won't exactly be able to skate, wrote Scott Jennings. He recalled how the GOP's just-powerful-enough Freedom Caucus tormented her predecessors John Boehner and Paul Ryan, denying the ruling party the votes to pass a farm bill, raise the debt limit or fund the Homeland Security Department. Pelosi has it worse with her ""three-way split"" among a dwindling conservative wing, New Democrats...and progressives, who smell impeachment. And if that happens, it ""could easily backfire and cost her party dearly in 2020,"" Jennings said. 
Ocasio-Cortez's clap-back 
New York's freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez continues to drive her critics on the right crazy. How crazy? Someone tweeted out a dance video she made in college eight years ago, apparently hoping to humiliate her (""Here is America's favorite commie know-it-all...""). It went viral Wednesday, and tons of people found it ... delightful. ""Well, @AOC is officially done. She'll never recover from the world seeing her... (watches video) ...dancing adorably and having fun with her friends...?"" tweeted Patton Oswalt. Then Ocasio-Cortez clapped back with a cheerful video of her dancing outside her new congressional office. ""I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,"" she tweeted. 
Virginia Heffernan, in the Los Angeles Times, welcomed the new dynamic that has women like Ocasio-Cortez using social media to run rings around terrified men. ""By turning up the volume on the Republicans' terrified sexism, as a digital native does best, she's made quick work of her haters."" 
Republicans are making a mistake here, argued Julian Zelizer. ""By vilifying Ocasio-Cortez, the GOP is helping to turn her into one of the political superstars of 2019. They are giving her more time in the spotlight and unifying Democrats around someone who does come from a left-of-center perspective,"" and is pushing, for example, a Green New Deal. 
Here comes Elizabeth Warren
The Democratic senator from Massachusetts announced via video that she was forming an exploratory committee for the presidency. ""A brilliant beginning,"" Jill Filipovic cheered. ""Warren has done us all an immense favor"" by setting up the race and ""insisting it focuses on class and race, economic inequality and gender inequality."" 
In the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin warned that Warren is a ""less formidable candidate than she was a year ago."" She ""at times hectors rather than inspires, sounding more like an activist/law professor than a compelling leader,"" and flubbed her DNA-test response to Trump's ""Pocahantas"" jabs, offending Democrats and others, Rubin wrote. 
David Axelrod served in the White House when Warren, as a House counsel, ""was pummeling Treasury officials over treatment of Wall Street executives who were culpable in the financial crisis."" Some may find her ""edgy and dogmatic vision of capitalism"" off-putting, he wrote. But ""the cause of the embattled middle class is a natural one"" for her, a janitor's daughter lifted by her intelligence and tenacity ""from modest beginnings to this moment. These are indispensable qualities any winning candidate for president of the United States must own."" 
Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, faced allegations that there was sexism and harassment in his 2016 campaign. Sally Kohn found his apology on Anderson Cooper's show, in which he cited his campaign's ""gold standard"" for principles, defensive and totally inadequate. ""The gold standard is taking responsibility for the culture you as a leader create and doing everything in your power, rhetorically and otherwise, to root out toxicity within it."" 
I'm a Brit, and America, your health care system is torturing me.
How do you stand it? asked Rob Crilly, who recently tried to get his bum knee fixed in America and found dealing with insurers and doctors' offices and New York's Obamacare exchange like entering a maze from Kafka. ""What no one had briefed me on was the sheer bewildering complexity of it all,"" he wrote. ""So, what is the solution? Medicare for all, which progressives are pushing, sounds like a possibility. Maybe it could work, like it does in Britain."" 
The Nixon letter he couldn't forget
Memory is a slippery thing. CNN's Michael Smerconish thought he recalled vividly seeing a 1987 letter from Richard Nixon to Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo right after Rizzo lost re-election. Nixon wrote: ""Dear Frank: I have learned that when you win you hear from everybody; when you lose you hear from your friends. Count me in the latter category."" Or did he? Smerconish tried to get the letter as a memento after Rizzo's widow died. What he learned took him down a rabbit hole of recollection and Nixonian etiquette. It's a good yarn. 
What the Navy kiss backlash is really about. 
A TV station in Jacksonville, Florida, drew complaints after it aired video of a returning sailor kissing his husband at dockside a re-enactment of Alfred Eisenstaedt's Times Square photo from V-J Day in 1945. The reaction troubled Danielle Campoamor, who lamented our ""collective ability to overlook the facts."" She noted that the Eisenstaedt photo might well have documented a sexual assault (the nurse in the photo, according to some reports, did not know the sailor who grabbed her). ""If only people were outraged over a picture of a man forcibly kissing a woman and not a husband lovingly kissing his husband."" 
Just 33 minutes after puny earthlings cheered the dawning of a new year (ET) this week, something actually incredible happened deep in outer space: NASA's New Horizon probe zoomed at 32,000 mph by Ultima Thule, a big frozen, snowman-shaped object left over from the primordial solar system, snapping pictures the whole time. It is ""the most distant astronomical body ever investigated,"" marveled Don Lincoln, a senior physicist at FermiLab. Brian May the guitarist for Queen and an astrophysicist -- even wrote a song about it.
Call it a triumph of robotics, which have let humans slip ""the shackles of the inner solar system and, as the famed television show said, gone where no one has gone before,"" said Lincoln. ""The impulse to explore seems to be hardwired in what it means to be human...With space, we're just getting started.""
Gilbert Gottfried: Bob Einstein viciously insulted me...and I never laughed so hard. 
He was Super Dave, the deadpan and hilarious fake stuntman who would show up in his jumpsuit on Letterman or Conan every so often, and he was Marty Funkhouser on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" And to comedian Gilbert Gottfried, Bob Einstein who died Wednesday was one of the funniest guys he'd ever hosted on his podcast.

"Heavy rain is forecast in parts of California on Wednesday, potentially triggering flash floods, debris flows or mudslides in areas where wildfires recently killed more than 80 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. At least 870 people still were unaccounted in the wake of wildfires that have scorched nearly 400 square miles of land across the Golden State, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Brian Ferreira, a rescue squad officer for California Task Force 4, said the heavy rain could wash away potential ""remains, or cremains,"" and impede the search for victims. His team and other rescue crews across the state are racing to get as much done as possible before rain starts falling later today, likely continuing the next few days. A burned neighborhood is seen from above in Paradise, Calif., Nov.15, 2018. ""When the rain comes, [it's] going to consolidate the material and make it more dense and pack it down. And it's going to present much more like soil,"" Ferreira told reporters on the ground Wednesday. ""So anything we find or hope to find that's still there, it's gonna make a difficult task just that much more difficult."" ""We're going to go as hard as we can, as long as we can, until we can't go anymore,"" he added. ""That's what's going to happen."" The worst of the rain systems could hit Paradise, a town virtually wiped out by wildfire, with as much as 5 inches of rain through Friday. The rain is good news, overall, according to meteorologists, because it will boost air quality and lower the risk of new fires igniting this winter, but it likely will bring isolated mudslides and flash flooding to areas devastated by wildfires.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a leading advocate of the Trump administrations renewed sanctions on Iran, rejected the Iranian assertions in a statement posted on the State Department website.
These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness, Mr. Pompeo said. The regime blames outside entities when, in fact, it is their mismanagement that has led to this disaster.
He said the United States stood ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief.
The administration has said the sanctions are not intended to hurt ordinary Iranians. But many foreign banks and other businesses are now reluctant to deal with Iran, partly over fears of inadvertently violating American prohibitions.
Iranians have complained that the sanctions have made it difficult if not impossible to obtain imported medicines, for example.
The floods have emerged as a new political and economic liability for President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who has been under increased pressure for having negotiated the nuclear agreement renounced by Mr. Trump.

"A storm in the eastern U.S. is bringing mainly heavy rain to half of the nation this weekend. On Friday, over 2 inches of rain fell in parts of South Carolina, with flooding reported there and some minor flooding reported in parts of Florida as well. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The radar is showing several areas of very heavy rain Saturday morning from Missouri to Washington, D.C., and south to Florida. Heavy rain, and in some locations a melting snow pack, could cause some flooding through the weekend. Rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will be possible. Flood alerts have been issued for a large part of the East Coast, including Raleigh, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. Rain is covering much of the eastern half of the U.S. on Saturday morning. The storm is a slow mover, which could enhance rainfall totals in some spots. By Sunday morning, rain will still be falling in parts of the Northeast. However, rain moving into parts of interior New England could mix with or transition to snow during the morning hours. Little to no accumulation is expected, but some slick spots are possible in the interior Northeast on Sunday morning. By Sunday morning, rain will be centered over the Northeast. By Monday morning, colder air wrapping around the storm should bring a quick round of snow to parts of the interior Northeast again. It is likely that accumulations will be very limited with the best chances for accumulation located in the higher elevations south of Albany, New York. The storm will be moving off the Northeast coast by Monday, but delivering some trailing snow to northern New England. The other notable mention with this system is that this latest storm is bringing more rain to a region of the country that is already breaking annual records. Heavy rain is falling in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Saturday morning, which has already observed its wettest year on record. As of 11 p.m. Friday, Wilmington had received 99.68 inches of rain in 2018. A large amount of this rainfall came from Hurricane Florence in September. The previous record was 83.65 inches in 1877. Washington, D.C., is also seeing heavy rain Saturday morning. The city has already seen 61.06 inches of rain in 2018, making it the second-wettest year on record. With another 1 to 2 inches of rain forecast, D.C. will almost certainly break the annual record of 61.33 inches set in 1889. Rainfall totals in the mid-Atlantic will be in the 1 to 2 inch range through Monday. Strong winds on Friday night caused over 100,000 power outages in northwest Washington, some of those in the Seattle area. Wind were reported to be close to 50 mph at times. Behind the gusty winds, a storm is moving into the Northwest by Saturday night which will bring mainly heavy rain and some mountain snow. The heavy rain will stretch down to parts of California as well. Heavy rain will move onto the West Coast by Sunday morning. Another low is lurking right behind this system that will bring the next round of rain to the region for Tuesday and Wednesday. Some flooding is possible in parts of the West with this second system. Rainfall totals in parts of the western U.S. through Wednesday could exceed 5 to 6 inches. However, much of the Pacific Northwest is used to seeing rainfall in this fashion during the colder months.

"A major storm that dumped over 10 inches of snow on Lubbock, Texas, on Saturday is moving into the Southeast on Sunday with heavy rain on the southern side and as much as a foot of snow in western North Carolina and Virginia. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The very heavy snow is already impacting North Carolina and Virginia on Sunday morning. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are being reported in parts of western North Carolina and southern Virginia. Freezing rain is also falling in parts of central North Carolina at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per hour. In the mountains of western North Carolina, near Rosman, 13 inches of snow had already been reported Sunday morning. Waynesville, North Carolina, had seen 9 inches of snow as of 5 a.m., while Gatlinburg, Tennessee, received 7 inches. The same storm brought 7.96 inches of rain to parts of Texas, and over 6 inches of rain to parts of Louisiana. Storm alerts cover the Southeast on Sunday due to a major storm moving through. Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings have been issued from central Arkansas to Maryland. Flood watches have been issued for parts of Georgia, Florida and Alabama due to the heavy rain. The radar on Sunday morning was showing a large swath of precipitation, in a classic comma-shaped pattern, from Arkansas to Virginia. Hourly rainfall rates of 2 inches per hour are possible in the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia Sunday morning. Heavy snow was falling in North Carolina and southern Virginia on Sunday morning, while Georgia and South Carolina received heavy rain. The brunt of this storm will be felt during the first half of Sunday with very heavy snow in North Carolina and Virginia. The storm will try to nudge north into the mid-Atlantic later on Sunday, however, a high-pressure system bringing cold air to the Northeast should stop the storms northward progression. However, snow is now forecast to reach well into parts of Virginia and possibly even parts of Maryland before the end of the day. Strong thunderstorms and heavy rain will continue in parts of Florida and Georgia Sunday evening as a cold front interacts with a relatively warmer, moist air mass. Some coastal flooding is possible Sunday along the southeast coastline due to onshore winds. This will be especially problematic in parts of the Charleston, South Carolina, area. The storm will move out into the Atlantic by Sunday evening, delivering just some remnant snow to North Carolina and Virginia. The storm will slide into the Atlantic Ocean by Monday morning, with only a few snow showers remaining. Widespread snowfall totals over 1 foot are likely across much of western North Carolina and into Virginia. The snowfall totals have been nudged slightly up Sunday morning, with a little bit more of the heavy snow reaching Richmond and Harrisonburg, Virginia. The storm should stay south of Washington, D.C. Major cities in North Carolina and Virginia will see significant weather impacts Sunday, including Raleigh, Greensboro, Roanoke and Richmond. Travel will be nearly impossible at times. A wide swath of western Carolina and western Virginia could see 6 to 12 inches of snow or more through the weekend. Meanwhile, it is quite cold across parts of the northern U.S., most notably in the Northeast where wind chills are dropping into the lower 20s and teens. While the cold air is uncomfortable, it is the same air mass that is preventing the major snowstorm from traveling up the coast and causing major impact to I-95 cities. Bitterly cold air is in place across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday, but it is also blocking the storm from moving north.",Parts of western North Carolina and Virginia are preparing for major snow.,2018-12-09T11:18:42Z,"North Carolina, Virginia could see 1 foot of snow from major winter storm",ABC News,1

The storm dumped over 17 inches of snow in the mountains of Colorado, and widespread 2 to 4 inches of snow from the Colorado Plains to the upper Midwest. Freezing rain also was reported in parts of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana on Tuesday night.
Locally heavy snow is moving through parts of the Midwest, including Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Wednesday morning. In Chicago, a wintry mix, with some snow, is possible as colder air is being wrapped into the storm. However, most of the frozen precipitation will stay north and west of the city. A dangerous morning commute is likely in these areas.
Additionally, a wintry mix is likely across parts New York state Wednesday morning as precipitation is interacting with colder air.
A line of severe storms and heavy snow stretches from Texas to Michigan on Wednesday morning.
There are numerous alerts being issued for this wide-ranging storm, including winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories from Kansas to Michigan to Maine. Since there is a threat for heavy rain in the Northeast, there are new flood watches being issued for the major cities, including New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Additionally, there are alerts being issued for blowing snow in the Northern Plains in the storms wake.
A line of very heavy rain will extend through the Mississippi and Tennessee Valley late in the day Wednesday. Additionally, severe weather is likely across parts of the Gulf -- from New Orleans to Mobile -- where damaging winds and brief tornadoes are possible. Since this cold front is very strong, it will also cause gusty winds over 35 mph in spots.
Severe storms will move into Alabama and Georgia later in the day Wednesday.
Out ahead of the cold front, very mild air will surge up the East Coast. Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average in the New York City area, where temperatures might be in the mid-50s Thursday morning. But the warmth will be brief.
Early Thursday morning, the heavy rain and strong winds will move into the southeast U.S. and toward Atlanta. By Thursday morning, the line of heavy rain, with some locally strong thunderstorms, will stretch along the entire East Coast. Very heavy rain will fall Thursday during morning rush hour in the major northeast cities. Locally, 1 to 2 inches of rain could cause flash flooding and strong gusty winds are possible.
The East Coast will feel the effects of the storm on Thursday morning.
An additional complication in parts of the Northeast is that the heavy rain, combined with mild temperatures, will cause last week's snow to rapidly melt and cause additional flooding concerns.
Behind this storm, another frontal system will pass and deliver a cold blast. Wind chills on Friday in the Midwest will dip locally to minus 30 degrees. Chicago will feel like minus 21 on Friday morning.
Wind chills will dip well below zero in the Northern Plains on Friday morning.
Some of this cold air makes its way east, but moderates before reaching the major Northeast cities. It will not be as cold as last weekend.

The White House team of lawyers, according to sources, will cooperate when its deemed a request from Congress is valid however, in the cases when its not in the legal teams opinion they will fight that aggressively and would potentially invoke executive privilege or claim an active investigation.

Cummings has no illusions about the White House likely legal strategy and potential resistance to congressional oversight requests but said it's important for both sides to work together. He set a deadline last Friday for the White House to respond to dozens of requests for information but has not commented on next steps or the White House's compliance with those inquiries.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Let the 2020 White House race begin. Tuesday’s elections sounded the starting gun for a long, crowded, expensive and no doubt dramatic race for the presidency. Democrats, riding a wave of momentum from their gains in the U.S. House of Representatives, enter the presidential cycle without a clear front-runner for the first time since the start of the 2004 campaign. More than two dozen possible contenders, including former Vice President Joe Biden and a gaggle of senators, governors, mayors and business leaders, have been jockeying for months to line up donors and evaluate their shot at the party’s nomination. Awaiting the winner will almost certainly be President Donald Trump, a Republican whose approval ratings have been mostly stuck below 50 percent since he took office but whose popularity within his party will make any potential challenge from another Republican the longest of longshots. Trump loomed over Tuesday’s midterm elections, fueling turnout among Democrats eager to reject him and driving many Republican candidates to pledge support for him or else face a backlash from their conservative base. Democrats are already wrestling with questions about which candidate, strategy and approach are most likely to beat Trump on Nov. 3, 2020. Many Democrats are expected to jump in the race early, within the next few months. Whoever emerges from the grueling state-by-state Democratic nominating process, which kicks off in Iowa in early 2020, will have to stand up to the pugilistic Trump while developing an appealing alternative agenda and uniting the party’s sometimes feuding progressive and establishment wings, Democrats said. “There will be a lot for Democrats to work through this time,” said Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 run. “It’s not just finding the person who can beat Trump, but also the person who has a vision for unifying the country.” ENCOURAGING SIGNS Democrats said the midterm campaign offered plenty of encouraging signs for the 2020 race, as grassroots enthusiasm to resist Trump led to a new majority in the House of Representatives, a flood of first-time candidates up and down state ballots and an explosion of left-leaning advocacy groups and grassroots protests. Even the losing campaigns of unabashed liberals Andrew Gillum, who lost his bid to be the first African-American governor of the swing state of Florida, and Beto O’Rourke, who became a grassroots sensation but fell short in his U.S. Senate bid in conservative Texas, offered lessons on how to run strong races on Trump-friendly turf, Democrats said. “The model for 2020 is Andrew Gillum and Beto O’Rourke. The nominee is going to have to produce large-scale grassroots support and go everywhere and reach out to everybody,” said Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress. The midterm campaign showed the power of Trump and the #MeToo movement to motivate women, sparking an unprecedented number of female candidates and encouragement for women considering a 2020 run such as Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar. “We have a whole universe of suburban women and voters under 40 who are so ticked off at Trump they are coming out to vote in droves and energizing the base organically,” said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster for both Clinton and former President Barack Obama. The Democratic contenders will have to navigate the struggle between the party’s establishment and progressive wings that flared during the 2016 primary between Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with several candidates expected to test how far to the left they can run and still win a national election. ‘THAT’S THE TRICK’ “That’s going to be the trick in 2020 - can you be the person who puts that coalition together and holds it?” said U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, one of the dozens of Democrats pondering a possible White House run. “We need to think about how we reassemble a new progressive coalition that pulls in independents and moderate Republicans and independent women and working class people, and makes it a coalition we can sustain for a decade,” Ryan said. Sanders, who is considering another presidential bid, pushed the party and Clinton to the left in 2016 on signature issues such as universal healthcare, a $15 minimum wage and free tuition at public colleges. The most successful Democrats during the midterms were able to talk about checking Trump while also offering an alternative liberal vision, Democrats said. “Figuring out who can thread that needle is going to be a key part of the Democratic primary process,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the progressive Democracy for America political action group. The crowded Democratic field, which could be bigger than the 17 Republicans who ran in 2016, could have plenty of familiar faces such as Biden, Warren and Sanders - ages 75, 69, and 77 respectively. It also should have plenty of less known contenders such as Governor Steve Bullock of Montana, former governors Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and New Orleans’ former mayor, Mitch Landrieu. THE RACE STARTS EARLY With such a sprawling field, many candidates are expected to jump in early. Only one Democrat, little known U.S. Representative John Delaney of Maryland, has formally announced a bid so far. Trump, who filed for re-election the day he was inaugurated, is primed for the fight. He has taken to belittling potential Democratic rivals during his frequent political rallies to support Republican candidates, and has been building his supporter lists for nearly two years. He already has a campaign slogan, “Keep America Great” - following “Make America Great Again” in 2016 - and has raised $106 million for re-election, financial reports show. He is unlikely to face a serious Republican primary challenge, and any longshot bid would be a largely symbolic one from the party’s narrow anti-Trump wing, led by Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in 2016, and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Both are frequent Trump critics who are leaving office. “I would seriously doubt” there will be a challenge to Trump, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said, adding Republicans feel good about their political standing. “From a right of center point of view, it doesn’t get any better than this Congress. And I think the president has many things to feel good about,” McConnell said. Democrats have no illusions about the race. Trump has repeatedly shown his ability to dominate opponents and turn controversies into rallying cries for his base. The 2020 campaign will be Trump’s first time on a ballot since his shocking 2016 upset of Clinton, when he used his fame as a businessman and former reality TV star with no experience in elected office to cast himself as the change candidate who would smash the status quo. This time, Democrats say they must be the agents of change. “If we are in a race where voters are deciding between Trump and someone who is defending the Obama years, we’ll be in trouble,” Tanden said.

"The USS San Diego was the only major warship the U.S. lost during World War I. Now, nearly 100 years after it sank, and countless theories as to what caused the wreck, researchers believe they have determined the cause of it — a German U-boat in conjunction with a mine. Presenting the theory at the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) fall meeting, Dr. Alexis Catsambis said new survey data – based on additional research into archives, computer impact, flood models and surveying the area of the ocean floor where it lays – all point toward the Germans. “The legacy of the incident is that six men lost their lives on July 18, 1918,” said Catsambis in a statement obtained by Fox News. “With this project we had an opportunity to set the story straight and by doing so, honor their memory and also validate the fact that the men onboard did everything right in the lead up to the attack as well as in the response. The fact that we lost six men out of upwards of 1100 is a testament to how well they responded to the attack.” REMAINS OF US REVOLUTIONARY WAR FRIGATE DISCOVERED OFF UK COAST The 500-foot armored cruiser, which had 1,177 crewmembers, sank approximately 8 miles from Fire Island, New York, in just 28 minutes. It is believed the German U-boat U-156 was responsible for the sinking. The USS San Diego still resides largely intact in approximately 115 feet of water, albeit upside down, Live Science reports.

Note two-star Rear Admiral's flag flying from her mainmast top. U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command Photograph.

"The mass extinction event that killed the dinosaurs is commonly thought to have been triggered by a massive asteroid that struck the Earth 66 million years ago. However, a pair of new studies believe that a huge volcanic eruption may have also played a role in the dino demise.
Both studies, published in Science, look at the connection between the impact on the Yucatan Penninsula in Mexico which may have triggered volcanic eruptions in India. In one paper, they were able to determine precise dates for the eruptions, noting the ""million-year sequence of eruptions"" sent lava hundreds of miles across India, creating the Deccan Traps flood basalts.
""Now that we have dated Deccan Traps lava flows in more and different locations, we see that the transition seems to be the same everywhere,""  UC Berkely Professor-in-residence Paul Renne, in a statement. ""I would say, with pretty high confidence, that the eruptions occurred within 50,000 years, and maybe 30,000 years, of the impact, which means they were synchronous within the margin of error.""
ASTEROID THAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS CAUSED A MILE-HIGH TSUNAMI AROUND THE EARTH
""That is an important validation of the hypothesis that the impact renewed lava flows,"" Renne added.

Perhaps even more startling is that three-quarters of the lava flow erupted after the impact, whereas previous studies said about 80 percent of the lava came before the impact.
The researchers were able to use the argon-argon dating method to measure the rocks to determine when the rocks were from, building off previous research. Using the new method, they were able to pinpoint a date of 66,052,000 years ago, ""give or take 8,000 years.""

Assuming the majority of the lava came out after impact, the gases that entered the atmosphere likely trickled out for a lengthy period of time, similar to what is seen with Mt. Etna in Italy and Popocatepetl in Mexico.
""We are suggesting that it is very likely that a lot of the gases that come from magma systems precede eruptions; they don't necessarily correlate with eruptions,"" Renne said. In the case of the K-Pg extinction, the symptoms of significant climate change occurred before the peak in volcanic eruptions.
THE DINOSAURS DIED A COLD, DARK DEATH, NEW STUDY SHOWS
Courtney Sprain, the lead author on one of the studies, said the findings change the role the Deccan Traps had in the K-Pg extinction, also known as the extinction that occurred at the end of the Cretaceous Period.
""Either the Deccan eruptions did not play a role — which we think unlikely — or a lot of climate-modifying gases were erupted during the lowest volume pulse of the eruptions,"" Sprain said in the same statement.
A study published in January said the impact of the asteroid caused a worldwide tsunami that reached more than 5,000 feet in the air.

"LOS ANGELES -- California’s rainy season could be the wettest in 40 years, but experts say the state is missing a major opportunity by failing to collect the trillions of gallons of storm runoff that currently flows wastefully into the ocean.
“We will never capture it all, but we need to do a better job of capturing what we can,” said Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute.
In February alone, an estimated 18 trillion gallons of water fell on the state. In urban areas and coastal cities, 80 percent ends up diverted into the ocean, as Los Angeles and other cities built long concrete channels for flood control. The Los Angeles River, for example, is a 51-mile-long canal as wide as a football field. Almost none of the water seeps into the underground aquifer.
“The challenge is: How do we capture more of that water to use it so we can use it during dry parts of the year? And cities in California have not historically done a good job of capturing what we call stormwater,” said Gleick, who helped author a study showing how San Francisco and Los Angeles could harness nearly as much water as they consume.
CALIFORNIA WATER BELOW NORMAL IN SEASON'S FIRST SNOW SURVEY
In the past, the state relied on a vast network of nearly 50 dams and reservoirs to capture and bank snowpack from the Sierra Mountains. Snow that melted in the spring and summer was pumped south into the Central Valley for growing and to serve thirsty cities till the rainy season begins in December.
For years, the system worked seamlessly, providing for economic growth and agricultural expansion. But the last dam built in California was 40 years ago. Since then, the population doubled.
The state handled previous droughts in 1976 and 1988. But the last five-year drought, from 2011 to 2015, brought a 25 percent mandatory reduction. Crops died, farmers went out of business and then-Gov. Jerry Brown proposed fining residents $10,000 a day for wasting water.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Suddenly the state realized it needed a new approach. Voters approved $2.7 million in bonds for new water storage projects. The first of those, however, is still five years away from completion – and many won’t be done until 2030 or beyond, leaving the state vulnerable to the next drought.
“As Californians, we have to pull together and save water in every way we can,” Brown said at the time.
Two months ago, in his State of the State address, new Gov. Gavin Newsom said: “Our water supply is becoming less reliable because of climate change.”
Experts predict longer droughts and more floods. Yet, the state turned down an offer from the Trump Administration to raise Shasta Dam, providing 14 percent more water for California.
WINTER STORMS WASH AWAY CALIFORNIA DROUGHT, BURNISH SNOWPACK
This past weekend, even former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson weighed in on the debate, telling the Los Angeles Times that he tried to build more dams in the 90s, but “Democratic majorities in the Legislature (and) no growth advocates in Washington and Sacramento (stopped him) given the signal surface collection was not politically in season.”
Now it is. Besides conservation, California and local water departments are planning multiple stormwater-capture plans.
“There is still a debate in California about the value of building new concrete infrastructure like new dams,” Gleick said. “If we can find decent places to build them or raising Shasta, for example, vs. cutting demand or being more efficient.”","California’s rainy season could be the wettest in 40 years, but experts say the state is missing a major opportunity by failing to collect the trillions of gallons of storm runoff that currently flows wastefully into the ocean.",2019-03-06T21:44:53Z,"Despite California’s long drought, trillions of gallons of rainwater wastefully flowing into sea",Fox News,0
"DUBAI (Reuters) - Authorities in Iran worked on Saturday to evacuate villages threatened by flooding in southwestern areas as forecasters predicted more of the heavy rains that have killed at least 45 people this week, state media reported. 
State television said at least 11 villages lying near the Dez and Karkheh rivers in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan were being evacuated as officials released water from two major dams along the rivers due to forecasts for more rain. 
Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian, who is in charge of water resources, said authorities were working round-the-clock to “control floodwaters and to minimize possible damage”. 
“It’s estimated that in the next five days about three billion cubic meters of water will flow into dam reservoirs in Khuzestan due to rainfall ... 1.8 billion of which (is above capacity and) will have to be released,” he told state television. 
Government officials have said no cities will have to be evacuated but that damage to villages and farms near rivers is likely, vowing to compensate farmers for the loss of crops or livestock. 
At least 45 people were killed earlier this week in flash floods in northern and southern Iran after the heaviest rains recorded in Iran in at least a decade, the state news agency IRNA quoted Health Minister Saeid Namaki as saying. 
Western and southwestern parts of the country are expected to bear the brunt of the storms in the days ahead. 
Police renewed calls for people to avoid unnecessary journeys even though Iran is celebrating the Nowruz new year holiday, a time when many families travel. 
Iran has implemented measures to stop the rainfall and flooding affecting its main crude oil export terminal on Kharg Island in the Gulf, the head of the Iranian Oil Terminals Company told the semi-official news agency Mehr on Saturday. 
National Iranian Gas Company said earlier that its pipeline network had not been affected by the bad weather.

"(Reuters) - In 2006, a year after hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the U.S. government struck a deal to give states in the region a growing share of offshore drilling revenues to finance projects protecting them from future monster storms. 
But revenues have fallen short of forecasts by half, leaving Louisiana with a gap in financing for a $50 billion plan for projects to raise levees, build flood gates, widen evacuation routes and protect its eroding coastline. 
The shortfall, which federal officials blame on low oil prices, has forced the state to put off critical projects as Louisiana’s congressional delegation pushes for another increase in its share of federal oil revenues. 
The predicament shows how states hosting offshore drilling can get burned by the industry’s boom-and-bust cycles, providing a cautionary tale for other states as the Trump administration proposes to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans. 
Louisiana’s underfinanced coastal projects also highlight the hefty cost of adapting to rising sea levels in a changing climate a problem scientists blame on consumption of fossil fuels. Several coastal states including Florida, Massachusetts, California, and Washington have urged the administration to leave them out of its drilling plans, arguing the environmental costs outweigh the promised jobs and income. 
The stakes are particularly high for Louisiana, which has lost about 2,000 square miles of land over the last century because of Mississippi River levees that block silt from reaching its swamps, the oil industry’s carving of canals through the marshes, and sea level rise from climate change. 
But other states and nations should take notice of Louisiana’s ordeal, said U.S. Representative Garret Graves, a Republican who managed the state’s coastal restoration efforts before joining Congress in 2014. 
“What in Louisiana is a $50 or $70 billion problem, you are talking hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars around the United States and around the world,” he said. 
FAULTY PROJECTIONS 
President George W. Bush signed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) into law in December of 2006, providing storm-battered Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama a 37.5 percent share of federal oil-and-gas royalties from offshore drilling. 
Previously, Gulf Coast states got 27 percent of revenues from federal leases within three miles of their seaward boundaries. 
The changes followed national outrage over the administration’s botched emergency response to catastrophic flooding from the systematic failure of the federally constructed levee system in New Orleans. 
Six months earlier, the chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted the agency had “missed something” in engineering the system, which collapsed at water levels lower than they were designed to withstand. 
For the first ten years, the changes applied to only a fraction of offshore leases. But after that, in larger payouts starting last year, it applied to all offshore leases off the coasts of these states. 
In 2013, the Department of Interior told Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that, under the second phase, they would have at least $375 million to split between them annually through 2055. 
But when the states’ first payment came in late last year, the payout totaled $188 million. 
“That has a huge impact on our planning efforts,” said Chip Kline, chair of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which oversees its 50-year, $50 billion coastal restoration plan. 
Another GOMESA recipient, Alabama, has also felt the pinch. Its Republican governor, Kay Ivey, wrote a letter to then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in March 2018 urging him to support states seeking more offshore revenues. 
“Expanded and enhanced revenue sharing will allow states to more properly address the coastal impacts of offshore production,” she wrote. 
An official for the Texas General Land Office said the lower payouts had not impacted its programs because it had budgeted conservatively. Officials in Mississippi did not respond to requests for comment. 
Department of Interior officials said the shortfall was due to a sharp drop in oil prices since 2013. It would not provide the underlying oil price or production estimates it used in its 2013 projections, saying they were supplied by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and were confidential. 
OMB did not respond to a Reuters request for the data. 
In an emailed statement, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said the bureau no longer provides long-term projections for state revenue from the program. 
OUTSIZED IMPACT 
The shortfall had an outsized impact on Louisiana, which receives almost half the GOMESA program’s revenues because of its geographic proximity to the largest number of offshore wells. It received $82 million in its first phase-two payout, compared to the $177 million it had been counting on. 
Among the shortfall’s biggest impacts, Kline said, would be a delay in completing the state’s massive “Morganza to the Gulf” hurricane protection project, a system of levees and floodgates to protect 150,000 coastal residents of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes from a so-called 100-year storm, defined as having a 1 percent chance of hitting in any given year. 
Lafourche parish is a major seafood and oil industry hub that includes Port Fourchon, the land base for offshore oil and gas services companies. Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes could each lose about 40 percent of their land area in the next 50 years in the absence of effective coastal protection measures, according to state research. 
The Morganza project has been in the works for more than a decade and is expected to cost about $2 billion. Local communities have already agreed to tax increases twice to help fund the unfinished project. 
“We’ve been piecemealing this,” said Reggie Dupre, executive director of the Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District. 
The funding gap also forced state officials to cancel a plan to funnel 10 percent of offshore oil revenue to help finance road improvements along hurricane evacuation routes. 
St. Bernard Parish, which was devastated by flooding after Hurricane Katrina, has its own $1 billion coastal plan, with $600 million in projects ready to move forward. 
It received $781,000 from the 2018 payments, according to John Lane, coastal manager for the parish. 
“There just isn’t enough money coming in,” Lane said. 
LEGISLATIVE PUSH 
While Louisiana officials piece together funding for their projects from other sources, its legislators in Congress are fighting for changes to GOMESA, including increasing the percentage diverted to states from 37.5 percent to 50 percent. 
One such bill, sponsored by Congressman Graves, passed a vote in the House Committee on Natural Resources late last year, before the new Congress was seated. 
FILE PHOTO: A drilling platform is seen near Breton Island, Louisiana May 3, 2010. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo
But the idea faces resistance from those who believe the revenues should be used on national instead of state priorities. Both President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama’s administrations had proposed budgets eliminating or reducing GOMESA payments to finance federal programs instead, before being pushed back by Congress. 
Graves says increasing the revenue share would be a smart move for an administration promoting more offshore drilling. 
“Are you really going to treat (host states) poorly and not reward them, or not keep them happy and healthy so they can continue being productive?” Graves said.

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Armed with laptops, three dozen journalists and fact-checkers braced for battle before a live debate between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his challenger, Prabowo Subianto. 
With two giant screens displaying television network feeds in front of them, the keyboard warriors split into six groups, each responsible for fact-checking a segment of the debate. 
For nearly three hours, their eyes barely left their screens as they attempted to verify candidates’ comments in real time: allegations about corruption, statistics on the country’s Muslim population, boasts, and even personal anecdotes. 
They and other fact-checkers are fighting a running battle against fake news and propaganda ahead of an April 17 election in the world’s third-biggest democracy. 
Election monitors are worried that the flow of misinformation stoking ethnic and religious divides could undermine electoral bodies and even raise social tensions. 
The Cekfakta (“checkfacts” in Indonesian) initiative brings together the non-profit fact-checking organization Mafindo and 24 news organizations that normally compete fiercely with each other during election campaigns. 
“There’s a watchdog now in operation,” Cekfakta co-founder Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of news website Tempo.co, told Reuters. “As a candidate, you cannot throw claims into the air ... we will fact-check them.” 
Backed financially by Google News Lab, which also helps fund Mafindo, Cekfakta’s volunteers took over the U.S tech giant’s swanky Jakarta office for the debate on March 30. 
Dhyatmika wanted to avoid a repeat of the 2014 election, also between Widodo and retired general Prabowo, when reporters were unprepared for the flood of false news that swept across social media. 
‘WE’RE IN A WAR’ 
The fact checkers’ adversaries, fake news peddlers, sit at screens too, pumping out misinformation disguised as fact that often exploits ethnic or religious divides. 
“We’re in a war for content ... people are doing anything they want,” said one fake news creator, who has written stories depicting Indonesian officials as paid off by Beijing. The person declined to be identified because such work is illegal. 
Indonesia’s population of 269 million has a youthful median age of just over 30 years, according to the World Population Review. 
With more than 100 million accounts, the country is Facebook’s third-largest market and a top-five market globally for its platforms WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as rival Twitter. 
Fake news in Indonesia can rack up thousands of views in hours, despite laws against creating and spreading such content. 
Mafindo’s head of fact-checking, Aribowo Sasmito, compares it to the drug trade. 
“There are the factories, the dealers, and the victims. Most of the people who end up arrested are victims ... They read hoaxes and believed them to be true.” 
Since December, Mafindo has documented a surge in political fake news using ethnicity and religion to target both candidates. 
The organization finds most worrisome the dozens of stories that paint electoral bodies as corrupt. This will be only Indonesia’s fourth democratic presidential election. 
Sasmito considers it a good result if fact-checked posts can reach even a small fraction of the audience the originals did. 
Mafindo’s work has made it some enemies. The group has received enough threats that it keeps its office address secret; Cefakta’s website was hacked after a previous debate. 
A Reuters investigation in March found that both the Prabowo and Widodo campaigns were funding sophisticated social media operations to spread propaganda and disinformation through fake accounts on behalf of the candidates. [L3N20Z2EH] 
Both campaigns said they did not use such teams. 
FAKE NEWS CREATORS 
One journalist said he was hired by Prabowo campaign advisers to write positive stories about Prabawo and negative ones on Widodo, to be posted on Facebook and WhatsApp. He said he was not motivated by money but believes the mainstream media is biased in favor of Widodo. 
Fearing government retaliation, the man declined to be named, but he showed Reuters communications that suggested he was he in contact with Prabowo advisers. 
He said he wrote only “true” negative stories, and cited as an example a post that 2,000 Chinese workers on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island were secretly part of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. 
“We have evidence from government contacts and we can see they are soldiers from the way they look,” he said, declining to share such evidence. 
Prabowo campaign spokesman Andre Rosiadi denied any advisers had hired journalists to write “positive or negative content” and “especially not fake news.” 
Asked about the Sulawesi allegation, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia replied to Reuters in a text: “fake news.” 
But such claims also make it onto the campaign trail. A Prabowo campaign volunteer in West Java told Reuters last week that millions of Chinese workers had been secretly relocated to Sulawesi. 
“It’s not hoax, it’s fact,” said volunteer Cecep Abdul Halim. 
Reuters found that the creator of the Sulawesi claim had also written stories in 2016 falsely depicting former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjaha Purnama as a Communist stooge of China. 
Purnama, a Christian ethnic-Chinese Indonesian ally of Widodo, recently completed a two-year prison sentence for blasphemy against Islam based on a video doctored to make him seem he was insulting the Koran. 
The man convicted of making the video, a former journalist, worked for Prabowo’s media team until he was sent to prison last month. A campaign spokesman confirmed he had worked for the media team, but did not comment further. 
Social media data gathered by Mafindo as well as Indonesian big-data consultancy Drone Emprit shows that allegations using China as a bogeyman are widespread in Indonesia, where suspicions about the wealth of the ethnic-Chinese community and the influence of Beijing run deep. 
A disproven video that went viral in January claimed to show seven shipping containers from China at Jakarta’s port filled with millions of ballots punctured in favor of Widodo. 
Common misinformation themes against Widodo portray him alternatively as a member of Indonesia’s banned Communist party, a Chinese plant, or anti-Islam. 
Prabowo, meanwhile, has been depicted as both impious and planning to create a caliphate, while his running mate has been portrayed inaccurately as gay. 
All are inflammatory accusations in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, which rights groups say recently has seen increased prejudice against religious and LGBT minorities. 
And the stories work. Although Widodo enjoys a double-digit lead over Prabowo, three surveys found that a minority of the population believes that he is either a communist or a Christian. 
According to a December poll, as many as 42 percent of Prabowo supporters believed this about Widodo, while 65 percent of Widodo supporters believed Prabowo kidnapped democracy activists while in the military, a claim he strenuously denies. 
Experts say such polarization is dangerous for Indonesia and could stoke anger against minorities. 
“This kind of fake news gains traction because they’re the seeds of intolerance in our society,” said Cefakta’s Dhyatmika. “And it’s not being addressed.”

Ricardo Freitas, a local biologist who has been studying crocodilians in Rio de Janeiro State for 17 years, was not surprised by the existence of a caiman farm inside a favela. People illegally breed caimans across the city to sell to restaurants, he said.
He also suggested that criminals sometimes use the animals to scare kidnapping victims, though there is no evidence that was the case in Favela da Rola.
Mr. Freitas, who dedicates some of his time to rescuing caimans, said that the creatures do not prey on people, but could eat pets. He said there are around 8,000 broad-snouted caimans, the most common species in Rio, in the citys western zone.
It sounds like movie stuff, he said. But its a surreal reality in Rio de Janeiro.","A bus crushed by a fallen tree in a flooded area in Rio de Janeiro.

"As millions of Floridians went to the polls Tuesday to elect new state and federal officials, they also considered another issue that could dramatically shape future elections there: Florida voters decided to amend the state constitution to automatically restore the voting rights of felons after they complete their sentences. The proposal was one of a bevy of policy initiatives on ballots Tuesday, giving voters across the country direct control over issues as varied as health care, the minimum wage, drug policy and, in California, time itself. Passage of the constitutional amendment in Florida will extend voting rights to as many as 1.6 million felons disenfranchised as a result of their criminal convictions. The flood of new voters could disrupt a balance between the two parties in future elections in a state that has traditionally had some of the closest outcomes of any in the country. The result came on the same night that Democrats and Republicans were again locked in exceptionally tight battles for a Senate seat and the governors mansion. Proposed constitutional amendments in Florida require the approval of at least 60 percent of voters for passage, a bar that voters cleared Tuesday night. Florida had been one of just four states to permanently prohibit felons from voting. Under previous law, felons had to apply to the governor for clemency on an individual basis just 3,000 people had successfully navigated the process and had their rights restored in the past eight years. The proposal was supported by a diverse array of interest groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Catholic bishops, a political action committee connected to the conservative Koch brothers and singer John Legend. The initiative, which would exclude people convicted of murder or sexual offenses, had also become an issue in Floridas hotly contested gubernatorial race. The Democratic nominee, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, endorsed its passage; Republican Ron DeSantis, a former congressman, opposed it. If you have done your time and youve paid your debt to society, you ought to be able to reenter society and have your constitutional right to vote and to work here in this state, Gillum said during a recent debate. DeSantis countered: I want people to be redeemed. But youve got to prove that youre getting back with the law. Elsewhere, voters in three reliably Republican-leaning states Idaho, Nebraska and Utah were considering ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Voters in a fourth state, Montana, were weighing whether to extend a Medicaid expansion that was adopted in 2015 and would otherwise expire next year. Obamacare was designed to expand the low-income health-care program automatically, with much of the cost borne by the federal government. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states should be allowed to decide whether to expand it for themselves. Since the ruling, 33 states and the District of Columbia have expanded coverage to those who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line and struggled to purchase insurance. Democrats generally have supported the expansion while Republicans have opposed it, in some cases vociferously, using it as a symbol of their partys opposition to the Democrats signature health-care law. But Republican opposition to the expansion has softened, particularly as polls have showed the expansion to be popular with voters, making the outcome of the ballot initiatives in the three heavily Republican states particularly interesting. In each of the states, voters were given the opportunity to overturn the actions of their state legislatures, which have previously rejected expansion. In Idaho, outgoing Gov. C.L. Butch Otter (R) endorsed the proposition late last month, arguing that the measure would extend health care to 62,000 people, snare $400 million in federal tax money and stabilize financially struggling rural hospitals. The proposal was running ahead in early returns in Utah. Elsewhere, voters considered a variety of other issues. In two Republican-led states, voters considered whether to raise the minimum wage, a test of the popularity of the proposal among GOP voters whose leaders have traditionally opposed the hikes as bad for business. In Arkansas, voters considered whether to gradually raise the states minimum wage from $8.50 an hour to $11 an hour by 2021. And in Missouri, voters weighed whether to raise the $7.85 minimum to $12 an hour by 2023. Early returns suggested the measures would probably pass in both states. Voters in four states faced measures that would loosen laws that govern the usage of marijuana, part of a national shift toward decriminalization of pot. The ballot measures in Michigan and North Dakota would legalize the recreational use of the drug. In early returns, the proposal appeared to be ahead in Michigan but significantly behind in North Dakota. In Missouri and Utah, voters considered whether to allow marijuanas use for medicinal purposes. Early returns showed the proposal trailing in Missouri but ahead in Utah. Washington state voters on Tuesday considered adopting the nations most aggressive effort to combat climate change, a carbon tax that would impose a $15-per-ton fee on some emissions, automatically rising over time. Supporters said the tax was a way to discourage the use of energy sources that are leading to the planets rising temperatures. Opponents argued the tax would hurt businesses and low-income residents. In California, which has a long tradition of putting major policy decisions to popular vote on the ballot, voters considered 11 separate measures. One proposal would repeal a 12-cent-a-gallon gas tax that was adopted by the legislature last year to raise money to improve state roads. Another proposal would allow cities and counties to enforce rent control on more buildings, part of an effort to control runaway housing costs in the nations most-populous state. A third measure could affect how Californians tell time. In the sunshine-loving state, the measure would start a process that could result in California adopting daylight saving time all year. The system would mean clocks would not change in California when the rest of the country changed time in the fall and spring. If the measure passes, the legislature would still need to approve it by a two-thirds vote and federal law would need to be changed.","Washington Post Florida voters restore voting rights for felons, amid bevy of ballot measures nationwide Washington Post As millions of Floridians went to the polls Tuesday to elect new state and federal officials, they also considered another issue that coul…",2018-11-07T03:09:55Z,"Florida voters restore voting rights for felons, amid bevy of ballot measures nationwide - Washington Post",The Washington Post,0
"CHICAGO/COLUMBUS, Neb. (Reuters) - At least 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) of U.S. farmland were flooded after the ""bomb cyclone"" storm left wide swaths of nine major grain producing states under water this month, satellite data analyzed by Gro Intelligence for Reuters showed.  
Farms from the Dakotas to Missouri and beyond have been under water for a week or more, possibly impeding planting and damaging soil. The floods, which came just weeks before planting season starts in the Midwest, will likely reduce corn, wheat and soy production this year.
""There's thousands of acres that won't be able to be planted,"" Ryan Sonderup, 36, of Fullerton, Nebraska, who has been farming for 18 years, said in a recent interview.
""If we had straight sunshine now until May and June, maybe it can be done, but I don't see how that soil gets back with expected rainfall."" 
Spring floods could yet impact an even bigger area of cropland. The U.S. government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of what could be an ""unprecedented flood season"" as it forecasts heavy spring rains. Rivers may swell further as a deep snow pack in northern growing areas melts.
The bomb cyclone of mid-March was the latest blow to farmers suffering from years of falling income and lower exports because of the U.S.-China trade war.
Fields are strewn with everything from silt and sand to tires and some may not even be farmed this year. The water has also destroyed billions of dollars of old crops that were in storage, as well as damaging roads and railways.
Justin Mensik, a fifth-generation farmer of corn and soybeans in Morse Bluff, Nebraska, said rebuilding roads was the first priority. Then farmers would need to bring in fertilizer trucks and then test soil before seeding, Mensik said.

The flood ""left a lot of silt and sand and mud in our fields, now we're not too sure if we're going to be able to get a good crop this year with all the new mud and junk that's just laying here,"" Mensik told Reuters. 
CORN CONCERN
For farmers, ""the biggest concern right now is corn planting,"" said Aaron Saeugling, an agriculture expert at Iowa State University who does outreach with farmers. ""There is just not going to be enough time to move a lot of that debris.""
To be fully covered by crop insurance, Iowa farmers must plant corn by May 31 and soybeans by June 15, as yields decline dramatically when planted any later. Deadlines vary state by state. The insurance helps ensure a minimum price farmers will receive when they book sales for their crops. 
Nearly 1.1 million acres of cropland and more than 84,000 acres of pastureland in the U.S. Midwest had flood water on it for at least seven days between March 8 and March 21, according to a preliminary analysis of government and satellite data by New-York based Gro Intelligence at the request of Reuters. The extent of the flooding had previously not been made public.
The flooded acreage represents less than 1 percent of U.S. land used to grow corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, cotton, sorghum and barley. In 2018, some 240 million total acres of these crops were planted in the United States, USDA data shows.
Iowa, the top U.S. corn and No. 2 soy producing state, had the most water, covering 474,271 acres, followed by Missouri with 203,188 acres, according to Gro Intelligence. That was in line with estimates given to Reuters this week by government officials in Iowa and Missouri. 
Gro Intelligence used satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) Near Real-Time Global Flood Mapping product, to calculate the approximate extent and intensity of flooding. 
Gro Intelligence then identified how much of this area was either cropland or pastureland, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). 
Gro Intelligence analysts cautioned the satellite imagery did not show the full extent of flooding in Nebraska, where officials declined to provide acreage estimates to Reuters, or in North Dakota. Nebraska's governor has said the floods caused agricultural damage of $1 billion in his state.
Cloud cover or snow on the ground makes it difficult to identify the flood waters in NASA satellite data, said Sara Menker, chief executive of the agricultural artificial intelligence company. 
LOST CATTLE
In Missouri, floodwaters covered roughly 200,000 acres in five northwest counties adjoining the Missouri River as of Wednesday morning, said Charlie Rahm, spokesman for USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service in Columbia.
In Wisconsin more than 1,000 dairy and beef animals were lost during winter storms and 480 agricultural structures collapsed or damaged, according to an email from Sandy Chalmers, executive director of the Wisconsin state office of the USDAs Farm Service Agency.
In the Dakotas and Minnesota, melting snows in coming months will put spring wheat planting at risk. Gro Intelligence found nearly 160 million acres have already been flooded in Minnesota.
""That's yet to come and we will deal with that at least until the middle of April,"" said Dave Nicolai, an agriculture expert at the University of Minnesota.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street will be watching next week’s economic data with a laser focus after a dismal February jobs report and recessionary warning signals from U.S. Treasury yields. 
After the longest U.S. government shutdown on record, bad weather and a late 2018 equities sell-off muddied market participants’ view on the U.S. economy in recent months, they are hoping for a clearer view from upcoming data. 
Investors have been anxious for reassurance since U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields last Friday fell below three-month Treasury bill yields for the first time since 2007. 
The S&amp;P fell almost 2 percent that day as yield curve inversions are widely viewed as recessionary indicators and this one occurred two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled back on expected rate hikes amid signs of slowing economic growth. 
“Investors are going to be hyper-sensitive to data,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. “The yield curve inversion is the manifestation of investors’ fears that the U.S. is getting caught up in a global slowdown.” 
Many investors say they do not expect a U.S. recession any time soon. But they are seeking confirmation for this optimism in next week’s data, which includes retail sales, manufacturing activity, durable goods orders and non-farm payrolls. 
Reports that meet or beat expectations “would suggest the soft patch we entered the year with is temporary” and would confirm economic projections for 2019, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. 
February’s U.S. retail sales data, due on Monday, and the March jobs report, scheduled for Friday, may be the most closely watched indicators as economists want reassurance on the spending power and confidence of U.S. consumers, which represent about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. 
U.S. non-farm payroll growth almost stalled in February, with only 20,000 jobs created. Economists polled by Reuters last expected an average of 170,000 new jobs for March. 
January retail sales rose a modest 0.2 percent after a December decline, but were not seen as strong enough to alter slowing U.S. economic momentum. Economists, on average, expect a February increase of 0.3 percent. 
“If we were to witness a faltering of the U.S consumer, that would be very difficult for markets, which are relying on the U.S. consumer to propel the cycle through at least another year,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife in Toronto. 
Graphic: Jobs rebound sharply in month following last two slowdowns - tmsnrt.rs/2HNQePZ
But Donald expects a rebound in both retail sales and jobs, since the last reports were weakened by the December-January government shutdown. She will also watch durable goods data, due on Tuesday, for a view on corporate capital spending. 
“I have less conviction capex will take off markedly, but if we do see an improvement, that would be a substantial surprise,” said Donald. 
Strong capex would also surprise TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan, who says companies have stalled spending as they await the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks. 
Kinahan says U.S.-China tensions could mute market reactions to data “unless it’s so far off to the upside or the downside.” The two countries are due to negotiate in Washington, D.C., next week after what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said were “constructive” talks in Beijing this week. 
Options contracts on the S&amp;P 500 Index and its tracking fund, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, show a modest uptick in the volatility priced into contracts expiring next Friday, compared with other near-term expirations. 
“We should expect more volatile days,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Probably the job numbers will be the biggest focus, partly because of February’s miss and partly due to the overall concerns about slower growth.” 
Manufacturing data will also be under close scrutiny on Monday after weak U.S. and German March data last Friday, according to Cresset’s Ablin. 
While Ameriprise’s Price is expecting solid data, he cautions: “The market has more downside risk than upside risk primarily because of the yield inversion, the concern over the tone of economic data over the past few months, not just in the United States, but around the world.”

"GUARA GUARA, Mozambique (Reuters) - At a camp near the city of Beira for people rescued from Mozambique’s catastrophic flooding, residents were dealing on Friday with worries about their future and shortages of pretty much everything - water, food and medicines. 
Also, painfully, some of them lacked information about how their relatives were faring. 
Aid organizations such as the World Food Programme and Red Cross are delivering food, water, shelter and other basic supplies to the camp at Guara Guara, which was set up by the government, and scores of others like it in the flood zone around Beira. 
But with roads cut off, progress is slow. Camps like the one at Guara Guara, 45 km (30 miles) west of Beira, can be reached only by helicopter. There are a limited number of craft available and they are in huge demand. 
Fernando Marevere, a local village chief, said the main concern for new arrivals at Guara Guara was food and medicines, which were both in short supply. 
Eight large tents were sent to the camp on Wednesday, but on Friday most people were outside in the blazing sun, or huddling into small patches of shade cast by the branches of sparse trees. 
People also took shelter in the village’s secondary school whose roof was still intact sitting or slumped, head down, at its wooden desks. A number of elderly women were curled up on their side on the dirt floor. 
Fresh water was in low supply and there were no toilets. The camp’s residents, numbering in the hundreds, washed in a stream nearby. 
Medical tents were small and cramped. 
A young boy bawled as doctors worked on a deep cut on his foot, as a family friend held him still and shielded his face from the gore. 
Augusto Jose, a pharmacy technician who had come from Beira to help, told Reuters the main concern was malaria, and how to diagnose it with so few tests at hand. 
Esther Zinge, 60, from near the town of Buzi, had not eaten anything yet on Friday. She had missed breakfast while waiting in line with her husband for the doctor, because he was unwell. 
“The help is coming, but it’s coming very slowly,” she said, adding that what did arrive had to be given to children first. 
“We had to ask a local hospital for soya milk so we can stretch out the food. All we’ve had so far is biscuits,” she said. “The conditions are terrible, and more people keep coming.” 
Cyclone Idai pummeled the port city of Beira and its low-lying surrounds last week with ferocious winds and tore inland, dumping torrential rains and causing massive flooding in swathes of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. 
The storm killed 242 people in Mozambique and 259 in Zimbabwe, and numbers were expected to rise, relief agencies said. In Malawi, 56 died in heavy rains before the onset of Idai. 
‘MISSING FAMILIES’ 
Left with nothing, many people at Guara Guara were concerned for their future or the health of their small children. But the biggest fear, a number of people said, was for relatives and friends they had not heard from since the waters started rising. 
There is no electricity, phones or internet at the camp. 
“I could escape, but my nephew didn’t because he was not able to walk. He was sick and now I don’t know where he is,” said Zinge. 
Louisa Ndena, 60, was sitting on the ground in a white aid tent surrounded by family members and toddlers. 
“Besides our missing families, the thing we are most worried about is disease,” she said, explaining that there are no toilets, and if the village’s residents would not let them use theirs, they use bushes for privacy. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday its relief efforts included sending teams to the region to help families without access to telephones or the internet find their missing relatives. 
“The agony of not knowing what happened to your loved ones in a disaster like Cyclone Idea is indescribable,” said Diane Araujo, an ICRC delegate deploying to Beira. 
At Guara Guara, Albino Jose Albino, 18, was alone in the camp aside from friends, without an idea about what happened to his mother or seven siblings. 
He too complained about a lack of food, water and shelter, but was more angry that he had no way to register his family as missing. 
“They are not giving us details about our families, our lost families,” he said. “Someone should be responsible for this.”

"Dense tissue makes cancer harder to find on mammograms because the tissue and tumors both show up as white and blend together. Fat looks black, so tumors stand out more in fatty breasts.
About three dozen states already require that women be given information about breast density. The new F.D.A. rules propose specific language that would be used nationwide to explain breast density, note that some women may need more imaging tests and recommend that patients talk to their doctors about their results.
The F.D.A. language would be the minimum required, but states would be free to require more information, Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the F.D.A.s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a news briefing.
Some in the medical profession have objected to this type of notification, arguing that not all women with dense tissue have the same increased risk of breast cancer, and that reporting the condition could frighten women and lead to a flood of unnecessary screening tests and biopsies. Doctors have also said that many of the state-mandated letters were too hard for patients to understand.
The F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who will be leaving the agency on April 5, said in an interview that the new proposal had been high on the list of actions he hoped to take before departing. He acknowledged that some physicians opposed notifying women about breast density, but he said women had a right to receive the information and decide what to do about it.","Examining the mammogram of a patient with dense breast tissue at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center in Sacramento.",2019-03-27T17:26:56Z,"Mammogram Centers Must Tell Women if They Have Dense Breasts, F.D.A.

"design Published 13th November 2018 When Thai architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom was a little girl she used to play in the flood waters of Bangkok. Now, she's helping to reduce flooding in the city with her innovative urban design. Bangkok, a city of more than 8 million people, sits in the low-lying Chao Phraya River Delta and is on average just 1.5 meters above sea level. Heavy rainfall in the wet season makes it vulnerable to flooding. To make matters worse, sea levels are rising, and the city is sinking -- under the weight of its buildings and because too much water has been pumped from the aquifers beneath it. But help is coming from an unlikely source -- a park in the heart of the city. Centennial Park, built on the campus of Chulalongkorn University, is a beautiful green space complete with fountains, exercise bikes and a children's playground. Designed by Voraakhom and her landscape architecture firm Landprocess, there's more to this 11-acre (45,000 square meter) park than meets the eye. ""This park isn't just (about) beautification or recreation,"" Voraakhom told CNN. ""It's helping the city deal with water."" Numerous design features combine to help the park store rainwater and save the surrounding streets from flooding during heavy rains. The park is built on an incline, and its slanted main lawn and the angled roof of the park's museum combine to funnel rain water into its sloped gardens. As it runs through the gardens, the water collects in artificial wetlands. From there, the water flows into a retention pond, which can hold nearly 480,000 gallons (1,800 cubic meters). Beneath the porous ground is a water tank with a capacity of nearly 160,000 gallons (600 cubic meters). In all, the park can hold up to one million gallons (4,546 cubic meters) of water. ""We need to rethink our city,"" said Voraakhom. ""It's not about getting rid of floods or engineering solutions of building a big dam, but it's about how (we) can live with water."" Herbert Dreiseitl is a landscape and waterscape architect, and a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore. He told CNN the project is a good example of how to creatively use the landscape for a multifunctional purpose. ""This kind of project... starts where the rain is landing on the surface -- on open spaces, on green parks, on rooftops -- and it's delaying and handling the water the right way,"" he said. The park also provides green space in a heavily developed city, says Dreiseitl, making Bangkok more attractive and people friendly. According to the Asian City Green Index, which compares 22 major Asian cities, Bangkok has just 3 square meters of green space per person, which is far below the index average of 39 square meters per person. The park, which was completed in March 2017, is too small to have an impact beyond the immediate neighborhood, but Voraakhom wants it to act as a case study for other places, showing that cities can be re-engineered to combine landscape architecture with green solutions. ""This is a kind of soft revolution in city planning,"" said Dreiseitl. ""It will take some time, but these good solutions are convincing for other private investors and government structures or municipalities to follow this model."" He added that this kind of park could work in other cities, but a lack of space and resources might be an issue. Landprocess is now working on a similar park at Thammasat University, in Pathum Thani province, a flood-prone area just north of Bangkok. According to the company, the park will be three times larger than Centennial Park and have triple the water-storage capacity. It is set to open next year.","When Thai architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom was a little girl she used to play in the flood waters of Bangkok.

"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is reversing a controversial decision on how the federal government manages its massive backlog of civil rights complaints by students and their families, agreeing to no longer dismiss cases that are filed en masse and restoring its appeals process. The move, announced by the Education Department this week, could impact hundreds of cases involving children with special needs whose families believe their schools aren't providing adequate accommodations. The decision is a temporary victory for a coalition of civil rights groups the NAACP, the National Federation of the Blind and the Council for Parent Advocates and Attorneys that sued the government this summer. They claimed the Education Department was tossing aside legitimate civil rights grievances in the interest of government efficiency and clearing a backlog. That lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, is ongoing as the civil rights groups seek to make the approach announced this week permanent and binding. The Education Departments reversal ""shows that recent legal action taken against them is working,"" said Denise Marshall, executive director for the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates. The Education Department's Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus said ensuring equal access to education remains a ""top priority"" for the department. Marcus - who took over the Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, in June - said in the statement that he decided to alter the investigative protocols after receiving important and constructive feedback on it. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies during a Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations hearing in Washington, D.C, June 5, 2018. While we continue to work to improve the timeliness of OCR case processing, we have determined that additional revisions will help improve our work and allow us to be more responsive to students, stakeholders, and our staff, he said. At issue is a decision last March in which the Education Department said it would dismiss civil rights grievances that were part of a pattern of complaints that placed an undue burden on the government. The Education Department also at the time eliminated the appeals process. The changes were included in a case processing manual used by federal officials who investigate civil rights complaints at schools. Marcie Lipsitt, a Michigan advocate for special education students, said the move was aimed at people like her. Lipsitt said she filed some 2,400 complaints in two years claiming that certain school websites, including online math programs, werent accessible for the blind or visually impaired. Lipsitt said she had already resolved more than 1,000 of those complaints with school districts. But after the Education Department changed its investigative protocols last March, she received a flood of notifications that hundreds of her complaints would be dismissed. She said she was infuriated ""that they could basically destroy all the work Ive done in just a couple weeks."" Eve Hill, a lawyer representing the civil rights groups, said she believes the Education Department's decision to backtrack was intended to invalidate the lawsuit. Shortly before the announcement, Hill, who works for the Baltimore-based firm Brown, Goldstein and Levy, said she had asked the judge in the case to lift a temporary stay and move ahead with litigation. Hill said the lawsuit isn't over because the recent change amounts to a non-binding promise that could be reversed at any point. She said she wants a settlement agreement or a ruling from the federal judge that would permanently block the government from dismissing serial filings. Theres no reason to do that, Hill said. People face discrimination more than once. Its the Education Departments job to investigate them. Also unclear is what will happen to the 692 cases filed by five people - including Lipsitt and her son - that were dismissed after the new approach took effect in March. An Education Department spokesman said the office plans to look at the issues raised in the previously dismissed cases. The NAACP said it will back its legal team in demanding that the government agree to investigate those 692 cases and make this new policy permanent. ""The right to an equal education is fundamental to the principles of this country, and denying students the right to enforce their civil rights denies them the foundation they need to succeed and contribute to their communities,"" said NAACP President Derrick Johnson.",A move by Betsy DeVos could impact hundreds of cases involving children with special needs whose families believe their schools aren't providing adequate accommodations.,2018-11-21T17:23:58Z,Education Secretary DeVos reverses stance on civil rights probes that led to suit,ABC News,0

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
The storm will interact with a low in the Gulf Of Mexico and bring snow, freezing rain, sleet and flooding in the southern U.S. through Friday. Winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories, flash flood watches and winter storm watches are in effect for parts of the southern U.S. from Arizona to Mississippi.
Storm alerts cover most of the southern U.S. on Wednesday due to two storms moving through the region.
Temperatures are at or just below freezing in central Texas, which could make for slick spots Wednesday morning if rains freezes on contact with the ground. Travel between Abilene and Fort Worth could be treacherous in spots on Wednesday morning.
An icy mix is possible from San Angelo to Fort Worth during the day Wednesday, while snow moves from Tucson to El Paso. On the warmer side of the systems, heavy rain will move along a stationary front from Corpus Christi to Birmingham, Alabama. Locally heavy downpours are possible in central and southern Louisiana, as well as southeast Texas. Flash flooding is also possible in this region.
Rain is falling in eastern Texas while a rain and snow mix is likely farther west.
By Thursday morning, as the systems merge, another round of heavy rain is possible across southeast Texas and much of Louisiana. Another round of snow and ice will move across central and western Texas. There is a possibility some of this precipitation will make its way into parts of Oklahoma on Thursday, including the greater Oklahoma City metro area.
Heavy rain will move into the entire Gulf Coast region by Thursday.
The storm finally organizes by Friday morning and starts sliding off to the east. Unfortunately, the storm will still bring another round of very heavy rain for parts of the Gulf Coast.
Through Friday, 3 to 6 inches of rain are possible locally in parts of southeast Texas and much of Louisiana. Nearly 1 to 3 inches of rain are possible for the rest of the Gulf Coast from Texas to Georgia. Flash flooding will be a concern in this region for the next several days.
A few inches of snow are possible in western Texas and New Mexico, while 3 to 6 inches is possible across parts of the Gulf Coast through Friday night.
The worst ice should stay west of Fort Worth and Austin, but some slick roads are possible in parts of I-35 metro areas where temperatures dip down to freezing overnight.
As for snow, 3 to 6 inches are possible in parts of southern New Mexico to western Texas. It is unclear how much ice and snow will make its way into Oklahoma on Thursday. Accumulations of ice and snow in Oklahoma will ultimately depend on its ability to maintain colder temperatures as the storm tries to pull mild air northward.
Clipper heads toward Northeast
A quick-moving storm will slide down from Canada later Wednesday and quickly race across the Great Lakes and move into the Northeast by Wednesday evening.
This type of winter storm, called a clipper, generally brings a quick burst of light snow. Some light snow will move into parts of the Northeast by Wednesday evening and last into the early hours of Thursday.
A clipper system could deliver a few inches of snow to parts of the interior Northeast on Thursday.
This clipper narrowly misses an opportunity to combine with a developing disturbance in the Southeast and dump serious accumulation.
However, there could be 1 to 2 of snow in parts of the Northeast through Thursday morning, with all likely accumulations north and west of the i-95 corridor from New York to Boston.",The storm moving across the South will deliver a difficult commute.,2019-01-02T11:27:51Z,"Snow, ice and rain bring headaches across southern US",ABC News,1

"A powerful storm continues to move through the Northeast on Sunday, after it brought up to 15 inches of snow in the Midwest and three reported tornadoes in the South.
The winter storm will dump snowfall totals of 10 to 20 inches in parts of the Northeast before moving out of the region later in the day Sunday. In the wake of the storm, temperatures in the Northeast will drop nearly 40 degrees as an arctic blast settles over the eastern U.S.
Select snowfall totals as of Sunday morning:
Heron Lake, Minnesota: 15 inchesBluffton, Iowa: 14 inchesMansfield, Ohio: 10.5 inchesMcHenry, Illinois: 10 inchesStormstown, Pennsylvania: 9 inchesStaffordville, Connecticut: 4.2 inchesProvidence, Rhode Island: 4 inches
Heavy snow is showing on the radar Sunday morning from Ohio to Maine with the heaviest bands over much of New York state. Snowfall rates there are estimated to be at 1 to 2 inches per hour. A mix of rain, sleet, freezing rain and snow is currently falling across parts of the Lower Hudson Valley into much of Connecticut and southern Massachusetts.
A mix of snow, ice and rain will continue throughout the day on Sunday in the Northeast.
Very heavy rain is falling farther south in New York City and Philadelphia. New flood alerts are being issued for parts of the New York and Philadelphia metro areas, due to the possibility of 1 to 2 inches of rain. Additionally, coastal flooding is a concern through the day from New Jersey to Massachusetts.
Strong winds are likely from the Tennessee Valley all the way to Florida on Sunday. Behind the storm is the very cold air that is already moving into the Midwest and is on the way to the Northeast, where new wind chill alerts have been issued for many major Northeast cities.
Additional snowfall on Sunday is expected to be confined mainly to the interior Northeast, with over 12 more inches of snow still to come in parts of New York, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. Locally, over a quarter of an inch of ice is also possible across parts of the Lower Hudson Valley, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Snow totals in the interior Northeast should top out at approximately 10 to 20 inches.
Northern New England could still see over a foot of snow through the day Sunday.
The storm is pulling in a lot of mild air to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York, which is keeping the snow and mixed precipitation north and west of these cities. However, the danger is not over yet.
As the storm slides east, it will begin to drag the very cold air behind it. The clash of colder and milder air will increase winds significantly as the day goes on. Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York all are seeing temperatures in the 40s and even 50s on Sunday morning.
However, by early afternoon, temperatures will come crashing down.
A flash freeze will move in behind the storm during the day on Sunday.
By Sunday night, the actual air temperature will crash into the single digits and teens across the Interstate 95 corridor. In interior parts of the Northeast, temperatures will go below zero with a fresh snow pack. After starting Sunday in the 40s and 50s from Washington to New York, temperatures will have dropped 40 to nearly 50 degrees by Sunday night.
Everything that has fallen, from snow to sleet to rain, will freeze over. This could make traveling dangerous Sunday night and Monday morning. This situation, called a flash freeze, can make it harder to treat some road surfaces.
Temperatures will be in the single digits across most of the Northeast on Monday morning.
The Northeast is not alone in dealing with brutal cold. The central U.S. is seeing wind chills in the teens all the way down to the Mississippi Valley on Sunday.
Gusty winds and very low temperatures will cause wind chills of minus 10 to minus 20 across the Northeast, including Philadelphia, New York and Boston.
The wind chills on Monday morning will be dangerously low, well below zero, across the whole Northeast.

The same storm brought very heavy rain to parts of the southern U.S., causing flooding in parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Florida on Wednesday. Mild air combined with heavy rain caused flooding in parts of Ohio as local waterways rose due to melting ice and rainfall. The storm also brought widespread snowfall from Iowa to Michigan with over 6 inches in spots.
Rain stretches from New England to Florida on Thursday morning.
Heavy rain was falling across parts of the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia on Thursday morning. Rainfall rates could approach 2 inches per hour in the morning.
Rain will intensify in the Northeast as the cold front interacts with the unusually mild air and create heavy downpours in the major Northeast cities during the morning hours, and through the early afternoon.
Along with the heavy rain, wind gusts over 35 mph are possible Thursday in the Northeast, especially on the coast line. Winds on the coast could locally gust to 50 mph and cause power outages and damaging winds.
Heavy rain and gusty winds will move into the Northeast throughout the day on Thursday.
Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are possible in the Northeast, which will cause localized flooding. In addition, mild air is rapidly melting snow and ice, which could cause additional flooding.
Temperatures will start to drop with the passage of a cold front and could bring some mixed precipitation to parts of the interior Northeast on Thursday. All accumulations should be on the light side, but wet surfaces could get icy in areas outside major cities.
Flood alerts and wind alerts have been issued for much of the East Coast through the day. Behind the storm, winter is beginning to make an intense push into the central U.S., with rounds of cold air, and a ground blizzard for parts of the Northern Plains.
Waves of cold will move into the central U.S. over the end of the week and into the weekend.
There are several waves of cold air, likely each one increasing in intensity, lurking in the central U.S. and Canada. A cold blast has already begun to take hold of the central U.S. Thursday morning with wind chills in the single digits and teens from the upper Midwest to the Mississippi River Valley.
Wind chills could dip as low as minus 20 across much of the Northern Plains on Friday morning.
Another round of reinforcing cold air comes into the upper Midwest on Friday, and wind chills of minus 20 to minus 40 degrees likely in parts of the upper Midwest. Wind chills in Chicago and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will be nearly minus 20 or lower.
Then, over the weekend, the cold air will widen in scope, but decrease in intensity. On Sunday another round of cold air starts to move in from Canada and begins to impact the upper Midwest. Wind chills will plummet again, with very cold temperatures likely lasting through daylight hours in places like Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Fargo, North Dakota. Wind chills on Sunday morning could dip below minus 40 degrees in the upper Midwest.
Wind chills will be in the teens and 20s across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday morning.
The blast of polar air tries to make its way into the rest of the central U.S. early next week. There are strong signals on both global operational forecast models that well below average temperatures are in store for much of the central and parts of the eastern U.S. next week. It is too early to determine how low the wind chills will go at this point.

"Just after news broke that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had finished his 22 month long investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, President Donald Trump appeared to exhale.
The president who was described by sources as being in a great mood spent a festive evening dining on the patio at Mar-a-Lago with First Lady Melania Trump, the first ladys parents, and the couples son, Barron.
At one point, the family joined by other club members sang Happy Birthday to Barron who was celebrating his 13th birthday.
Trump told those gathered at the presidents Palm Beach retreat he was glad its over.
For the last several weeks, as Washington waited for the special counsel to deliver his final report, sources close to the president have described him as antsy -- constantly asking questions about what the report would look like, how much detail would it provide and whether it would deepen the legal and political challenges facing him and his family.
When the call arrived Friday night that Mueller had handed off his report to Attorney General William Barr and would not pursue additional indictments -- the questions stopped, the sources told ABC News.
The White House has not been briefed on the contents of the special counsels report, according to administration officials.
However, the president, who once described the probe as a cloud over my head, told one source he felt the cloud had been lifted.
After dinner, the president addressed supporters briefly at a Republican fundraiser but made no mention of Mueller, according to those present.
Trump later returned to the patio at his Florida country club. He and the first lady sat with Donald Trump Jr and his girlfriend former Fox News anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle, as they sipped coffee.
At one point on Friday evening, Trump was briefly praising Attorney General Barr for his leadership, according to a source close the president.
""We feel very prepared for the results. We feel like we're going to be fine, one administration official told ABC News. There's a feeling of it is what is it and it's not a very big deal. There isn't an enormous sense of concern. But let's see the facts.""
The president had not offered any public reaction in remarks or on Twitter as of early Saturday. Several aides noted his restraint with surprise, especially in regards to his Twitter account. For nearly the last two years, the president has been on an almost daily tirade about the special counsels probe calling it a hoax and a witch hunt.
The president was in Mar-a-Lago for planned meetings with the leaders of various Caribbean nations and was joined on the trip by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. A late add to the manifest of Air Force One: another White House lawyer, Emmet Flood, who serves as the main lawyer handling issues related to the presidency as it relates to the Mueller investigation.
Sources said the attorneys accompanied the president as a precaution when it appeared possible that Mueller would be concluding his work. As speculation mounted Friday that Mueller would be sending a report to Barr, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders quickly raced to join the president on his trip.
In the letter to Congress Barr submitted Friday, he said he could be sharing the principal conclusions of the report with lawmakers as soon as this weekend. Barr arrived at his office at the Department of Justice mid-morning Saturday and sources tell ABC News he is expected to read Muellers report for much of the day.
Democrats on Capitol Hill have a conference call led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slated for Saturday afternoon to go over strategy on dealing with Muellers findings and Barrs report according to a senior Democratic leadership aide.
With the 2020 campaign already heating up, the Trump re-election team is already preparing their victory lap.
A separate source close to the Trump campaign told ABC News Trump allies may soon take to the airwaves regarding Democrats reaction to the special counsels probe. Several had already started field testing a new line of response, saying they had not seen so many disappointed or sad faces since election night 2016.
In the meantime, the president spent Saturday golfing at his Palm Beach club. As Trump rode back to his residence, he was greeted by a few dozen supporters waving signs according to a press pool report. One of the signs read: Trump is better than Reagan.","President Donald Trump reportedly in a ""great mood"" as Washington awaits  Attorney General William Barr on special counsel report.",2019-03-23T19:00:51Z,President Trump in a ‘great mood’ after Mueller report passed to DOJ: Sources,ABC News,0
"New York State is suing the family behind the company that makes OxyContin, expanding an already existing lawsuit against other opioid manufacturers and distributors.
New York state Attorney General Letitia James is including eight members of the Sackler family, which owns drug manufacturer Purdue Pharma, in the lawsuit. The amended suit claims the family continued to profit by using a web of corporate entities to fraudulently transfer money to themselves even after being under investigation by federal prosecutors for its opioid marketing practices. It also alleges the Sacklers moved money to offshore accounts while taking payments from Purdue and while being investigated by many states' attorneys general.
In impassioned language, James' office painted a stark picture of the toll of opioid abuse and laid the blame squarely at the feet of the Sacklers, Purdue Pharma and other drug manufacturers.
""The taproot of the opioid epidemic is easy to identify: OxyContin,"" the lawsuit states, alleging that Purdue launched a nationwide marketing campaign in 1996 ""that relied on deception and insider payoffs"" to popularize the drug and overcome the medical communities' concerns about its addictive properties.
""New York State is in the throes of an opioid epidemic that has ravaged the lives of its residents and drained its public coffers for more than two decades,"" the amended lawsuit states. The defendants ""deliberately betrayed"" duties to responsibly prevent drug abuse ""through a persistent course of fraudulent and illegal misconduct, in order to profiteer from the plague they knew would be unleashed.""
Purdue Pharma faces about 2,000 lawsuits related to the opioid crisis. Sackler family members are being sued in a small number about 25 of those cases, according to Paul J. Hanley, Jr. who is the co-lead in the multi-district litigation against opioid manufacturers. He described James' actions to include the family members on Thursday as ""a welcome addition to the litigation.""
""It is probable that many more cases will be filed against them and that existing cases will be amended to add them,"" Hanley wrote in an email to ABC News.
In a statement, Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family members who were named in the lawsuit said they ""vigorously deny the allegations in the New York State Attorney Generals amended complaint, and will continue to defend themselves against these misleading allegations.""
""Such serious allegations demand clear evidence linking the conduct alleged to the harm described, but we believe the state fails to show such causation and offers little evidence to support its sweeping legal claims. Instead, the state is seeking to publicly vilify Purdue and its former directors while unfairly undermining the important work we have taken to address the opioid crisis,"" the statement in response to James' amended suit continued.
The Sacklers, who are worth billions, are facing increasing censure from financial and philanthropic institutions for their role in manufacturing and marketing OxyContin.
The family members defending themselves in response to the lawsuit also issued a statement saying, ""Expanding this baseless lawsuit to include former directors of Purdue Pharma is a misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis. We strongly deny these allegations, which are inconsistent with the factual record, and will vigorously defend against them.""
Jones's office alleges that opioid manufacturers used a common playbook to manipulate public opinion about the safety and risk of prescription opioids.
""Manufacturers pushed claims that opioids could improve quality of life and cognitive functioning, promoted false statements about the non-addictive nature of these drugs, masked signs of addiction by referring to them as pseudoaddiction and encouraged greater opioid use to treat it, and suggested that alternative pain relief methods were riskier than opioids, among other grossly misleading claims,"" Jones said in a press release.
The attorney general also said the drug companies mobilized an army of sales representatives, or detailers, to aggressively promote their messaging and to ""target susceptible doctors, flood publications with their deceptive advertisements, and offer consumers discount cards and other incentives to entice them to request treatment with their products."" Jones' statement said.
Nine people who live in New York State and 130 people across the U.S. die every day from opioid-related deaths, the lawsuit said.
""These people are not and cannot become just statistics,"" the New York lawsuit states. ""They are our family, our friends, our neighbors. They are our fathers and our sons, our mothers and our daughters. They have real names and their deaths have left real, jagged holes in the fabric of the communities where they used to live.""",It's the result of a multi-year exhaustive investigation of fraudulent behavior.,2019-03-28T23:17:04Z,"New York sues family behind company that makes OxyContin, expanding existing lawsuit",ABC News,0

A year after a mudslide swept through a fire-devastated California town, killing 21 people, residents of hundreds homes in burn areas were told to pack up and leave as a Pacific storm threatened potential catastrophe.
In Riverside County east of Los Angeles, mandatory evacuations were ordered Monday for a dozen areas around the Holy Fire, which swept through an enormous swath of the Cleveland National Forest and surrounding areas last August.
""People in these zones MUST GO NOW. Rainstorms carry the potential for dangerous debris flows that can send mud, boulders and trees crashing down hillsides"" with little or no warning, a county statement said.
The evacuation was later downgraded to voluntary but authorities urged people to stay alert because of continuing rain forecasts.
In Santa Barbara County on the central coast, evacuation orders were set to take effect at 10 a.m. Tuesday for areas hit by the Sherpa, Whittier and Thomas fires.
""Gather family members, pets, and essential items,"" a county statement said. A debris flow could also make roads impassable and strand people near the evacuation areas, especially in Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria, the county warned.
After a devastating fire that burned and destabilized foothills, Montecito was hit by a powerful storm on Jan. 9, 2018, that sent water, mud and boulders sluicing down creeks and canyons. Twenty-three people died and more than 100 homes were destroyed.
Weather forecasters have predicted a series of storms that could continue to bring rain and snow into the middle of the week. Flash flood watches were issued by the National Weather Service for burn areas in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, which could see as much as an inch of rain per hour from Tuesday afternoon into the evening.
All schools in Malibu were closed Tuesday.
Flooding and debris flows were a threat to hundreds of homes in areas below foothills and canyons that were swept by flames in recent years.
Los Angeles County authorities issued evacuation orders beginning Tuesday morning for some areas of the Woolsey Fire. The blaze that broke out in November destroyed more than 1,500 homes and other buildings from Ventura County to Malibu and killed four people.
On Monday, the first in the series of storms dumped an inch of rain in Los Angeles and snow in the mountains.
Rain closed the Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement parks.

In Encino, in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, a guest house was pushed off its foundation by a 250-foot-long (76-meter) debris flow from a hillside. No one was hurt but the Fire Department said up to a dozen other homes were in the slide zone.

"SAN FRANCISCO Thousands of people along a flooded river were under evacuation orders Wednesday as a relentless storm pounded Northern California, drenching the San Francisco Bay Area and pummeling the Sierra Nevada with snow.
Some two dozen communities along the Russian River in Sonoma County were ordered evacuated Tuesday evening shortly before the waterway passed flood stage. Forecasters predicted it would peak at about 46 feet (14 meters) by Wednesday evening, which would be the highest level in about a quarter-century.
Authorities said evacuations were ordered for about 4,000 people in and around Guerneville, located about an hour's drive north of San Francisco.
""We want you to leave now,"" Sheriff Mark Essick warned. ""The roads may become impassable and you may not be able to get out. So even if you live in an area that is not flooding at this moment, you may not be able to get out when the water rises.""
There also was concern about potential mudslides in hillside areas saturated from days of downpours, and in areas scarred by 2017 wildfires.
Earlier in the day, a mudslide near Monte Rio near Guerneville trapped a man and a woman before they were rescued, messy but unharmed.
""Well I fell into the mud when the tree fell over the top of me. It happened so fast you don't even know, you know?"" Kear Koch told KGO-TV.
Elsewhere in Sonoma County, several people had to be rescued from cars that became stranded while trying to drive through flooded roads, including one woman who was rescued by boat.
Earlier Tuesday at the River Inn Grill in Guerneville, workers were preparing by putting perishables on high shelves in storage rooms.
But manager Andre Vazquez said the one-story building could be largely submerged that if the river reaches 46 feet.
""If it gets to 46 feet, it's done. There is no way to prepare for that,"" Vazquez said.
Guerneville often floods during heavy rain and people seemed nonchalant Tuesday about the threat, said Joseph Chung, whose parents own the Koala's Fine Food restaurant.
""A couple of weeks ago people were using kayaks to get to their mailbox,"" Chung said. ""If it gets really bad, we'll get out.""
But Dee Dee Rydberg removed computers and printers from her business, Guerneville Graphics and Printing.
""We're getting ready for the flooding. My threshold is 43 feet,"" she told KPIX-TV. ""Flood insurance raised 800 percent throughout the area. I could not afford to buy flood insurance. So I'm packing up my stuff and getting out.""
Several communities also were under evacuation orders in Butte County because of flooded creeks. Other waterways, including the Napa River, also were expected to overflow their banks as an ocean-spanning plume of moisture continued tracking through the West. It already closed roads and schools and toppled trucks and trees from Oregon to Montana.
The National Weather Service also issued flood warnings and flash flood watches for the San Francisco Bay Area and many parts of the Sacramento area, lasting into Thursday morning.
Relentless rain forced the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights in San Francisco and the city of Santa Rosa received a record 5.66 inches (14 centimeters) of rain, making it the wettest day for the date since at least 1902.
In the Sierra Nevada, the California Department of Transportation reported that a maintenance yard above 6,000 feet had received 30 inches (76 centimeters) of snow along on Tuesday.
Several mountain and foothill roads were repeatedly closed because of whiteout conditions or to clear trucks and cars that spun out on the slippery pavement.
Interstate 80, a major road that winds over the Donner Summit, was to remain closed into Wednesday morning for about 50 miles (80 kilometers), from Colfax to the Nevada state line.","Thousands ordered to leave as California river rises Fox News Thousands of people along a flooded river were under evacuation orders Wednesday as a relentless storm pounded Northern California, drenching the San...",2019-02-27T06:37:31Z,Thousands ordered to leave as California river rises - Fox News,Fox News,1
"MEXICO CITY -- As dawn breaks at an outdoor sports stadium here, Mexican Marines are busy cooking beef, eggs and beans for the 2,673 migrants that have arrived here, according to officials. More are expected to arrive this week.
Upon arrival, they receive blankets, shelter, heath care, sanitary amenities and hot meals. They are housed in three massive tents inside the sports complex, are protected by around the clock security and have access to a soccer field and playground.
They must fill out a form indicating their country of origin, gender and age – but are not required to give their name. A green bracelet identifies them in the shelter with a number corresponding to the registry.
THOUSANDS OF CARAVAN MIGRANTS REQUEST TEMPORARY ASYLUM IN MEXICO; SOME TRY RETURNING TO US
Here they have the option – but are not required – to officially register in Mexico and seek temporary asylum for up to one year.
This is part of a larger operation as the total number of migrants that have registered for Mexico’s new offer exceeds 12,500.
And it’s part of the new Lopez Obrador administration’s “far-reaching” approach to migration in general.
“Mexico’s position will no longer be one of migration deterrence and blockage,” writes Roberto Velasco Alvarez, spokesman for the Sec of Foreign Affairs in an op-ed for The Washington Post.
Alvarez also criticizes the U.S.’ new policy known as “Remain in Mexico” or Migrant Protection Protocols that requires migrants seeking asylum in America to wait in Mexico while their claims play out.

She insisted that, in exercising oversight authority, she is not engaging in retaliation for being disparaged as low I.Q. by the president. It has nothing to do with what he said about me, she said. Thats meaningless. Ms. Waters said she hopes to find common ground with Republicans, including on an overhaul of federal flood insurance. But her priorities, for the most part, stand in stark contrast to those of her predecessor, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, who spent the past two years pushing to water down the new rules created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and to neuter the consumer finance watchdog set up by the Obama administration. This year, Mr. Hensarling helped shepherd through a bill that relaxed some of those rules. The 2010 law, for example, established stricter regulations for banks with at least $50 billion in assets. The new legislation raised the threshold to $100 billion and instructed the Fed to consider leniencies for even larger banks. Last month, the Fed complied, proposing to divide the biggest banks into four categories. Under the proposal, only a few top-tier behemoths like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America would still be subject to the toughest rules. Under Ms. Waters, the committee which has oversight of the Fed as well as the banking industry is likely to scrutinize the Feds plans to soften regulations.","The Federal Reserve wants to relax rules for the biggest banks, but Democrats, who will take control of the House next year, say they plan to keep banks on a tight leash.",2018-11-09T22:51:58Z,A Tale of Two Washingtons Awaits Wall Street Banks,The New York Times,0

Vast stretches of the Midwest remained threatened by what the National Weather Service described late Monday as ""major to historic"" flooding, even as officials and residents were still grappling with a recent deluge that left three people dead in Iowa and Nebraska.
The flooding occurred after downpours and snow melt swelled rivers and creeks across the region last week.
Flood warnings and advisories remained in effect across the Plains, the Mississippi Valley, and parts of the Ohio Valley region on Monday, the weather agency said.
Speaking to reporters Monday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds called the floods ""catastrophic"" and ""unbelievable.""
""It was heart-wrenching to see the breadth of the flood,"" she said, recalling a flight over the Missouri River earlier.
Forty-two of Iowa's counties had declared emergencies, she said. Two-thirds of the town of Hamburg, just east of the Missouri river, was ""lost,"" she said.
Buffy Chaney, who moved there a few years ago and whose home remained underwater Monday told NBC affiliate WOWT that the experience was ""heartbreaking.""
""Just watching rescue boats go down, I mean, it's speechless,"" Chaney said. ""Devastating. Heartbreaking.""
In Nebraska, where White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Vice President Mike Pence would travel on Tuesday, that state's emergency management agency tallied the flood's financial impact at more than $265 million, according to WOWT.
In Douglas County, which includes Omaha, 200 children and adults had been rescued since Friday, WOWT reported.
At a horse stable there, it wasn't clear if 18 animals would escape the floodwaters alive, according to NBC affiliate KSNB.
The owners of Winnail Stable had to flee on Saturday before the horses could be evacuated, the station reported.
When volunteers returned with food, they found one donkey dead and the horses alive, though standing in chest-deep water, the station reported.
""We're going to make it,"" said an airboat pilot working with the stable, according to the station. ""I guarantee we'll get there.""

"April 7, 2019, 2:06 PM GMT
HANALEI, Hawaii Lyndsey Haraguchi-Nakayama is well-versed in how to rescue her familys farm from floods. After all, shes been practicing since she was 6, when she learned to drive a tractor. During evacuation drills growing up, she and her father, Rodney, would each jump on a tractor on the familys 55-acre wetland taro farm in the Hanalei Valley on the island of Kauai.
And two by two, we would take the tractors up the back of this mountain side and park it, higher from the flash-flood zone, Haraguchi-Nakayama said.
But despite her preparedness as a sixth-generation farmer and routinely encountering wet weather on the island, one of the rainiest places in the world she said little could have readied her for the torrential rain and flooding the island experienced last year when a heavy storm system pounded both Kauai and the island of Oahu, starting April 13.
According to the National Weather Service, Kauais north shore received almost 50 inches of rain, setting a new national record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period.
Harrowing images of the aftermath showed the extent of the storms damage, which included bison displaced onto the beach from a flooded ranch and houses drowning under muddy brown water.
Debris and fallen pine and albizia trees raked through the Haraguchis fields, uprooting anything recently planted, including already-delicate taro roots. Haraguchi-Nakayama and her family also incurred extensive damage to their farmhouse and nonprofit agrarian museum for the Hoopulapula Haraguchi Rice Mill, a historic mill that dates back to the 1800s, listed as the last standing rice mill in the state of Hawaii.
In the days after the floods, Haraguchi-Nakayama recalled wading through the farms office, attempting to salvage documents, photographs and artifacts. Tilapia displaced from the overflowing Hanalei River would swim by her.
Their food truck, an ancillary business, flooded. At one point, her mother, Karol, broke out into hives from mold that had crept up inside of what remained of the farmhouse. While clearing out debris that had rolled onto the taro fields, Haraguchi-Nakayama herself punctured her foot by stepping on a nail, which required a tetanus shot.
Nobody was really prepared for it. The height of that flash-flood water, the swiftness, the velocity it came down its like nothing Ive seen in my lifetime, said Haraguchi-Nakayama, who is in her 30s. Nothing in my fathers lifetime or my grandfathers either and hes 97. Everybody was caught off guard.
That includes beekeeper Mike Uncle Mike Yulo. After the first rains, Yulo raced to the farm in Kealia on the east side of the island where he kept his beehives from which he harvests to make teas and desserts that he sells at farmers markets and to local restaurants. Since his honey house was low to the ground, he anticipated it would flood and wanted to salvage as much honey as he could.
Right when I had the last bucket in my truck, I felt the water on my feet, on my knees and my hips. And then I knew. I watched my honey house wash away, Yulo, 65, said. As he started to drive away, a rush of water overwhelmed his truck, lifting it up from behind and forcing it into an irrigation ditch. Yulo crawled out of his trucks window to escape and grabbed onto a bucket of honey, using it as a buoy until he could safely get to higher ground. The whole ordeal happened within 15 to 20 minutes, he said.
Not far away and on the same farm in Kealia, Christy Wong and her husband, Keola, scrambled to save the animals at their Kauai Animal Education Center, an animal sanctuary frequented by local school children. Wong said she watched in horror as one structure on the property flipped over, trapping baby goats and sheep. In all, the center lost 46 of the 157 animals in its care.
The reality of what happened opened a lot of people's eyes up to, Whoa, this can happen, this will happen, and how are we going to fix it? Wong said of the communitys effort to clear roadways, help those scrambling for housing, and even wrangle lost bison. Nobody waited for the Coast Guard or federal funding. My family was down there doing it.
An incremental recovery
According to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, last April's floods caused an estimated $20 million in damage to public properties and more than 500 homes were affected. On May 8, 2018, President Donald Trump approved federal disaster assistance funding via the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help state and local efforts.
But an initial count of damaged homes did not meet FEMAs threshold to allow Kauai residents to apply for individual assistance funds from the agency, prompting Hawaii Gov. David Ige to write a five-page letter to the agency with an updated count on homes affected in both Kauai and Honolulu counties on June 13, two months after the floods had occurred.
Between both islands, the letter stated, 760 homes were affected, with 176 incurring major damage; 72 were on Kauai. On June 27, residents whose primary home was affected could apply for individual and household assistance funds. To date, FEMA has approved more than $1.5 million in individual and household assistance for Kauai and Honolulu counties.

In the days and weeks that followed, communities islandwide implemented a grassroots all-hands-on-deck strategy, with local organizations and nonprofits banding together to provide housing and food assistance. Organizations like the Kauai County Farm Bureau set up an information center for local farmers to find out how to apply for loans and access donated funds. The efforts, Kauai County Mayor Derek Kawakami said were heartening. But it also highlighted deficiencies in the islands emergency response.
Weve identified areas, of course, where we need to improve. One, we just have to have a clear channel of communication between government and nongovernmental organizations, said Kawakami, who was elected last November,
He added that there was also a recognized need to have mental health experts available immediately because of the stress that families encounter during disasters like the flooding. We need to have that counselor out there talking to our children, talking to those families that have lost everything, he said.
For residents like Lanae Anakalea, applying and waiting for federal funds felt like too overwhelming a process especially when she was looking for immediate housing for her and her family, which includes two young children, 5 and 8.
It wasnt like our house flooded, and the floodwaters went away and we were at home. We were bouncing around for six weeks trying to figure out what to do with our kids and still work, Anakalea said.

She and her family live in Wainiha, a residential community on the northwest coast of Kauai that continues to be impacted because of repairs to Kuhio Highway, a main vein that connects the southeast and northwest parts of the island.
Areas of the highway near the most northwestern communities of Wainiha, Waipa and Haena were especially hit hard. To facilitate ongoing repairs, the Hawaii Department of Transportation instituted a convoy schedule in November, designating when residents can travel to and from the area, which is still restricted to residents only.
According to HDOT Deputy Director of Highways Ed Sniffen, significant challenges to repairing the road which experienced some 14 landslides include the damage incurred by three bridges (Waikoko, Waipa and Wailoli) that had to be repaired in order for vehicles to transport heavy construction materials. In all, Sniffen said, Kuhio Highway will undergo some $80 million worth of repairs, 90 percent of which is federally funded.","""Nobody was really prepared for it.

"The Italian government, a coalition between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right wing Lega, is trying to finance welfare programs as a solution to economic stagnation. But its spending would produce a deficit considered dangerously high for a country with so much debt. In letters to the European Commission late Tuesday, Giovanni Tria, the Italian finance minister, promised to speed up the sale of state assets to help reduce government debt. Otherwise, he made only minor changes to a budget that the commission had rejected. The spending is limited to what is strictly necessary to counteract the slowing of the economic cycle, Mr. Tria wrote. And he said some of the outlays were justified by emergencies, including flood damage and investment in roads and other infrastructure after a deadly bridge collapse in Genoa. The European Commission will issue an opinion by next Wednesday, a spokesman said. What happens after that is uncertain. Officials in Brussels will try to walk a fine line, enforcing European Union rules while avoiding a war of words with Rome that would play into the hands of populists. The commission could penalize Italy by imposing fines or withholding European Union funds for economic development. But the commission rarely moves quickly. The big risk is that investors will lose confidence in Italy and no longer buy government bonds at interest rates the government can afford, a development that would ripple through the economy. The risk premium on Italian bonds spiked early Wednesday, though it later retreated. The International Monetary Fund said the stimulus would be futile unless paired with measures to improve the functioning of the economy such as dismantling rules that make it costly for businesses to fire workers. Without such changes, the I.M.F. said in a report on Monday, the spending plan could backfire. Italy could be forced into a large fiscal consolidation when the economy is weakening, I.M.F. economists wrote. This could transform a slowdown into a recession.",The Continent faces a confluence of economic and political crises after Germany’s growth disappointed and Italy defied calls to modify a populist budget plan.,2018-11-14T20:50:12Z,"German Economy Shrinks Unexpectedly, Adding to Europe’s Risk",The New York Times,0
"Caracas, Venezuela — Millions of demonstrators are expected to flood the streets of Venezuela's capital on Saturday. Students are hard at work, making signs for what's shaping up to be the mother of all protest marches. 
""We are really scared to go to the streets but we know this time it's something really worth fighting for,"" said Ana Ferreira, a student leader. 
They are fighting to force President Nicolas Maduro out of office. But his rival and interim replacement, Juan Guaido, warns it won't be easy. Dictatorships don't give up without a fight, he said. 
Just this week, 70 people have been killed, most of them very young. 
Alixon dos Santos was one of the victims. At 19-years-old, he joined tens of thousands of Venezuelans protesting against Maduro last Saturday.
Things got ugly and government forces started shooting. Alixon died from a single bullet, and he was buried by neighbors and family on Tuesday. 
Nivea, his step-mother, is keeping a shrine to his memory in their tiny apartment. Alixon died protesting against Maduro, she said, but the fight has to go on. Her other son will be among the protesters this weekend.

"Dr. Hu may be the first third-generation (in terms of scientific pedigree) Ig Nobel winner, because Dr. Mahadevan studied under the late Joseph Keller, a mathematician at Stanford University. Dr. Keller won two Ig Nobels. One was for studying why ponytails swing from side-to-side, rather than up and down, when the ponytail owner is jogging. The other was an examination of why teapots dribble. After M.I.T., Dr. Hu did research at the Courant Institute at New York University, another hotbed of real-world mathematics. He moved to Georgia Tech, after Jeannette Yen, a biologist there, told the university they ought to take a look at him. Dr. Hus research may seem like pure fun, but much of it is built on the idea that how animals move and function can provide inspiration for engineers designing human-made objects or systems. The title of Dr. Hus book refers to the robots of the future, and he emphasizes the way animal motion offers insights that can be applied to engineering Bio-inspired design. When Brazils Pantanal wetlands flood, for instance, fire ants form rafts so tightly interlaced that water doesnt penetrate their mass. When he picked up such a mass in the lab, Dr. Hu writes, it felt like a pile of salad greens. The raft was springy, and if I squeezed it down to a fraction of its height, it recoiled back to its original shape. If I pulled it apart, it stretched like cheese on a pizza. He found out that the ants were constantly moving even though the shape of the mass stayed more or less the same. They were breaking and making connections all the time, and they became, in essence, a self-healing material.","David Hu is an associate professor of mechanical engineering and biology at Georgia Tech, where he studies the biomechanics of animal locomotion, like the slithering of snakes or the flicking of frog tongues.",2018-11-05T16:22:04Z,The Mysteries of Animal Movement,The New York Times,0
"Some 40,000 homes could be left ""unsold"" for each month the government shutdown lasts, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). And in its latest monthly housing report, the NAR predicted ""slower economic growth"" if employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) remain off the job, unable to approve the flood insurance that can be key to home sales.
""Unlike past government shutdowns, with this present closure, flood insurance is not available,"" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. ""That means roughly 40,000 homes per month may go unsold.""
The housing dilemma is due to a FEMA announcement that will primarily affect Florida, Louisiana and Texas. FEMA said it will no longer sell new flood insurance policies through private insurers ""due to the lapse in appropriations"" for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that it runs. The NFIP funds most of the 5 million flood insurance policies issued in the U.S., and more than half are in those three southern coastal states.
Prior shutdowns of the flood insurance program were due to Congressional failure to reauthorize the NFIP. This caused widespread economic lossed throughout the South's real estate markets before it was eventually reactivated. Banks will not approve mortgages for potential buyers who want to purchase homes in flood-prone areas defined by FEMA maps, both in coastal locations and along rivers and streams. It will also be difficult for home builders to obtain construction permits for businesses and residences.
Trump ""willing to negotiate"" on border wall, Sarah Sanders says
But just before Christmas, Congress specifically authorized an extension of the NFIP until May 31 and President Trump signed the legislation. Then on Dec. 27, FEMA issued a statement saying it could not process policies due to the fees given to private insurers that handled them.
These fees are ""an impermissible funding obligation during a lapse of annual appropriations,"" FEMA said in a statement on its website, which is now shuttered due to a ""lapse in federal funding."" FEMA is not responding to either calls or emails.
FEMA's move was labeled unnecessary by congressional members and business leaders. ""By refusing to renew or sell flood insurance … FEMA is not only thwarting congressional intent, but also hurting countless homeowners across the nation who reside in flood-prone areas,"" said Randy Noel, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, a Washington D.C.-based trade association. Thousands of building permits for both homes and businesses could be affected if the problem persists, according to one estimate by an insurer.
But others view the move as having limited effect at a time when the real estate market is at its lowest point in the year -- unless the government shutdown continues well into january. ""December is typically a slow month for home sales in most parts of the country,"" said Lynne McChristian, a representative of the Insurance Information Institute, which provides data to home insurers. ""Real estate, however, is all about location. And what makes a location attractive in January is a warm climate by the coast.""
McChristian also said that the NFIP is not the only way to obtain flood insurance. ""Prospective buyers have options in the private flood insurance market now and many private insurers offer flood insurance at comparable prices that may also be more comprehensive.""
Day 5 of the partial government shutdown
Chief Executive Craig Poulton of private insurer Poulton Associates predicted that ""we will see a rush of applications, and so will other private insurers."" He claimed his company could offer a quote to more than half of them.
He also said the FEMA move was somewhat bogus. ""FEMA could turn on the NFIP spigot right now,"" he suggested. ""These FEMA people will get paid when the government goes back to work. What FEMA is saying is that it's not important enough for these people to go to work.""
FEMA itself said in its statement that it was ""currently reviewing all legal authorities that would allow the NFIP to continue operations without interruption.""
Some consumer representatives suggest it may be time to get rid of the NFIP altogether, since it funds homes and businesses that perennially flood and have to be refunded, putting the program nearly $21 billion in debt.
""FEMA is always behind with its mapping process for flood zones. With all the GPS technology it could be done much faster,"" said Amy Bach, executive director of consumer group United Policyholders.
""Ending the FEMA flood insurance program would be a good thing for many reasons,"" said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. ""But not in this fashion.""","A prolonged shutdown of FEMA's flood insurance could leave up to 40,000 homes unsold per month, real estate group warns",2018-12-28T18:25:54Z,A prolonged shutdown could stall home sales,CBS News,0

"Most Nebraskans don't have flood insurance, with less than 10,000 policies issued for its nearly 2 million residents
Federal flood maps are woefully outdated, leaving many unaware they even need this type of insurance 
Meat prices nationwide could increase due to shortages
Farm bankruptcies were already on the rise in the now flood-ravaged Midwest
As rampaging rivers continue to rise in the upper Midwest, destroying bridges and roads and isolating farming communities, the cost has already risen to more than a half-billion dollars. And it will probably total at least twice as much. 
""The price tag for the catastrophic flooding in Nebraska and other parts of the Midwest will likely be over $1 billion when agricultural losses are included,"" warns Sarah Pralle, a political science professor at Syracuse University who specializes in environmental issues.
The losses will be worse for homeowners and farmers because most lack flood insurance. In the hardest-hit state of Nebraska, less than 10,000 policies are in effect statewide for its nearly 2 million residents, according to spokesperson Loretta Worters of the Insurance Information Institute, which represents property-casualty insurers. ""They will face devastating losses,"" predicted Pralle.
One reason for the lack of coverage is that federal flood maps are woefully outdated. Many residents in states like Nebraska are unaware they even need this type of insurance. ""These outdated maps do not reflect real estate development and the climate change that is producing more intense storms,"" said Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. ""By allowing developers to do whatever they want, almost every community acts in ways that delay implementation of new maps.""
Meat prices are rising already
Such an approach could end up hurting not only Nebraskans, but consumers all across the country. That's because they'll have to pay more for food, particularly meat. Prices for hogs and cattle rose Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Agriculture contributes more than $25 billion to Nebraska's economy, and the state ranks fourth in the nation in meat production. But many herds have been almost completely obliterated. And it will be impossible to get the remaining cattle and hogs to market until impassable roads and bridges are repaired. Nebraska's Governor Pete Ricketts described the damage as the most widespread in the state's history. 
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts on response to worst flooding in state's history
Certain losses could be covered under farm insurance policies, but they're very specific. They may not cover grain that isn't stored in a silo or a power outage for the refrigeration needed on a dairy farm. Many farmers have federally subsidized crop insurance. But the problem is that under these policies, they'll have to work extremely fast to make sure their seeds are planted by a certain time, said Worters. And that could prove impossible if fields remain flooded.
""Record bankruptcies""
Many Nebraska farmers are already at a disadvantage because they're close to the financial breaking point. According to former North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, there are ""record bankruptcies in the farming country"" of the upper Midwest. These farmers are already reeling from setbacks, including a tariff war as other nations respond to higher U.S. tariffs with tariffs of their own on imported U.S. agricultural products.

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bankers in Asia are betting on newly-listed companies returning to the markets for fresh capital as last year’s flood of initial public offerings (IPOs) slows to a trickle, with 2019 seeing the weakest start in equity sales in three years. 
Equity sales in the region, including IPOs, convertible bonds and follow-on sales, fell 41 percent to $49.1 billion in the first quarter, Refinitiv data show, the slowest since 2016. 
Fees from equity capital market (ECM) deals have reached $966 million so far, bankers’ worst quarterly haul in six years. 
The data make for a sobering read after 2018 when Asia’s red-hot markets hosted many multi-billion dollar IPOs, including SoftBank Corp’s $23.6 billion Tokyo float and Xiaomi’s $5.4 billion one in Hong Kong. 
But bankers hope some of the gloom will be lifted as many of the companies that went public last year return for additional capital, making 2019 less a year of jumbo IPOs and more of follow-on capital raisings and convertible bonds. 
“We are already seeing companies that went public last year coming back ... with follow-on offerings,” said Goldman Sachs’ David Binnion, co-head of equity capital markets, Asia ex-Japan. 
“In many situations these follow-on financings are coming sooner after listing than we have historically seen, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of these growth companies.” 
Many firms that went public last year raised less than they had aimed for as investors pushed back against lofty valuations. 
That will further drive follow-on activity, bankers said. 
Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, video streaming company iQIYI and e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, all 2018 IPOs, have come back to the market to raise funds. 
NIO raised $750 million in a five-year convertible bond this year, four months after it went public in New York, while iQIYI raised $1.1 billion in six-year convertible bonds this week in its second such issue within a year of its IPO. 
Pinduoduo raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on offering in February, the fourth-largest ECM transaction this quarter. 
Asian companies have sold $21.3 billion in convertible bonds so far, a record for this point in any year. 
(Graphic: Asia ECM fees since 2013 - tmsnrt.rs/2HJU9NG) 
IPO SLOWDOWN 
After a blockbuster IPO year for Asia in 2018, led by Hong Kong that hosted deals worth $36.3 billion - its best year in eight - 2019 is expected to be much slower. 
“Some drivers of last year, such as mega IPOs out of China will probably be fewer,” said Murli Maiya, co-head of investment banking coverage for Asia Pacific for JPMorgan. 
“There should be continued investor interest in IPOs, but likely at different price points and in different sectors.” 
Hong Kong’s largest IPOs this year are likely to be from non-Chinese firms such as UK data centre operator Global Switch, which plans to raise $1 billion, and a spin-off of the Asian interests of the world’s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, which could raise over $5 billion, sources say. 
The largest IPO in Asia this year so far was the $687 million float of Embassy Office Parks REIT in India, the country’s first real estate investment trust IPO.

But bankers are optimistic the good performance of smaller IPOs, such as CStone Pharmaceuticals and Chinese broker Futu Holdings, will give investors confidence after the bleak performance of many newly-listed shares in 2018. 
Despite the headline-grabbing amounts raised in IPOs last year, many companies languished below their offer prices with Sino-U.S. trade tensions keeping investors on tenterhooks.

"OMAHA, Neb. The Latest on flooding in the Midwest (all times local):
10 a.m.
The president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau says farm and ranch losses due to the devastating flooding could reach $1 billion in the state.
Steve Nelson estimates $400 million in crop losses because of crops that will be planted late, if at all. He also estimates as much as $500 million in livestock losses as Nebraska and other Midwestern states struggle with swollen rivers and breached levees following heavy rain and snowmelt.
Nelson tells the Omaha World-Herald that he wouldn't be surprised if ""lost agriculture numbers go over a billion dollars.""
Agriculture amounts to 20 percent of Nebraska's gross domestic product and provides one of every four jobs in the state.
Nelson says flooding is costing the state's cattle industry $1 million a day in costs that usually aren't covered by insurance.

Vice President Mike Pence is headed to the Midwest to view flood damage as farmers raise concerns that busted levees won't be fixed before the traditional spring flood season.
Pence is scheduled to visit Omaha, Nebraska, late Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds of homes are damaged, and tens of thousands of acres are inundated with water.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says rivers breached at least a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. Flooding is expected through the week as high water levels flow down the Missouri River.
Corps official Jud Kneuvean says levees usually take six months to repair. That means most likely won't be fixed by mid-May, the start of the most flood-prone part of the year.
The Nebraska Farm Bureau says farm and ranch losses could reach $1 billion in Nebraska alone.","The Latest: Farm, ranch losses from flooding could top $1B Fox News Satellite images show the devastating floods in the Midwest Washington Post Vice President Pence To Visit Nebraska Amid Record Floods NPR Pence heads to flooded Midwest amid concerns about le…",2019-03-19T15:22:11Z,"The Latest: Farm, ranch losses from flooding could top $1B - Fox News",Fox News,1
"GHORAMARA ISLAND, India (Reuters) - Residents of India’s Ghoramara Island want to leave their home as it shrinks each year due to rising seas, but many say they can’t afford it. The 4.6 sq km (1.8 sq mile) island, part of the Sundarbans delta on the Bay of Bengal, has nearly halved in size over the past two decades, according to village elders. The tiny island is home to 4,800 people, down from 7,000 a decade ago. “If a tsunami or a big cyclone hits this island we will be finished,” said Sanjib Sagar, village leader on the island 150 km (93 miles) south of the Indian city of Kolkata. (To see picture package, click on reut.rs/2TRX5dZ ) The Sundarbans, shared by India and Bangladesh, include the world’s largest mangrove forest as well as rare or endangered tigers, dolphins, birds and reptiles. Ghoramara is among many islands in the delta affected by rising sea levels and soil erosion experts say is caused by climate change. Residents say the flood waters are getting worse, threatening their homes and livelihoods. “If government gives rehabilitation I will leave,” said Sheikh Aftab Uddin, sitting outside his new mud house with his wife, after his previous home was destroyed by flood waters. Half of the villagers are ready to move if the government provided free land in a safer area, Sagar said, but there has been no response to their request for compensation or to move people off the island. Two people in the office of Javed Ahmed Khan, the minister in charge of disaster management in the state government of West Bengal, declined to comment on whether it had any plans to relocate inhabitants. Floods have churned the island’s shoreline into mud fringed with broken coconut palms. Fishermen cast their nets to try to take advantage of the rising waters. As well as damaging homes, floods destroy valuable betel leaf crops that many islanders have depended on for a living. “Every year, high-tide salt water enters my farm and destroys my cultivation, so I have to face a big loss,” said Mihir Kumar Mondal, a betel leaf farmer. Climate change experts say the entire island population will have to be relocated one day. “There has to be some planning for those people, in terms of relocating them to other areas. Frankly speaking, this has to be in the plan of the government,” said Suruchi Bhadwal, a researcher on climate change at the New Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of listed Chinese companies - from hog farmers struggling to buy pig feed, to glassware makers unable to collect receivables - flagged big losses for 2018, victim to a slowing economy and Beijing’s deleveraging. 
Once-acquisitive companies, who paid top dollar for assets during the boom years, are being forced to take heavy write-downs that are weighing on their balance sheets already weakened by a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war. 
As of Wednesday, 129 companies estimated losses in excess of 800 million yuan ($119.3 million) each for 2018, the Shanghai Securities News reported. Nearly 200 others flagged losses of over 100 million yuan each. 
China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year, as ramped-up deleveraging efforts to curb shadow banking triggered a funding squeeze among smaller firms and choked the private sector. 
Economic growth is expected to ease further this year. 
The benchmark Shanghai Composite index has fallen more than a quarter in the past 12 months. 
“The economy was already cooling, and suddenly we had the trade war, which is why we’re seeing so many earnings implosions,” said Yang Hongxun, an analyst with investment consultancy Shandong Shenguang. 
“But it’s possible some companies are using the bad year for an accounting big bath, so future results will look better.” 
Robin Xing, Morgan Stanley’s chief China economist, said he was optimistic on Chinese stocks in 2019, betting that recent measures, including tax cuts, infrastructure investment and looser monetary conditions, will help stabilize growth. 
Chinese companies are rushing to post profit warnings ahead of a regulatory deadline at the end of January. 
Chuying Agro-Pastoral Group Co, which breeds pigs and poultry, said late on Wednesday that it will swing to a loss of 2.9-3.3 billion yuan in 2018, compared with a profit of 45 million yuan a year earlier. 
The company said some pigs starved to death because they did not have the cash to buy feed on time. Asset and goodwill impairment write-downs also contributed to the loss, it said. 
An estimated 1.45 trillion yuan ($216.17 billion) of goodwill impairment is sitting on the books of listed Chinese companies, threatening to worsen troubles of many firms already struggling to make margin calls. 
Some firms, including gaming company Dalian Zeus Entertainment Co and Kaidi Ecological, forecast annual losses that exceed their market value.

"Threatening drastic action against Mexico, President Donald Trump declared he is likely to shut down America's southern border next week unless Mexican authorities immediately halt all illegal immigration. Such a severe move could hit the economies of both countries, but the president emphasized, ""I am not kidding around.""
""It could mean all trade"" with Mexico, Trump said when questioned Friday by reporters in Florida. ""We will close it for a long time.""
Trump has been promising for more than two years to build a long, impenetrable wall along the border to stop illegal immigration, though Congress has been reluctant to provide the money he needs. In the meantime, he has repeatedly threatened to close the border, but this time, with a new surge of migrants heading north , he gave a definite timetable.
A substantial closure could have an especially heavy impact on cross-border communities from San Diego to South Texas, as well as supermarkets that sell Mexican produce, factories that rely on imported parts, and other businesses across the U.S.
The U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said closing the border would be ""an unmitigated economic debacle"" that would threaten 5 million American jobs.
Trump tweeted Friday morning, ""If Mexico doesn't immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.""
He didn't qualify his threat with ""or large sections,"" stating: ""There is a very good likelihood I'll be closing the border next week, and that is just fine with me.""
He said several times that it would be ""so easy"" for Mexican authorities to stop immigrants passing through their country and trying to enter the U.S. illegally, ""but they just take our money and 'talk.'""
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen suggested Trump was referring to the ongoing surge of mostly Central American families heading north through Mexico. Many people who cross the border illegally ultimately request asylum under U.S. law, which does not require asylum seekers to enter at an official crossing.
Short of a widespread shutdown, Nielsen said the U.S. might close designated ports of entry to re-deploy staff to help process parents and children. Ports of entry are official crossing points that are used by residents and commercial vehicles.
""If we have to close ports to take care of all of the numbers who are coming, we will do that,"" Nielsen said. ""So it's on the table, but what we're doing is a very structured process based on operational needs.""
The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether Trump's possible action would apply to air travel.
Trump's latest declaration came after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country was doing its part to fight migrant smuggling. Criminal networks charge thousands of dollars a person to move migrants through Mexico, increasingly in large groups toward remote sections of the border.
""We want to have a good relationship with the government of the United States,"" Lopez Obrador said Friday. He added: ""We are going to continue helping so that the migratory flow, those who pass through our country, do so according to the law, in an orderly way.""
Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, tweeted that his country ""doesn't act based on threats"" and is ""the best neighbor"" the U.S. could have.
Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that 750 border inspectors would be reassigned to deal with the growing number of migrant families.
In Florida, Trump was also asked about the two migrant children who died in U.S. custody in December. Is the administration equipped to handle sick children who are detained?
""I think that it has been very well stated that we have done a fantastic job,"" he said, defending Border Patrol efforts to help the children.
Trump said that in one of the cases ""the father gave the child no water for a long period of time,"" although an autopsy released Friday made no mention of dehydration.
""It was a very tough situation and that trek up, that's a long hard trek,"" he said. ""It's a horrible situation. But Mexico could stop it.""
Democratic and Republican lawmakers have fought over Trump's contention that there is a ""crisis"" at the border, particularly amid his push for a border wall. He claims a wall would solve immigration problems, though it wouldn't keep out families who cross at official points so they can surrender and be detained.
The president called on Congress to immediately change what he said were weak U.S. immigration laws, which he blamed on Democrats. The Department of Homeland Security wants the authority to detain families for longer and more quickly deport children from Central America who arrive at the border on their own. The department argues those policy changes would stop families from trying to enter the U.S.
Alejandra Mier y Teran, executive director of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce in San Diego, said the mere threat of border closures sends the wrong message to businesses in Mexico and may eventually scare companies into turning to Asia for their supply chains.
""I think the impact would be absolutely devastating on so many fronts,"" said Mier y Teran, whose members rely on the Otay Mesa crossing to bring televisions, medical devices and a wide range of products to the U.S. ""In terms of a long-term effect, it's basically shooting yourself in your foot. It's sending out a message to other countries that, 'Don't come because our borders may not work at any time.' That is extremely scary and dangerous.""

"WINSLOW, Neb./CHICAGO, March 20 (Reuters) - Midwestern farmers have been gambling they could ride out the U.S.-China trade war by storing their corn and soybeans anywhere they could - in bins, plastic tubes, in barns or even outside. 
Now, the unthinkable has happened. Record floods have devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt across Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and several other states. Early estimates of lost crops and livestock are approaching $1 billion in Nebraska alone. With more flooding expected, damages are expected to climb much higher for the region. 
As river levels rose, spilling over levees and swallowing up townships, farmers watched helplessly as the waters consumed not only their fields, but their stockpiles of grain, the one thing that can stand between them and financial ruin. 
“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” said Tom Geisler, a farmer in Winslow, Nebraska, who said he lost two full storage bins of corn. “We had been depending on the income from our livestock, but now all of our feed is gone, so that is going to be even more difficult. We haven’t been making any money from our grain farming because of trade issues and low prices.” 
The pain does not end there. As the waters began to recede in parts of Nebraska, the damage to the rural roads, bridges and rail lines was just beginning to emerge. This infrastructure is critical for the U.S. agricultural sector to move products from farms to processing plants and shipping hubs. 
The damage to roads means it will be harder for trucks to deliver seed to farmers for the coming planting season, but in some areas, the flooding on fields will render them all-but-impossible to use. 
The deluge is the latest blow for the Farm Belt, which has faced several crises in the last five years, as farm incomes have fallen by more than 50 percent due to a global grain glut. President Donald Trump’s trade policies cut off exports of soybeans and other products, making the situation worse. 
Soybeans were the single most valuable U.S. agricultural export crop and until the trade war, China bought $12 billion worth a year from American farmers. But Chinese tariffs have almost halted the trade, leaving farmers with crops they are struggling to sell for a profit. 
CORN AND SOYBEANS DESTROYED 
As prices plummeted last year amid the ongoing trade fight, growers, faced with selling crops at a loss, stuffed a historic volume of grain into winding plastic tubes and steel bins. Some cash-strapped families piled crops inside their barns or outside on the ground. 
Farmers say they are now finding storage bags torn and bins burst open, grain washed away or contaminated. Jeff Jorgenson, a farmer and regional director for the Iowa Soybean Association, said he has seen at least a dozen bins that burst after grains swelled when they became wet. 
Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration policy, flood-soaked grain is considered adulterated and must be destroyed, according to Iowa State University. 
Some farmers had been waiting for corn prices to rise just 10 cents a bushel more before making sales, which would earn them a few extra thousand dollars, Jorgenson said. 
“That’s the toughest pill to swallow,” Jorgenson said. “This could end their career of farming and the legacy of the family farm.” 
As of Dec. 1, producers in states with flooding - including South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin and Illinois - had 6.75 billion bushels of corn, soybeans and wheat stored on their farms - 38 percent of the total U.S. supplies available at that time, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
Iowa suffered at least $150 million in damage to agricultural buildings and machinery, and 100,000 acres of farm land are under water, said Keely Coppess, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. 
EXTENT OF DAMAGE UNCLEAR 
The record flooding has killed at least four people in the Midwest and left one person missing. The extent of damage is unknown as meteorologists expect more flooding in coming weeks. 
Early estimates put flood damage at $400 million in losses for Nebraska’s cow-calf industry and another $440 million in crop losses, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts told a news conference on Wednesday. 
“The water came so fast,” said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. “We know our farmers didn’t have enough time to move all the cattle or empty all their grain bins.” 
Multiple washouts and high water on BNSF Railway Co’s main lines have caused major disruption across parts of the Midwest, the company warned on its website. The flooding also has disrupted part of Hormel Foods Corp’s supply chain, the company told Reuters. 
The roads are so bad that Nebraska’s National Guard on Wednesday will push hay out of a military helicopter to feed cattle in Colfax County stranded by floodwaters, Major General Daryl Bohac said. It is the first time in at least half a century that such an air drop has been conducted, he said. 
Cattle carcasses have been found tangled in debris or rotting in trees, while tractors and other expensive machinery are stuck in mud, unable to be moved. 
“We should have been getting into planting for next season, but now all of our equipment is flooded and it’s going to take at least three to four weeks to bring back that equipment into shape,” said Geisler, the farmer in Winslow, Nebraska.

"One evening in April 2005, Raven Abaroa said he was out playing soccer when he returned to his familys North Carolina home to discover a horrifying scene.
He told police he found his wife, 25-year-old Janet Abaroa, stabbed to death in an upstairs bedroom. Nothing else in the house was disturbed, according to authorities, and the couples 6-month-old son, Kaiden, was left unharmed in another room.
""She's been shot or something. There's blood everywhere,"" Raven Abaroa told a 911 dispatcher at the time.
Who killed Janet Abaroa was a mystery that captivated the Durham, North Carolina, suburbs, and the case remained unsolved for years.
ABC News first aired an investigative report about the cold case in 2009 and has been following the case for the past 10 years. Concurrently, a Durham Police Det. Charles Sole was assigned to review the evidence again.
Watch the full story on ""20/20"" THIS FRIDAY, March 29 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.
Love found on the soccer field
Janet Christiansen, the seventh of 10 siblings, grew up in a Mormon family. She met Raven Abaroa, also a Mormon, in 1998 at Southern Virginia University, where she played soccer. He was a fellow soccer player who instantly swept her off her feet.
""She was beautiful, attractive. ... I just felt so much comfort when I was with her,"" Raven Abaroa said in an interview with the local TV show ""NC Wanted"" in 2007, and that was later posted online by the Raleigh-based TV station WRAL. ""And we started this journey of getting to know each other and it was an amazing journey.""
In August 2000, after two years together, Janet and Raven Abaroa married at the Mormon temple in Washington, D.C. They settled in southeastern Virginia, her friends and family thought that life for the newlywed couple was perfect.
Soon after their wedding, a job opportunity moved the couple to Durham, North Carolina, where they both took positions at a sporting goods company. Janet Abaroa's sisters told ABC News that at the time, the couple was beginning to have some marital problems.
The Abaroas welcome a son
""He came to her one day because he wanted to be out of the marriage,"" said Sonja Flood, Janet Abaroa's sister. ""And explained to her that he had been cheating on her with several different people. And very soon after that, she found out that she was pregnant.""
It should have been the happiest time of Janet and Raven Abaroa's lives, but instead Janet Abaroa confided in her family that she felt helpless. Her older sister, Dena Kendall, told 20/20 that Janet ""didn't want to raise the baby as a single mother.""
But, it seemed to friends and family that the young couple worked things out and welcomed their son Kaiden on Oct. 17, 2004.
""He promised, swore up and down, that he would no longer cheat on her, that she was the only one for him. He would make it work,"" Flood said.
With the birth of their baby boy, the Abaroas' marriage seemed to be on the mend, until they suffered yet another blow: Raven Abaroa was caught stealing from the sports apparel company where they both worked in December 2004.
Mortified, Janet Abaroa resigned from her job. He eventually pleaded guilty to five charges of embezzlement, but would avoid serving any jail time.
911 call: 'My wife Is dead'
On April 26, 2005, Raven Abaroa said his wife had been getting ready for bed around 8 p.m. when he left to play soccer with friends, according to the account he gave police about that night. He said he returned home after 10 p.m. and found Janet Abaroas body with multiple stab wounds.
In a 911 call, Raven Abaroa told the operator, ""My wife is dead ... She's been shot -- there's blood everywhere,"" he said. ""She's not breathing.""
Although Abaroa said his wife had been shot, Durham Police quickly realized that she had been stabbed.
Shortly after his wife's death, Raven Abaroa moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, with their son. There, he eventually met Vanessa Pond, a single mother whose daughter was in the same day care program as Abaroas son Kaiden.
""He [Raven] seemed very up front ... very honest and genuine, Vanessa Pond said. And I found out that he was a single father. And I really, really admired that.""
They started dating and Pond told 20/20 that Abaroa mentioned his wife had died. She said she felt ""so sorry for him ... and Kaiden."" They decided to move in together.
Sisters reach out to new wife: 'We were fearful for her'
Pond went online to find out more about the death of Raven Abaroa's first wife. She told ABC News at the time she wasn't convinced Raven Abaroa was innocent, but after asking him questions, she said he removed any and every doubt from my mind.
""He had his stories about how people were trying to frame him, about how horrible the cops were and how he continued to try to contact the police to find out what's going on,"" said Pond.
In summer 2008, three years after Janet Abaroas death was still unsolved, Pond and Raven Abaroa were married in the backyard of her parents' home.
When Janet Abaroa's sisters learned he was engaged, they said they felt they had to reach out to his new fiancee.
""We just wanted her to make sure she was aware of the things that had been in the news about him. That she would know what she was getting into. And that we were fearful for her,"" said Janet's sister Dena Kendall.
""I was heartbroken,"" Pond said. ""I [did] not want to believe at all ... that he had done this.""
Not long after, Pond said Raven Abaroa began acting in ways she didn't understand.
""Within moments, he could switch. He could say the most horrible things,"" Pond said. ""And then moments later, he would apologize.""
The outbursts, Pond said, became physical.
""He grabbed me from the door and threw me up against the wall, and then I fell,"" Pond said. ""Later, he tried to convince me that I had tripped.""
Raven Abaroa denied he was ever physically abusive to Pond.
A new detective is assigned to Janet Abaroas case
Just four months into their marriage, Pond said she feared for her safety. The couple separated and the marriage was annulled. Pond went public in spring 2009 with her fears that he killed his first wife.
The Durham Police assigned a new detective to Janet Abaroa's case Sole.
""Raven never kept the lies straight,"" Sole told ""20/20. ""His statements to law enforcement, initially, they were contradictory.""
Then, as he was reviewing the crime scene photos, Sole said something stuck out to him as odd.
I noticed the contact case on the counter with the top off of it indicating to me that the like-, likelihood that the contacts were probably not in there, which would be contrary to her going to bed or, as Raven said, in the bed going to sleep, Sole said.
When police interviewed Janet Abaroas family and friends, Sole said they told them Janet Abaroa was consistent with removing her contacts before going to sleep. He said he found this detail suspicious.
Then the next thing, Sole said, is not seeing any disturbance based on the manner of her death. A stabbing. I mean, is not immediate. Its usually violent, [with] struggling, [a] disturbance.
Raven Abaroa was arrested on Feb. 1, 2010, and charged with first-degree murder in the death of his first wife.
In July 2010, Janet Abaroas body was exhumed and authorities determined that she had been wearing contacts when she was buried.
After I received these fragments and I then cleaned them I think washed them with sterile water to get a better view, said Dr. Charles Zwerling, an ophthalmologist, who examined the remains. The material actually swelled from the water and resumed a convex shape typical of your contact lens. But, the key finding was finding the numbers 123 on sample A. This was conclusive evidence that this was an Acuvue contact lens.
In order to demonstrate how a contact lens decays over a period of time if it were buried with a body Zwerling conducted a recreation using sets of pig eyes in three separate boxes.
I applied the contact lens, said Zwerling. I applied a lens cap, which is done at your funeral home. I used the same solutions even the same linen. And I got these little caskets, these wooden boxes. And I put the pig eyes in them and buried them actually in my backyard. And then after six months, I exhumed the first box, and so forth.
The final analysis showed that the contact lenses did change just like the one we discovered, he added. Apparently, this evidence was crucial in determining a flaw in Raven Abaroa's story.
Raven Abaroa goes to trial and faces his second wife in court
During his trial, which began in 2013, prosecutors presented Raven Abaroa as a controlling husband.
Pond, who testified as a witness for the prosecution, detailed how she saw Raven Abaroa become violent on the soccer field and how his aggression turned on her.
""When he sees weakness, he just comes at you harder and harder,"" Pond said in court. ""He told me how much he hated me and how much it didn't matter if I died.""
Abaroas defense team argued that the prosecutions evidence against their client was mostly circumstantial and police had ignored evidence, including a bloody shoe print, that they said could have pointed to a different killer.
In May 2013, the jury failed to reach a verdict, deadlocking 11-1 on a guilty verdict and the judge declared a mistrial.
Before Raven Abaroas second trial was supposed to begin in March 2014, he entered an Alford plea for voluntary manslaughter, acknowledging that there was evidence to convict, him but not admitting guilt.
""I was shocked. But ... more than that, I was shocked at what the plea deal turned out to be,"" Pond said. ""That's not justice at all. It's not justice.""
A judge sentenced him to between 95 and 123 months in jail, but he was granted credit for the four years he had spent behind bars before and during his trial, which was applied as time-served.
Raven Abaroa did not testify at his trial, but he spoke in court in 2014 after being sentenced.
""I would just like to state that I didn't receive a fair trial the first time. I don't think I'll receive a fair trial a second time,"" he told the court at the time. ""I don't think it's worth risking the possibility of spending the rest of my life in prison for something I didn't do. I take this plea to ensure that doesn't happen, and that's the only reason. I didn't kill my wife.""
Abaroa, now 39, was released from prison on Christmas Day 2017. He now lives in Utah.
Abaroa and his defense attorney declined to comment for this report.
Pond said her advice for other women who might meet Abaroa is to stay away.
""Please listen to what's out there, what's available on the Internet,"" she said. ""Please don't be drawn in, and please get away ... as fast as you can.""","Janet Abaroa was found stabbed to death in her Durham, North Carolina, home in 2005.",2019-03-27T10:18:56Z,How contact lenses blew open 2005 murder case and led to husband serving prison time,ABC News,0
"BERLIN (Reuters) - The party of right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban does not belong in the European People’s Party (EPP), the main center-right grouping in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday. 
Juncker, previously the longtime center-right prime minister of Luxembourg, was asked at a public forum in Stuttgart, Germany, for his reaction to a Hungarian government advertising campaign that accuses Juncker and philanthropist George Soros of seeking to flood Hungary with immigrants. 
“Against lies there’s not much you can do,” Juncker replied, adding that Manfred Weber, the EPP’s lead candidate for the upcoming European elections, would certainly be asking himself “if I need this voice” in the EPP.

"VILNIUS (Reuters) - About 100 financial companies and start-ups from Britain and elsewhere are applying for a licence in burgeoning fintech hub Lithuania to ensure they have access to the European Union after Brexit, the country’s central bank told Reuters. 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but has not yet reached a deal on a post-Brexit relationship, meaning companies with UK-issued licences may no longer have the right to provide some financial services in the EU. 
The companies, a quarter of which hail from Britain, are looking to get electronic money institution licences, Marius Jurgilas, member of the board at the central bank, told Reuters in an interview. 
“It seems that the companies, many of which are quite large, are behaving like a student who only starts worrying on the eve of an exam,” he said. 
He said Lithuania can process an electronic money institution licence application in as little as three months, compared to about a year in some EU countries, giving it an advantage over other fintech centres such as Luxembourg, Ireland or Belgium. 
“It is an onslaught ... We do not have the resources to process all the applicants. We have to pick-and-choose, prioritising the least risky applicants,” said Jurgilas, who did not provide names of the companies due to confidentiality rules. 
Ireland’s central bank said in October that it had seen a surge in financial services firms seeking to set up or extend their operations in Ireland as a result of Brexit and is processing over 100 applications.

"VILNIUS (Reuters) - About 100 British financial companies and start-ups are applying for a license in burgeoning fintech hub Lithuania to ensure they have access to the European Union after Brexit, the country’s central bank told Reuters. 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but has not yet reached a deal on a post-Brexit relationship, meaning companies with UK-issued license may no longer have the right to provide some financial services in the EU. 
British companies are looking to get electronic money institution license, Marius Jurgilas, member of the board at the central bank, told Reuters in an interview. 
“It seems that the companies, many of which are quite large, are behaving like a student who only starts worrying on the eve of an exam,” he said. 
He said Lithuania can process an electronic money institution license application in as little as three months, compared to about a year in some EU countries, giving it an advantage over other fintech centers such as Luxembourg, Ireland or Belgium. 
“It is an onslaught ... We do not have the resources to process all the applicants. We have to pick-and-choose, prioritizing the least risky applicants,” said Jurgilas, who did not provide names of the companies due to confidentiality rules. 
Ireland’s central bank said in October that it had seen a surge in financial services firms seeking to set up or extend their operations in Ireland as a result of Brexit and is processing over 100 applications.

"WASHINGTON (AP) Its looking increasingly like the partial government shutdown will be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year the first big confrontation between President Donald Trump and Democrats as agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power.
Now nearly a week old, the impasse is idling hundreds of thousands of federal workers and beginning to pinch citizens who count on varied public services. Gates are closed at some national parks, the government wont issue new federal flood insurance policies and in New York, the chief judge of Manhattan federal courts suspended work on civil cases involving U.S. government lawyers, including several civil lawsuits in which Trump himself is a defendant.
Congress is closing out the week without a resolution in sight over the issue holding up an agreement Trumps demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico and Democrats refusal to give him what he wants.
That sets up a struggle upfront when Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3. Trump has signaled he welcomes the fight as he heads toward his own bid for re-election in 2020.
This isnt about the Wall, Trump tweeted Thursday. This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump &amp; the Republicans have a win. He added Democrats may be able to block him now, but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!
With another long holiday weekend coming, just days before House Republicans relinquish control, there is little expectation of a quick fix. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has vowed to pass legislation as soon as she takes the gavel, which is expected when the new Congress convenes, to reopen the 15 shuttered departments and dozens of agencies now hit by the partial shutdown.
If they cant do it before January 3, then we will do it, said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., incoming chairman of the Rules Committee. Were going to do the responsible thing. Were going to behave like adults and do our job.
But even that may be difficult without a compromise because the Senate will remain in Republican hands and Trumps signature will be needed to turn any bill into law. Negotiations continue between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, but theres only so much Congress can do without the president.
Trump is not budging, having panned Democratic offers to keep money at current levels $1.3 billion for border fencing, but not the wall. Senate Republicans approved that compromise in an earlier bill with Democrats but now say they wont be voting on any more unless something is agreed to by all sides, including Trump.
I think its obvious that until the president decides he can sign something or something is presented to him that we are where we are, said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who opened the Senate on Thursday for a session that only lasted minutes.
Call it anything, he added, barrier, fence, I wont say the w word.
Trump long promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico refuses to do so.
Federal workers and contractors forced to stay home or work without pay are experiencing mounting stress from the impasse.
As the partial shutdown stretched toward a second week, Ethan James, 21, a minimum-wage contractor sidelined from his job as an office worker at the Interior Department, wondered if hed be able to make his rent. Contractors, unlike most federal employees, may never get back pay for being idled. Im getting nervous, he said. I live check to check right now.
For those without a financial cushion, even a few days of lost wages during the shutdown could have dire consequences.
Roughly federal 420,000 workers were deemed essential and are working unpaid, unable to take any sick days or vacation. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay.
Like James, Mary Morrow, a components engineer on contract for NASA, is in a predicament. In addition to caring for a family largely on her own, shes got a mortgage.
I have three teenage boys, its near Christmas time and we just spent money, there are credit card bills and normal bills and its really nerve-wracking, she said. Its scary.
Steve Reaves, president of Federal Emergency Management Agency union, said the shutdown could have consequences that stretch beyond a temporary suspension of salary. Many federal government jobs require a security clearance, he said, and missed mortgage payments or deepening debt could hurt their clearance.
David Dollard, a Federal Bureau of Prisons employee and chief steward for the American Federation of Government Employees Local 709 union in Colorado, said at least two agency employees lost their homes after the 2013 shutdown suspended their salaries. Bureau of Prisons employees are considered essential, and must work without pay. The agency is already understaffed, Dollard said. Shutdown conditions make everything worse.
You start out at $44,000 a year, theres not much room for anything else as far saving money for the next government shutdown, so it puts staff in a very hard situation, he said. Weve got single fathers who have child support, alimony. Its very hard to figure out what youre going to do.
Candice Nesbitt, 51, has worked for 1½ years for the U.S. Coast Guard, the only branch of the military affected by the shutdown. About 44,000 Coast Guard employees are working this week without pay; 6,000, including Nesbitt, have been furloughed.
Nesbitt worked for a contractor but took a pay cut in exchange for the stability of a government job. She has a mortgage, is the guardian of her special needs, 5-year-old grandson, and makes about $45,000 a year, she said. Any lapse in payment could plunge her into debt. It shakes me to the core, she said.",WASHINGTON (AP) — It's looking increasingly like the partial government shutdown will be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year — the first big confrontation between President Donald Trump and Democrats — as agreement eludes Washington in…,2018-12-28T11:16:37Z,No solution to shutdown before Dems take House...,Associated Press,0

"Omaha, Neb. — Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person. 
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. 
And in Fremont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriff's Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after flood waters broke through a levee along the Platte River. 
The flooding followed days of snow and rain — record-setting, in some places — that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places. 
The National Weather Service said it will continue. 
""Moderate to major and historic river flooding is expected to continue across parts of the Mississippi and Missouri River Basins through the weekend as a result of heavy rainfall earlier this week falling on frozen ground and a deep snowpack leading to intense and quick melting,"" the National Weather Service said Saturday. 
""Flood warnings and advisories remain in effect, mainly across parts of the eastern Nebraska, Iowa, and southern Wisconsin,"" it added. 
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilke's death. 
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.

Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Service's Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
""What we're having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event that's going to happen in early April,"" he said of the flooding on the Mississippi. 
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park.

"A tense congressional hearing to explore the spread of white nationalism on social media quickly served to illustrate the problem Silicon Valley faces after anonymous users on YouTube began posting vitriolic attacks that targeted others on the basis of race and religion.
The hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee was streamed live on the video site owned by Google, which testified Tuesday. Alongside the stream, a live chat featured posts from users, some of whom published anti-Semitic screeds and argued that white nationalism is not a form of racism.
""These Jews want to destroy all white nations,"" wrote the user Celtic Pride.
Anti-hate is a code word for anti-white, wrote another named Fight White Genocide.
Appearing before the committee, Alexandria Walden, the counsel for free expression and human rights at Google, stressed the tech giant has invested in people and technology to remove content that incites violent or spreads hate. We know the very platforms that have enabled these societal benefits can be abused, she said.
By the time she spoke, though, YouTube had disabled comments on the livestream, citing the uptick in hateful content, the company confirmed. Other YouTube live streams still had live chats enabled.
This just illustrates part of the problem were dealing with, said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the committee, after seeing the Posts report.
His comment was greeted with skepticism by Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican. Could that be another hate hoax? he asked. Just keep an open mind.
The tension infused the hearing, which had been called to explore the spread of hate speech and the rise of white supremacist movements in the United States, which Nadler described as an urgent crisis in our country. He said that white nationalism had motivated many of the worlds deadly attacks, including the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, the attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue last year and the shooting at two mosques in New Zealand last month.
In many cases, Nadler said, social-media sites had served as as conduits to spread vitriolic hate messages to every home, adding that Congress in recent years also has failed to take seriously the threat. He and other Democrats also raised the possibility that Trump had worsened the problem, given the presidents rhetoric on Twitter and his administrations approach to handling hate crimes widely.
[Racism and anti-Semitism surged in corners of the Web after Trumps election]
Some Republican lawmakers on the committee emphasized they shared a concern about the spread of white supremacy. Their comments came months after one of their own members, Rep. Steve King, faced an overwhelming vote of condemnation in the House for his comments about white nationalism. The top GOP lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), mentioned the matter but not King by name, even as he said that nothing white nationalists claim resonates with any of us here today.
But the witnesses invited to testify by Republicans sharply criticized Democrats for holding the hearing. Candace Owens, a prominent conservative and Trump ally, opened the hearing by calling it a form of fear mongering that serves as part of Democrats 2020 presidential election strategy.
""They blame Facebook, they blame Google, they blame Twitter, really [Democrats] blame the birth of social media, which has disrupted their monopoly on minds,"" she said.
[Facebook says it will now block white-nationalist, white-separatist posts]
Tuesdays hearing comes just weeks after a shooter targeted two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in an attack that reverberated widely on social media. The massacre had been broadcast on Facebook, while users on an anonymous web forum, called 8chan, schemed ways to continue to upload it to major tech platforms in a way that evaded their detection.
Appearing Tuesday, Facebook and Google each emphasized their efforts to hire new workers to review troubling content and invest in artificial-intelligence tools that can spot and remove troubling posts and videos before they go viral. ""Hate can take many forms beyond overt terrorism, and none of it is permitted on our platform,"" said Neil Potts, a public policy director at Facebook.
But the Anti-Defamation League, which testified Tuesday, estimated that white supremacists had been responsible for three quarters of all domestic extremist murders in 2018. These platforms are like round-the-clock digital white supremacist rallies, said Eileen Hershenov, the organizations senior vice president of policy.
To that end, civil-rights advocates urged lawmakers in response to consider and adopt new regulations of social-media giants, following in the footsteps of other countries that have sought to hold Facebook, Google and their peers accountable for harmful content posted online.
Instead of hiding under hoods, they now organize at computer screens, said Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers Committee for Equal Rights Under Law, about the rise of white supremacists.",A flood online of hate speech greets lawmakers probing Facebook and Google about white nationalism The Washington Post Racist and anti-Semitic comments flooded YouTube livestream of congressional hearing on white nationalism CNN Lawmakers held a hearing on wh…,2019-04-09T17:20:08Z,A flood online of hate speech greets lawmakers probing Facebook and Google about white nationalism - The Washington Post,The Washington Post,0

"Iowa Rep. Steve King said in a town hall this week that victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans only ever asked for help after flooding, unlike Iowans affected by recent severe flooding, who he said ""take care of each other."" The comment drew criticism from Louisiana officials who pointed out King's history of racially inflammatory remarks.
During the town hall in Charter Oak, Iowa, which was first reported by HuffPost, King described a visit to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, and said that a Federal Emergency Management Agency official compared disaster responses from New Orleans victims to Iowans.
""I saw that from the air and from the ground and went back and did what we could to help those folks down there,"" King said of his visit New Orleans. ""But here's what FEMA tells me: 'We go to a place like New Orleans and everybody's looking around saying, who's gonna help me, who's gonna help me?'""
He claimed that the FEMA official praised Iowans for taking care of their own problems and helping each other after a disaster.
""They're always gratified when they come and see Iowans take care of each other, so that's a point of pride that spreads across the country,"" King said in the video, which is posted on his Facebook page.
Welcome to Charter Oak, Iowa in Crawford County this Thursday morning for our 7th townhall. We’ll be going live at noon.
Posted by Congressman Steve King on Thursday, March 21, 2019
New Orleans is 60 percent black, while Iowa's population is over 90 percent white. Although he did not specifically refer to race, King's comments alluded to a stereotype that black people are lazy and rely on government handouts. The federal government has been widely criticized for its handling of disaster response the immediate aftermath of Katrina.
King has made numerous controversial and racist comments since taking office in 2003, and was recently stripped of his committee assignments after questioning in an interview with The New York Times when the term ""white supremacist"" became unacceptable.
King supported a House resolution condemning his remarks in January, and he called white supremacy an ""evil ideology."" However, his history of disparaging remarks towards immigrants and Muslims in particular has resulted in widespread condemnation from his own party, and he is facing primary challenges in 2020.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that King's comments about Katrina survivors were ""disgusting and disheartening."" Louisiana Rep.

Northern Californians living near parts of the Russian River were urged Tuesday night to evacuate as rain from an atmospheric river-fueled storm pushed the waterway to its flood stage of 34 feet, according to the National Weather Service.
Floodwaters were expected to rise throughout the night as the storm moved in, tapping tropical moisture from the Central Pacific and dumping rain throughout the region, including the Bay Area, the Sacramento area and wine country.

The area in the Sierra foothills devastated by last fall's Camp Fire in Butte County was not the biggest worry for forecasters, said National Weather Service meteorologist Johnnie Powell.
""Were not really concerned about the burn area up there, because most of the rain is centered toward Lake County,"" which is southwest, he said.
However, flooding was feared in areas ravaged by the Mendocino Complex Fire, which was recorded as the largest wildfire in state history in August. Forecasters expected the Russian River and the Navarro River to crest in that area Tuesday night.
The Eel River in Humboldt County was also expected to reach flood state, according to the NWS. The Napa and Carmel rivers were under flood warnings as well.
Multiple communities along the Russian River in Sonoma County were under mandatory evacuation orders as the river was expected to peak at 46 feet late Tuesday.
An urban and small stream flood warning was issued for a wide swath of Northern California, from Redding to the north to Stockton to the south.
Some parts of Northern California could see 14 inches of rain by the time the system moves out Wednesday night, Powell said.
Santa Rosa, California, already set a one-day rainfall record with 5.66 inches, the National Weather Service stated Tuesday afternoon.
""Were just getting an atmospheric river of rain coming in,"" Powell said. ""The Bay Area, Napa County, Lake County, Sacramento northward -- that's where the main water hose is.""
Snow was falling in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and other peaks above 4,000 feet, Powell said. An NWS forecast discussion called for ""heavy to excessive lower elevation rains likely over Central to Northern California ... while very heavy snows accumulate through the Sierra.""

One of them, the small city of Guerneville, ""is officially an island,"" the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. A short time later, an official said the nearby town of Monte Rio was also isolated by floodwaters with all roads leading to it swamped.
The swollen Russian River was forecast to rise more throughout the day, engorged by days of rain from western U.S. storms that has also dumped heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada, throughout the Pacific Northwest and into Montana.
The Russian River topped 32 feet (9.8 meters) Tuesday evening and it could crest at more than 46 feet (14 meters) by Wednesday night, which would be its highest level in about 25 years.
About 4,000 residents of Guerneville and two dozen other communities along the river were ordered to evacuate Tuesday evening.
There also was concern about potential mudslides in hillside areas saturated from days of downpours, and in areas scarred by 2017 wildfires.
A mudslide Tuesday near Monte Rio trapped a man and a woman before they were rescued, messy but unharmed.
""I fell into the mud when the tree fell over the top of me. It happened so fast you don't even know, you know?"" Kear Koch told KGO-TV.
Elsewhere in the area, several people had to be rescued from cars stranded while motorists tried to drive through flooded roads, including a woman who was rescued by boat.
Firefighters in Monte Rio worked through the night pulling people out of cars stuck in flooded roadways and getting people out of their homes as water approached, Fire Chief Steve Baxman told the Press Democrat newspaper.
""We took 17 people out of cars and houses during the night. Too many people are driving into water,"" he said.
Dee Rydberg on Tuesday removed computers and printers from her business, Guerneville Graphics and Printing.
""I could not afford to buy flood insurance,"" she said. ""So I'm packing up my stuff and getting out.""
Other waterways, including the Napa River, also were expected to overflow their banks as an ocean-spanning plume of moisture continued tracking through the West. Snow from the storms closed roads and schools and toppled trucks and trees from Oregon to Montana.
The National Weather Service also issued flood warnings and flash flood watches through Thursday morning for the San Francisco Bay Area and many parts of the Sacramento area.

Amid probes, White House lawyers prepare defense of Trump's executive privilege
WASHINGTON - A beefed-up White House legal team is gearing up to prevent President Donald Trump's confidential discussions with top advisers from being disclosed to House Democratic investigators and from being revealed in the special counsel's long-awaited report, setting the stage for a potential clash between the branches of government.
The strategy to strongly assert the president's executive privilege on both fronts is being developed under newly arrived White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who has hired 17 lawyers in recent weeks to help in the effort.
He is coordinating with White House lawyer Emmet Flood, who is leading the response to special counsel Robert Mueller's report on his 20-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Flood is based in White House counsel's office but reports directly to Trump.
Trump aides say White House lawyers are focused on preserving a legal protection routinely invoked by presidents of both major parties.
But any effort to fight investigators is likely to further inflame Trump's relationship with Democratic leaders and could lock the administration and Congress in protracted legal standoffs that may ultimately go to the Supreme Court.
Of particular concern to Democrats: whether the White House will seek to use executive privilege to keep private any portions of Mueller's report that addresses alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
There is a growing sense that the special counsel's closely held investigation could come to culmination soon. Some Trump advisers think Mueller could deliver the confidential report explaining his findings to senior Justice Department officials next month. Under the rules authorizing the special counsel, the attorney general can then decide whether to share the report or parts of it with Congress and the public.
Some House leaders have vowed to immediately seek to obtain a copy of Mueller's findings. But the White House would resist the release of details describing confidential and sensitive communications between the president and his senior aides, Trump advisers say.
It is unclear whether the special counsel's report will refer to material that the White House views as privileged communications obtained from interviews with senior White House officials. Some Trump advisers anticipate that Mueller may simply write a concise memo laying out his conclusions about the president's actions.
However, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's personal attorneys, said the president's lawyers have made clear to Justice Department officials that they want to see Mueller's completed report before the department decides what to share with Congress. Their aim: to have a chance to argue whether they believe some parts should remain private under executive privilege, Giuliani said.
""At that point, we can decide whether we have executive privilege exceptions to the report,"" Giuliani said in an interview.
If the Justice Department agrees with the White House counsel that the report or portions of it should be withheld from the public, the House could try to subpoena the document, Giuliani said - but the White House could then go to court to resist its release.
The legal showdown could be one of the most significant debates over presidential executive privilege since President Richard Nixon sought to block the release of his White House tapes in the Watergate investigation.
Ronald Weich, an assistant attorney general under President Barack Obama, said the Mueller report will be of such ""overwhelming interest"" to Congress and to the public that it is highly likely the courts would rule in favor of Congress' receiving it, as the Supreme Court did in ordering Nixon to turn over his tapes in July 1974. Nixon resigned the following month.
Further complicating the current dynamic is a possible change in Justice Department oversight of the special counsel probe, which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has continued to supervise day to day under acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker.
Trump's nominee for the top post, former Attorney General William Barr, has criticized aspects of Mueller's investigation. His Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week. Rosenstein is expected to leave the Justice Department if Barr is confirmed, although the timing of his departure is unclear.
In preparation for the looming legal battles, Cipollone has been beefing up the White House counsel's office, which was down to fewer than 20 lawyers late last year, compared with 40 to 50 in past administrations. Four of the five deputies under previous White House counsel Donald McGahn had left the office, The Washington Post reported last year.
Since his arrival in December, Cipollone has expanded the staff to about 35 lawyers, administration officials said, and he aims to bolster the ranks to 40 in the coming weeks. He also hired three deputies, all with extensive experience in the Justice Department and Republican administrations.
Cipollone, a longtime litigator who worked briefly in the 1990s for then-Attorney General Barr, declined to comment. But Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal attorneys, said the new White House counsel has quickly assembled a stable of top-notch lawyers.
""It's almost as if he's building a law firm within a government entity,"" Sekulow said. ""You have very senior lawyers coalescing into a great team.""
Under Cippollone's guidance, White House lawyers are preparing a strategy to fend off a blizzard of requests expected from congressional Democrats, who are planning to launch investigations into an array of topics such as Trump's finances and controversial administration policies.
Cipollone's goal, Trump aides said, is to try to find common ground with the congressional Democrats in responding to their subpoenas when he can, but to draw a clear line that would protect the confidentiality of the office of the presidency.
People who know Cipollone describe him as a self-effacing listener who will work to build relationships on Capitol Hill.
""Pat will be enormously effective, because if you meet him, you are not going to immediately put up your walls,"" said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who attended the University of Chicago Law School with Cipollone and now helps run American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group.
""Sure, you would expect him to take aggressive stands on executive privilege,"" she said. ""But if there is a court order, he won't bring on a constitutional crisis by resisting it.""
Cipollone first met Trump when Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham, a close friend, recommended him to help prepare the then-candidate for the 2016 presidential debates. He began informally advising Trump's team of personal lawyers in 2018.
In his new role, Cipollone is expected to consult and coordinate with Flood, a veteran of the Clinton impeachment battle, as Flood leads the response to the Mueller report.
Trump advisers are concerned that Mueller - whose team has interviewed numerous White House aides - could include in his report accounts of private communications between Trump and senior advisers such as McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.
""Conversations you had with your White House counsel. Conversations you had with senior advisers. Why should that be subject to disclosure?"" said one Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""It would be catastrophic for the presidency.""
White House lawyers are prepared to make a robust argument that such communications must be kept confidential under executive privilege. They credit former White House lawyer Ty Cobb, Flood's predecessor, along with Trump's previous personal attorney John Dowd, with crafting the legal strategy to shield those conversations.
Cobb agreed to turn over extensive internal White House documents and make staffers available for voluntary interviews with the special counsel, relying on a 2008 Justice Department legal opinion that said the department should not provide Congress with privileged information the White House turned over as part of an investigation.
It is unclear whether Mueller or other Justice Department officials would feel limited by that opinion. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.
Trump's lawyers have noted that the Obama White House also zealously defended executive privilege, including when it resisted sharing the president's correspondence with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of a House investigation.
At the time, one of Cipollone's new deputies expressed support for that stance.
""Executive privilege is not a partisan issue,"" wrote Mike Purpura, at the time a lawyer in private practice. ""It's important to protect the principle of allowing the president to receive candid, full, frank advice from his top advisers without fear that those deliberations and communications will become public.""
Purpura, who also served in the White House counsel's office under President George W. Bush, previously worked as a top Justice Department official and a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and Hawaii.
Another new White House counsel deputy, Patrick Philbin, who worked with Cipollone at the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, played a role in a famous legal showdown in the Bush administration over secret surveillance of Americans. As a senior staffer for then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey, Philbin joined Comey in rushing to then-Attorney General John Ashcroft's hospital bedside in 2004 as part of an effort to block a surveillance program they considered legally dubious.
A third new deputy White House counsel, Kate Comerford Todd, was a senior attorney at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's litigation center and previously worked as an associate White House counsel in the George W. Bush administration.
They join John Eisenberg, a national security expert who has served as a deputy in the counsel's office since Trump took office.

"But government services did not follow. The village school was built 40 years ago, the health center is 30 years old, and neither has been maintained, Mr. Yarari said. When floodwaters decimated the village in 2014, covering it in mud for months, it was the Red Cross that came to help, the leader said. Further upstream along the Beni River is San Miguel, which is fighting Mr. Morales over the proposed hydroelectric dams. If built, the dams would flood regions around Madidi National Park in Bolivias northwest, considered one of the worlds biodiversity hot spots. The Tacanas had spent years fighting previous governments over the project, but they were taken aback when Mr. Morales began pushing for it. In June, the indigenous group sent a small armada of canoes upstream to block the river, in an effort to keep engineers from the site. The dam project would aim to supply electricity to Brazil, but not to Amazonian villages in the area, like San Luis Grande. That angered Triniti Tayo Cori, a leader of the Tsimané people.","Evo Morales was Bolivia’s first indigenous president, but as he seeks a fourth term, many question whether he still represents their interests.",2018-12-08T15:34:08Z,"In Bolivia, Morales’s Indigenous Base Backtracks on Support",The New York Times,0
"Under the heading Climate Adaptation, the report cited the 147 acres of wetlands on the base and the Platte and Missouri rivers just outside the fence, and said:
During heavy rainfall, this area is prone to flooding, and flooding onto Offutt AFB may cause delays to missions and operations.
It went on: Due to changes in the base flood elevation of the Missouri River, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified the need to raise the levee between two inches to several feet for it to be capable of protecting the installation.
In particular, FEMA had ordered 19 miles of levees along the Missouri to be raised by 2 feet to protect Offutt and portions of Omaha, including one of the citys wastewater treatment facilities.
Officials responsible for flood preparedness at and around Offutt moved to address the risks, taking preliminary steps such as environmental assessments for raising the levee, but the process moved slowly.
We didnt have our head in the sand, Winkler, the manager of the local natural resources district, said.
There is no arguing with the science. We could see the dramatic changes in the weather we were experiencing, he said. We knew we had to react, and we are in the process of preparing for the new future.
But the levee improvements didnt come in time for this months flood.
A window into the future
Military experts say climate-related disasters such as the flooding of the Missouri River, wildfires that have interrupted military training across the country and punishing heat that is sickening thousands of military personnel a year must be taken into account as part of training and missions.
For the Department of Defense, the takeaway from this event has to be what lessons have been learned, said retired Army Lt. Col. Frank Galgano, an associate professor in the Department of Geography and the Environment at Villanova University.
A hangar at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska, is flooded by waters from the Missouri River on March 17, 2019.Nati Harnik / AP
You cant say it was an act of God and hope it doesnt happen again. You have to look at the frequency of these events and plan for the future.
The flood should be seen as a window into the future, when the potential loss of strategic bases such as Offutt and the Norfork Naval Station in Virginia to flooding would have consequences for the nations military preparedness, he said.
If this pattern persists, it may signal a larger problem, Galgano said.
As the floodwaters pushed onto Offutt over the weekend, Air Force personnel worked round-the-clock to shore up facilities, including the base headquarters building and its maintenance facility. They put in place 235,000 sandbags and 460 flood barriers, but ultimately had to surrender.
It was a lost cause, a base spokeswoman, Tech. Sgt. Rachelle Blake, told the Omaha World-Herald. We gave up.
Outside the gates of Offutt, flooding prompted evacuations in at least 23 of the states counties, according to Nebraska Emergency Management Agency officials.
Across 14 states bordering the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, more than 10 million people were under flood warnings at one point.
New military building standards for floodplains
This is the second time in six months that an Air Force base has sustained ruinous damage from a natural disaster. Hurricane Michael ripped apart Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida last October, causing so much damage that its long-term recovery is in question.
The disaster at Offutt amplifies national concerns that flooding poses significant threats to military installations. Last year, federal legislation requiring flood mitigation on military bases was signed into law.
The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Donald Trump, directed the Department of Defense to assess which facilities are located in flood-prone areas and require those facilities to create plans to mitigate the risk.
At a minimum, new buildings that are not mission-critical must be built 2 feet above the 100-year floodplain and new mission-critical facilities must be 3 feet above it.
Planning for a changing future, but not fast enough
Even before that directive, officials at Offutt were looking to the future.
A $1.3 billion STRATCOM headquarters that opened on the base earlier this year was built on higher land and wasn't directly affected by the flooding. The buildings design, including being surrounded by a barrier to reduce flood risk, also recognized the urgency to prepare for climate-related natural disasters.
In 2018, the Defense Department released a survey that highlighted the security risks climate change posed to more than 3,500 military installations. Non-storm surge flooding ranked third on the list of the most reported severe climate-related events.
In 2018, the Defense Department released a survey that highlighted the security risks climate change posed to more than 3,500 military installations.
A Pentagon report released to Congress earlier this year warned that climate change threatened key bases. The effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions, operational plans, and installations, the report said.
However, in a table in the report listing the risks faced by each of the dozens of bases, Offutt did not report intermittent flooding as a risk. Critics in Congress said the report was inadequate.
Meanwhile, in its formal national security outlook released in December 2017, the Trump administration did not mention the risks of climate change.
At Offutt, the focus now is on assessing the floods damage and ensuring the base is more prepared for the next big storm.
Winkler said there is no question the $22.7 million fortification of the levees would have saved Offutt from much of the damage that likely will cost far more.
Should we have built it faster? Yes, Winkler said. But thats easy to say now.

Portugal is sending an intervention taskforce to help in the search and rescue of survivors in Mozambique following the devastation caused by Cyclone Idai.
Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva says two Portuguese Airforce C130 transport planes were due to depart Thursday to the region. The first one was taking 35 soldiers, medical personnel and a disaster relief team from the National Republican Guard.
At least 200 people have died in Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony in southeast Africa, and 100 more in neighboring Zimbabwe, as a result of the cyclone over the weekend and widespread flooding that ensued.
Relief efforts were initially stifled by airport closures but international aid has begun arriving in the country.
Mozambique is home to thousands of nationals from Portugal. Santos Silva said that 30 of the country's citizens had not yet been contacted.

A week after Cyclone Idai hit coastal Mozambique and swept across the country to Zimbabwe, the storm's aftermath of flooding, destruction and death continues in southern Africa, making it one of the most destructive natural disasters in the region's recent history.
Floodwaters are rushing across the plains of central Mozambique, submerging homes, villages and entire towns. The flooding has created a muddy inland ocean 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide where there used to be farms and villages, giving credence to Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi's estimate that 1,000 may have been killed.
Mozambique reports that 200 have died and Zimbabwe reports a similar number but emergency workers say the death toll will continue to rise.

"President Trump on Friday threatened to close the Southern Border next week if Mexico does not “immediately stop” the record-breaking surge of illegal immigrants flooding into the United States.
Trump's warning comes as Customs and Border Protection officials say March is on pace to exceed 100,000 border apprehensions -- the highest monthly total in a decade. According to CBP, this week alone, agents have more than 12,000 migrants in custody.,
“The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, &amp; they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S.,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, &amp; Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S. through their country and our Southern Border.”
“Mexico for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through[sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.”
He continued: “This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and ‘talk.’ Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!”
The president’s tweet comes after similar threats earlier in the week to close the Southern Border, with Trump accusing Mexico and Central American nations of doing “nothing” as illegal immigration surges.
Trump’s initial warning came following comments made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAlleenan, who said this week that the border was at its “breaking point,” noting that there are not enough agents to respond to the flow of illegal immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
“That breaking point has arrived this week at our border,” McAleenan said during a visit to the border in El Paso, Texas. “CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our Southwest border.”
His agency also tweeted that they saw the highest number of ""apprehensions and encounters"" in over a decade this week -- over 4,000 in one day: ""#CBP saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade on Monday, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at ports of entry in a single day. Yesterday, that record was broken again—4,117 in a single day.""
Last month, more than 76,000 migrants were detained, marking the highest number of apprehensions in 12 years. That figure includes more than 7,000 unaccompanied children. More than 36,000 migrant families have arrived in the El Paso region in fiscal 2019 with about 2,000 at the same time last year, according to CBP data. The influx has prompted new challenges for Border Patrol agents.
And according to new data, the number of adults crossing the border illegally with children has surged. During the first four months of the year, CBP apprehended more than 136,000 migrants made up of adults and children who crossed illegally, marking a new record.
Meanwhile, the president, whose paramount 2016 campaign promise was to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, declared a national emergency in a bid to free up funding for the barrier along the border. This month, the president issued his first veto on a Democrat-backed measure to cancel the emergency.
On Tuesday, House Democrats failed to override Trump’s veto, allowing Trump to move forward with the issue.
Trump had declared the border emergency under a law that lets him shift budget funds to address dire situations. His plan is to shift an additional $3.6 billion from military construction projects to work on border barriers. Congress voted this year to limit spending on such barriers to less than $1.4 billion, and Democrats accused Trump of ignoring lawmakers' constitutional control over spending.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) The second in a string of powerful storms battered California on Saturday, shutting key highways after water and mud rushed into lanes from bare hillsides in wildfire burn areas where thousands of residents were under evacuation orders.
Flash flood warnings were issued for huge swaths of Southern California and forecasters said the system brought more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain at lower elevations and several feet of snow in the mountains, where whiteout conditions closed roads.
A wind gust in Santa Barbara County topped 80 mph (128 kph) as the storm moved south and at one point dropped more than a half-inch (1.27 centimeters) of rain in five minutes. Trees and power lines were down across the region.
In Malibu, where the Woolsey fire last year destroyed homes and burned hillsides bare, officials closed Pacific Coast Highway and many other roadways after mud carried trees and rocks into lanes. Residents whose homes survived the flames barricaded their properties with sandbags to protect their properties from floodwaters.
Carol Cavella was evacuated during the November fire and again Saturday when the creek behind her house threatened to overflow and inundate her backyard.
The 86-year-old put her cat in the car and drove to a coffee shop on higher ground, her son-in-law, Warren Bowman said.
She does not scare easily, but she got a little scared watching that water rise, Bowman said. He was trying to convince her to come to his house in Los Angeles but she said shed rather wait to see if the waters recede and she can return home.
The California Department of Transportation said Saturday night in a tweet that the both the northbound southbound lanes of U.S. 101, a vital route between Los Angeles and points north and west, have been reopened. Earlier Saturday, in the Montecito area of Santa Barbara County, several miles of U.S 101 were closed because of flooding.
Elsewhere in the county, evacuations were ordered or recommended for neighborhoods near the Thomas, Whittier and Sherpa fire scars.
This is a dangerous situation, the National Weather Service said, warning that the high rates of rain could send boulders sluicing down denuded hillsides along with the mud and debris.
It has only been a little over a year since a downpour on the huge Thomas Fire burn scar unleashed a massive debris flow that destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes in the seaside community of Montecito. The disaster killed 21 people, and two others have never been found.
Rescue crews scrambled Saturday to pluck motorists from cars caught in rising waters, said Mike Eliason, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. He urged drivers who come upon flooded intersections to find alternate routes.
Turn around. Driving through is going to be a costly error in judgment, he said. Its just not worth it.
Multiple accidents were reported on slick highways, including a crash on Interstate 5 that killed a volunteer member of a sheriffs search and rescue team, and injured several others.
The team from Ventura County was on its way to a training exercise when members stopped to help at the scene of a single-vehicle rollover crash.
A minivan carrying a family was traveling too fast for the wet conditions, lost control and plowed into members of the team, Los Angeles County fire Capt. Tony Imbrenda said. Nine people were transported to hospitals, including three members of the team. The victim, Jeff Dye, was a volunteer with the Fillmore Mountain Search and Rescue Team, the sheriffs department said.
This is a very unfortunate situation that couldve been avoided, Imbrenda said, warning motorists to slow down in the rain.
In the Holy Jim fire area southeast of Los Angeles, where an August blaze scoured tens of thousands of acres in the Cleveland National Forest, volunteers using heavy equipment removed debris and deepened a creek bed to help prevent flooding.
The National Park Service warned visitors to Yosemite National Park of possible road closures and advised drivers to bring tire chains in the event of snow or icy conditions.
Winter storm warnings were in place for the Sierra Nevada along with avalanche warnings on the Nevada side of the range. The Sierra is already loaded with snow from a series of storms in January. The weather service said areas could see accumulations of up to 10 feet (3 meters) over the next few days.
The weather service lifted flash-flood watches for areas burned by the Mendocino Complex, Camp and Carr wildfires in Northern California. About an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain was recorded in the San Francisco Bay Area before the storm moved south early Saturday.
A weaker storm soaked much of the state on Thursday Two cold weather systems will follow on Sunday and Monday, bringing additional widespread showers and snow, forecasters said.

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE Nov. 26, 2018 / 11:16 PM GMT The winter storm that crippled travel in the Midwest headed east on Monday, dropping heavy rain across flood-prone regions already soaked from earlier rain. And that's just the beginning. The National Weather Service said the rain would turn to snow, often heavy, across parts of New England as early as Monday night as the storm crashes into a low-pressure system along the Northeast coast. Snow accumulations could top a foot from upstate New York to northern Maine, where winter storm warnings and other winter advisories were in effect. Farther south, including New York City and Philadelphia, flood watches and warnings were in effect, with as much as 1½ more inches of rain expected through early Tuesday, forecasters said. ""We are expecting moderate to heavy rainfall that can cause slippery conditions during this evening's rush,"" said Joseph Esposito, New York City's emergency management commissioner. ""Take it slowly during the evening commute home and allow for extra travel time."" On its back side, the storm will also produce lake effect snow of 10 inches or more around lakes Erie and Ontario through the middle of the week, the weather service said. Gusty winds in both regions will whip the snow to create dangerous travel conditions, it said. ""We urge drivers to delay unnecessary travel in winter weather, and if you must travel, please slow down and give plow operators plenty of room,"" Pennsylvania Transportation Secretary Leslie Richards said. Northern New England was expected to be especially hard hit, with as much as 1½ feet of snow expected. School officials were nervously watching conditions on Monday in Rumford, Maine, where a foot of snow was expected and where a pile-up of snow days could cause problems when those days have to be made up later in the school year. Deb Alden, superintendent of Regional School Unit 10, told NBC affiliate WCSH of Portland that accumulating snow days before Christmas ""is not normal. Rumford said she was likely to cancel classes on Tuesday only the second snow day of the year so far. But she acknowledged, ""It's not a perfect science."" The storm blanketed much of the Midwest over the weekend, snarling flights, closing highways and shutting schools in several states. More than 1,200 arrivals and departures were canceled at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago alone on Monday, making up vast majority of the 1,500 cancellations that were reported across the country by late Monday afternoon. At least 24 schools lost power Monday in Chicago, their parents learning via text message and Facebook that their kids were shivering in the cold, NBC Chicago reported. ""They were cold and saying it was cold,"" said Ruben Beltran, whose children attend Nathan Hale Elementary School. ""Fortunately for me, I didn't have to work today."" Chicago Public Schools said nearly all the affected schools had partial power and maintained safe temperatures, so they are able to remain open safely.

"COLUMBUS, Miss. Weekend storms raked parts of the Southeast, leaving deaths and injuries in their wake as a tornado smashed into a commercial district in a small Mississippi city and drenching rains fed a rising flood threat.
A woman was killed when a tornado hit Columbus, Mississippi, and a man died when he drove into floodwaters in Tennessee, officials said.
Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. said 41-year-old Ashley Glynell Pounds of Tupelo and her husband were renovating a house Saturday evening, and when the husband went to get them something to eat, the building collapsed and killed her.
Smith said 12 other people were injured, but the injuries did not appear to be major. City spokesman Joe Dillon said the tornado also seriously damaged a school and two community center buildings.
In Knox County, Tennessee, officials said a man died after his vehicle became submerged in high water.
The tornado Saturday afternoon in Columbus was confirmed on radar, said meteorologist Anna Wolverton with the National Weather Service in Jackson. She told The Associated Press that experts would be headed Sunday to the east Mississippi city of about 23,000 people to gauge the tornado's intensity.
At First Pentecostal Church in Columbus, the Rev. Steve Blaylock said the building was ""a total loss,"" with a wall pushed in, holes in the roof and substantial water damage. He and his congregants tried to salvage what they could on the morning after the storm. But he said they still held a Sunday prayer service and even went ahead with a scheduled baptism, using a borrowed portable baptismal pool.
""We will rebuild. We've got a good church here,"" Blaylock said. ""It'll be a testimony of God.""
Residents of one street on the east side of Columbus were out early Sunday morning with chain saws, clearing away branches of the many trees that had snapped or were uprooted in the storm. Metal siding and roofing materials were scattered throughout the neighborhood of older homes. While the houses generally remained standing, sheds and outbuildings were mostly demolished.
Lee Lawrence, who said he has been selling used cars for decades in Columbus, told The AP that four buildings on his car lot were destroyed. He said trees toppled across vehicles and car windows were blown out.
Lawrence said he was at home getting ready to take a bath when the storm struck.
""The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close,"" he said, speaking with AP in a phone interview.
""It will be a start-over deal,"" Lawrence said. ""I can't say it will come back better or stronger, but we'll come back.""
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrence's lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Firefighters and law enforcement officers cordoned off the area, and power was out in the area.
Elsewhere around the South, homes, highways, parks and bridges were flooded or put out of commission amid the heavy rains and severe storms. News outlets report that water rescues have been performed in some Middle Tennessee counties. Flash flood warnings and watches remained in place throughout the South and one Mississippi community reported large hail.
Interstate 40 near the Tennessee line with North Carolina was closed by a rockslide, one of the dozens of roads and highways shut down throughout the region, transportation officials said.
Officials said a mudslide destroyed a Subway restaurant in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. No injuries were reported.
In West Virginia, officials have evacuated 11 families in the southern part of the state from low-lying areas due to flooding from heavy rains. High wind warnings remained in effect Sunday for much of the state. WCHS-TV reports more than 21,000 Appalachian Power customers were without power Sunday afternoon.
In Bruce, Mississippi, rivers broke flood stage and flash floods poured into homes and businesses. News outlets report that officials in Grenada, Mississippi, declared a local state of emergency after dozens of streets and homes flooded. A 6-mile (9-kilometer) stretch of the Natchez Trace Parkway was closed in Mississippi after water covered part of the road.
The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for northwestern Lafayette County in Mississippi after emergency officials reported that a local dam was at risk of failing. Meteorologist Kole Fehling says emergency officials reported the threat involved the Audubon Dam, which blocks a creek on the north side of Oxford and a subdivision.
Weather officials said the storm's impact stretched from eastern Arkansas to northern Georgia and beyond. Alabama's governor declared a state of emergency in several counties, hoping to speed recovery in event of damages.
Kentucky announced Friday that it was closing the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois, because of flooding on the southern approach. The bridge, which carries 4,700 vehicles a day, is likely to stay closed until Thursday, and possibly longer.
Near Jamestown, Kentucky, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing releases from the Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River. Areas downstream of the dam, from Rowena to Burkesville, could be affected by flooding as a result, officials said.
The Ohio River at Cairo was predicted to crest Sunday at its third-highest level ever recorded, and stay that high into next week. The Tennessee River near Savannah, Tennessee, also was forecast to crest at near-record levels.

"Chimanimani, Zimbabwe (CNN)As many as ""300 to 400"" bodies line the banks of a road out of the city of Beira, in Mozambique, according to an eyewitness account, suggesting that the human toll of Cyclone Idai is likely to far exceed official estimates. 
The harrowing scene, described by Zimbabwean Graham Taylor, follows reports from aid agencies on the ground detailing how entire villages and towns have been completely flooded in the wake of last Thursday's high-end Category 2 storm.
Taylor said the bodies were located on a 6 kilometer (3.7 mile) track of highway, where flood waters had created an inland ocean, submerging entire villages around a ""densely populated"" sugar-cane plantation. The area is a mere fraction of the land in the southeast African nation left flooded after two major rivers burst their banks in the days following the storm. 
More than one week on from the storm's initial impact, the United Nations has confirmed 242 dead in Mozambique, with 259 lives lost in Zimbabwe and 56 in Malawi. 
But information has been slow to emerge. On Monday, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said that ""everything indicates that we can have a record of more than 1,000 dead"" -- a figure that some experts now believe could be conservative. 
Taylor, 62, who has lived in Mozambique for 10 years, became stranded on Saturday on the highway to Zimbabwe from Beira, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, after flood waters one-meter high blocked the road.
At 3 a.m. on Monday, he abandoned his car and joined the streams of people wading in the pitch black through the waters along the raised highway.
In the dark, he could hear people ""sobbing and crying.""
As dawn broke, those sobs began to make sense as a ""terrible sight"" emerged, Taylor said. 
""Dead bodies had floated up (and the) current of the flood water had washed the bodies up against the road,"" said Taylor. ""The road had subsided about 10 inches (25.5 centimeters). So these bodies had been washed up against the main highway.""
Taylor said the smell of bodies and livestock was palpable. 
Hundreds of others were also attempting to make the congested seven-hour walk from the village of Lamego -- about 90 kilometers (56 miles) inland from Beira -- to Nhamatanda, on higher ground.In places where thecurrent of the flood waters was strong, about 50 people joined hands to make a human chain, said Taylor.
""I'm 6 foot 2 inches (187 centimeters), but the force of water at knee level was powerful,"" Taylor said. ""You had to pay attention and concentrate where you put your feet.""
Taylor said he saw an elderly woman carry her husband on her back.
On the road out of Beira, he said ""the entire area, as far as I could see, was one lake of floodwater,"" adding that groups of up to 10 people had climbed eucalyptus, cashew and mango trees waiting to be rescued. 
But he also saw people heading back towards the flood zone.
""They said they couldn't account for their families and wouldn't leave until they could do,"" he said. 
Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on midnight local time on Thursday, March 14, with 175 kph (109 mph) winds, 
It wasn't the strongest storm to have hit Mozambique, but the region had recently been deluged by heavy rains. After lingering off the coast for days, gathering strength, Idai finally dumped a huge amount of water on Beira -- a city of 500,000 people -- destroying ""90%"" of the area, according to aid agencies. 
One week later, thousands of people remain missing across Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. Millions of others across have been left destitute without food or basic services, according to reports.  
The high commissioner for Mozambique in the UK, Filipe Chidumo, said Wednesday that the country needs ""a sustained effort on part of the Mozambican government as well as the international community"" to help rescue stranded people, and provide, food, sanitation and water for those at risk.
""This is a big tragedy of biblical proportions,"" he said, adding that major work will be needed, including the restoration of electricity, water and sanitation to prevent the emergence of waterborne diseases, as well as repairs to public infrastructure.
'The soils had filled my mouth'
After hitting Mozambique, Cyclone Idai tore into Zimbabwe killing many people as they slept. 
The 83-year-old husband of one Chimanimani resident was buried alive when their bedroom collapsed on them last Friday.  
""We were sleeping in the house around 10 p.m. in the evening and it was raining. It kept on pouring when rocks sliding from the hill started hitting our house,"" said the 59-year-old.
""The stones we built our house with collapsed on us, and then I yelled, 'oh my, I'm dying!' The soils had filled my mouth, nose and ears. Water filled the house to almost my neck level ... I started to shake my husband's body to no avail. He was already dead.""
Nearby, another family had abandoned searching for their 16-year-old missing son, who they suspect is buried under the mud. 
Efforts to bring aid to those affected by Cyclone Idai are under way in Zimbabwe. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government is airlifting food to some of the areas where people are still trapped. 
Mnangagwa has declared March 23 and 24 national days of mourning.
""I want some shelter, I have none,"" said one Chimanimani resident. ""I have no blankets. No pots. My plates, sofas were all destroyed ... I do not know if I will survive or not.""

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 68 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 forced to take refuge in emergency shelters after floods, landslides and a tornado battered the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the past week, authorities said on Sunday. 
Rescue teams were still looking for seven missing people, while 47 had been injured during the devastation that saw heavy rains cause a dam to overflow, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency. 
More than 5,000 homes had been submerged with scores of bridges, schools and places of worship damaged, as well as thousands of acres of rice paddies destroyed, he said in a statement. 
Some displaced people had started to return to their homes as flood waters receded, but heavy equipment was needed to clear a thick layer of mud that had enveloped roads and houses, he said. 
Others had chosen to remain in camps after being traumatized, Nugroho said, adding that there was still an urgent need for food, blankets and medical services. 
The devastation that has struck Southern Sulawesi in the past week had also extended to Makassar, the capital of the province.

"YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations is making plans to help Bangladesh relocate thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote island off its coast, documents seen by Reuters show, a move opposed by many refugees and that some human rights experts fear could spark a new crisis. 
Bangladesh says transporting refugees to Bhasan Char a Bay of Bengal island hours by boat from the mainland will ease chronic overcrowding in its camps at Cox’s Bazar, which are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighboring Myanmar. 
Humanitarian and human rights groups have criticized the relocation proposal, saying the island is flood-prone, vulnerable to frequent cyclones and could be completely submerged during a high tide. 
A document drawn up by the World Food Programme (WFP), the U.N.’s food aid arm, shows the agency has supplied the Bangladesh government with detailed plans including a timeline and budget of how it could provide for thousands of Rohingya transported to the island within weeks. It stresses that any relocation should be voluntary and done “in accordance with humanitarian principles and code of conduct”. 
The document, labeled as a “Concept of Operations” and dated March 12, outlines how the organization and its partners “may facilitate the identification, staging, forward movement, reception, and sustainment of refugees” on Bhasan Char, estimating an initial appeal for donor funding of between $8.6 and $19 million. 
More detailed operational planning would be needed it says, noting the Concept of Operations had been “developed quickly and without the benefit of any recent on-site assessment”. 
Gemma Snowdon, communications officer for WFP in Cox’s Bazar, said the organization was part of “ongoing discussions” with the government over the future of the refugee response. 
“The viability of safely relocating people to Bhasan Char needs to be thoroughly assessed and WFP is investigating the potential operational needs, financial costs, and challenges in several areas that we traditionally support in emergencies: food security, emergency telecommunications and logistics,” she said. 
REFUGEE INFLUX 
The numbers of refugees in the Cox’s Bazar camps have grown dramatically since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that U.N. investigators have said was conducted with “genocidal intent” prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee. Myanmar has denied almost all allegations of atrocities made by refugees during what is says was a legitimate counterterrorism operation by its security forces. 
Bangladesh says it is struggling to cope with the influx and wants to start relocating thousands of refugees to the island, which it says has been secured with flood defense embankments and cyclone shelters. 
A senior U.N. official told reporters in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Thursday the organization welcomed the fact the government had “taken steps to identify alternative settlements”. 
“As you also know if you have been to Kutapalong and the various camps in Cox’s Bazar area, it is clear that there is huge congestion,” said Volker Turk, Assistant High Commissioner for the U.N. refugee agency. 
Mozammel Haque, the head of Bangladesh’s cabinet committee on law and order and a senior government minister, told Reuters in an interview the government planned to start moving refugees next month. 
“We are in talks with U.N. agencies and they have agreed,” he said. “Now we are working on other things like how to move them and other strategies. We are the host country. We will decide where to keep them. And we are doing everything to ensure their safety and security.” 
Abul Kalam, the Relief and Repatriation Commission chief based in Cox’s Bazar, told Reuters preparations were “still going on” and the site was not ready. 
FLOOD-PRONE ISLAND 
Bhasan Char, a flat and featureless island that emerged from the sea 20 years ago, has never been inhabited. 
Humanitarians have not visited since a four-hour trip in September 2018, according to WFP. An internal report produced after that visit, also seen by Reuters, found a 1,500-acre area of the 13,000-acre island had been encircled by a nine-foot (3 meter) embankment, short of the 21-foot barrier recommended by WFP. 
Housing with corrugated iron roofs and concrete floors and walls for about 70,000 people had been built, but there were only enough cyclone shelters for 17,000. 
A U.N. human rights investigator who visited in January said earlier this month she feared a “new crisis” if Rohingya were taken to the island. 
“There are a number of things that remain unknown to me even following my visit, chief among them being whether the island is truly habitable,” said Yanghee Lee, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar. 
In Cox’s Bazar, local officials are compiling lists of the first refugees to be moved, District Administrator Mohammad Kamal Hossain told Reuters. 
On Thursday, a poem by a Rohingya refugee titled ‘Do Not Send Me to the Island’ was posted to social media. “I’m a human being, I deserve all human rights,” it read. 
“You know, we are refugees, surviving in refugee camp for two years,” the author, 22-year-old Mohammed Rezuwan, told Reuters in a message. “Still we are tolerating so much tragedies.”

"With that, Ms. Nichol laughed with relief and then cried out of happiness as she said yes several times. Mr. Egerton later confessed that he didnt have enough money for a real ring, but assured her that he was saving.
The couples experience has apparently been widely shared in the last week, as more than 20,000 people have purchased the engagement ring from the discount store Poundland (the British equivalent of Americas Dollar Store). They come in four varieties, with stones resembling diamonds, topaz and rubies, and cost one pound, or about $1.30.
The rings have prompted a flood of proposal posts on social media and television the British presenter Piers Morgan jokingly proposed to his co-host, Susanna Reid, on air and nearly as much commentary. While some women have dismissed the rings as tacky or insulting, others have welcomed them as a funny and spontaneous idea that allows women to participate in choosing the real ring.
We dont need to spend thousands in order to tell someone we love them and want to commit, said Kate Baxter, a jeweler designer and consultant, and the founder of The Cut London, a jewelry store. A friend of mine was proposed to with a shell on the beach, then you can choose the perfect ring together.
The notion that a man should spend three times his monthly salary is outdated, in my opinion, she added.

"Bertha is larger than life in many ways. Shes big and bosomy, which is worth remarking because so many of the people in this novel, men and women, have had too much cake and too little exercise. McCracken writes wonderfully and perceptively about large bodies. If she were a painter or sculptor, shed be Fernando Botero or Henry Moore, not Modigliani or El Greco.
Bertha, who is described as a prophet of bowling, opens a candlepin alley. The place is a success, in part because of its feminist bona fides. In most bowling alleys at the time, McCracken writes, women had to bowl behind curtains, separated from the men for modestys sake. Not here.
Women bowling in the open bring gawkers, because where else could you see such a good-looking girl dewy with sweat and happiness, and not pay a cent, and not have to go to confession?
This candlepin alley attracts ghosts. A major character spontaneously combusts. Another dies in the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, which is a correlative, at times, for the experience of reading Bowlaway.
The alley attracts orphans and sensitive, damaged souls, the heartbroken and the disinherited. As this novel moves through the decades we follow them, as well as the children of Bertha and others. Some go to New York City. Others go to wars. Some open their own bowling alleys.
The plot has many resonances but never fully sets its hooks in us. The politics of nearly all its characters, with respect to feminism, interracial marriage, and gay and lesbian tendencies, are anachronistically progressive.
This novels cast grows epic, but McCracken is always most impressive when she works small, when she is describing movie kisses or corsets or simply loneliness and longing.

"A Nebraska city walled off by massive flooding is getting a big lift from private pilots who are offering free flights to shuttle stranded residents to and from their hometown.
Flooding from the Platte River and other waterways is so bad that just one highway lane into Fremont remains uncovered, authorities said Monday. Emergency responders have restricted access for safety reasons, leaving residents in the city of 26,000 stuck on an island in the middle of Nebraska farm country, about 40 miles northwest of Omaha. The flooding in Fremont comes as communities in several Midwestern states grapple with swollen rivers and breached or overtopped levees following heavy rain and snowmelt.
After a weekend with no road access to the outside world, officials in Fremont said they still dont know when any will reopen. The flights were a godsend for Sue Ankersen, 56, who lives in the city but wasnt able to return home after baby-sitting her granddaughter in Omaha on Friday. Ankersen said she had never flown in a small plane before, but heard about the flights from her daughter and worked up the courage to go because she was homesick and wanted to volunteer to help others.
I call them angels of the sky, she said. Im just so thankful for these guys doing this.
The makeshift shuttle flights have led to a surge in air traffic at the Fremont Municipal Airport and its two runways. Pilots have flown in from at least five nearby airports in Nebraska as well as others in western Iowa and Kansas, said Jim Kjeldgaard, the airports operator.
Kjeldgaard estimated that at least 30 airplanes have flown more than 500 people since Friday, and the airport was still bustling on Monday morning.
Were going full steam today, Kjeldgaard said. Its been a massive undertaking.
He said pilots have taken passengers out of town to get to medical appointments, funerals and relatives who live elsewhere. Theyve also hauled water, food, toilet paper and other supplies. One pilot joked to Kjeldgaard that the airport was busier than Omahas Eppley Airfield, the states largest airport.
Most of the pilots heard of the effort by word of mouth and saw it as a chance to use their skills for a good purpose, said George Richmond, a flight instructor and former airline pilot. Richmond said he flew girls and their grandmother from Fremont to Lincoln on Sunday to unite them with family members.
Its a grassroots operation, he said between flights in his Piper Comanche. Pilots are doing it because its something we can do.
Herb Johansen, a pilot from Bennington, removed the back two seats from his Piper Saratoga so he could haul water, diapers, clothing and food into town along with passengers mostly college students from Midland University. He said the airplane traffic around Fremont is hectic, maybe even semi-dangerous because so many pilots are landing and taking off from the small airport.
Fremont City Administrator Brian Newton said its too early to say when the roads will reopen. Floodwaters from the Platte and Elkhorn rivers have forced the closure of U.S. Highways 77 and 275 on both the north and south sides of Fremont, and U.S. Highway 30 on the east and west sides of the city. Some Fremont police officers who live on the outskirts had to catch flights from the volunteer pilots so they could report to work, Newton said.
Just one lane of U.S. Highway 30 west of town wasnt totally covered with water, and law enforcement limited traffic on the road to ensure a route for gas, food, water and other essentials.
Newton said officials are concerned that flooding may have undermined the integrity of the main bridge on U.S. Highway 77 that crosses the Platte River just south of Fremont.
U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, who lives in Fremont, said he was working with the Trump administration in hopes of getting federal aid to Nebraska as quickly as possible. Sasse said he was concerned about the floods long-term impact and the problems that road damage could cause for farmers trying to get their products to market.
Sasse said his parents ended up stranded in Omaha during the flood and were offered a flight into town from a volunteer pilot. He said pilots have also shuttled in supplies, while on-the-ground volunteers filled sandbags to try to prevent the flood from spreading.
Im not surprised at all, the senator said. This is just the way Nebraskans are.

"As President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border in recent days, his Department of Homeland Security nearly doubled the number of temporary guest worker visas available this summer.
DHS and the Labor Department plan to grant an additional 30,000 H-2B visas this summer on top of the 33,000 H-2B visas they had planned to give out, the agencies confirmed.
The H-2B visa is for foreign workers to come to the United States and work for several months at a company such as a landscaper, amusement park or hotel. About 80 percent of these visas went to people from Mexico and Central America last year, government data show.
Trump says there is a national emergency at the southern border because too many people are trying to come to the United States. On Friday, he implored migrants to turn around and go home.
""We can't take you anymore,"" Trump said Friday while standing at the border in California. ""Our country is full.""
But his administration is giving a different message to some short-term workers. With the additional visas, the Trump administration is on track to grant 96,000 H-2B visas this fiscal year, the most since 2007, when George W. Bush was president.
""It's ironic that Trump is demagoguing and railing against a so-called dangerous and scary flood of migrants and caravans from Mexico and Central America, and even threatening to shut down the border, while at the same time using his legal authority to grow a guest worker program by nearly 50 percent,"" said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
A major theme of Trump's presidential campaign was that foreign workers were stealing U.S. jobs, but lately he has said it might be necessary to bring in more guest workers because the economy is doing so well that companies can't find enough people to fill jobs. The unemployment rate, at 3.8 percent, is near a 50-year low.
There is bipartisan support in Congress pushing the administration to make this move. A group of senators, including Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sent a letter to the Trump administration urging them to let in more H-2B workers. DHS made the decision to increase the visas offered at the end of March and is expected to publish details in the Federal Register soon.
The H-2B program is supposed to grant 66,000 visas a year with about half for the winter months and half for the summer, but Congress gave the Trump administration the authority issue another 69,000 this fiscal year. DHS ultimately decided to issue the extra 30,000 to people who have held H-2B visas before.
There is such a flood of applications for these visas that they are all typically gone within minutes of the application process opening up. Trump's own hotels have used H-2B workers. Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida applied for 78 of these visas last year.
Advocates for U.S. workers claim Trump is undermining domestic workers by granting so many H-2B visas.
The Center for Immigration Studies, which urges lower immigration, said Trump ""betrays American workers"" with this H-2B visa increase.
EPI, a left-leaning think tank, put out research this week showing that H-2B visa workers are typically paid less than American workers who do the same jobs. For example, landscaping workers on the visa are paid an average of $12.94 an hour, more than a dollar less than the $14.28 average wage paid to U.S. workers, according to an analysis of data from the Labor Department and H-2B visa applications.
""Trump seems to be perfectly fine with letting people migrate to the United States if they're going to be exploited workers, and especially if they're going to work for one of his companies,"" Costa said.
A DHS spokeswoman said Congress ""is in the best position"" to know the appropriate number of H-2B visas that are needed for the economy. She said DHS is urging Congress to fix the immigration system and set appropriate visa levels.
Trump has been hinting in recent weeks that he might allow more guest workers since the economy is doing so well.
""I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place,"" Trump said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.","As President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border in recent days, his Department of Homeland Security nearly doubled the number of temporary guest worker visas available this summer.

"There's no shortage of speculation on the special counsel Robert Muellers report, much of it totally uninformed.
But we don't need to speculate on the scope the man who appointed Mueller has already given us a potential road map on what to expect from the special counsel.
The bottom line: Do not expect a harsh condemnation of President Donald Trump or any of his associates if they have not been charged with crimes.
The road map comes in the form a little-noticed 12-page letter written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last June to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley.
The letter was in response to Grassley's demands for more information on the special counsel investigation, offers a brief history of special counsel investigations and actually quotes former and future Attorney General William Barr who appointed three special counsels during his time as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush.
In the letter, Rosenstein makes it clear he believes the Department of Justice will not and cannot without violating long-standing Department of Justice policy include disparaging or incriminating information about anybody who has not been charged with a crime.
""Punishing wrongdoers through judicial proceedings is only one part of the Department's mission,"" Rosenstein wrote. ""We also have a duty to prevent the disclosure of information that would unfairly tarnish people who are not charged with crimes.""
Sources familiar with the investigation believe there are no more indictments coming from the special counsel. If Mueller follows the guidance of the man who appointed him and supervised his investigation, he cannot publicly disparage those who have not been charged with a crime.
Rosenstein is emphatic on this point: ""In fact, disclosing uncharged allegations against American citizens without a law-enforcement need is considered to be a violation of a prosecutor's trust.""
Later in the letter, he makes it clear this standard applies to anybody under investigation, even public officials.
""No matter who an investigation involves -- an ordinary citizen, a local or state politician, a campaign official, a foreign agent, an officer of the federal legislative, executive, or judicial branch -- agents and prosecutors are obligated to protect its confidentiality.""
In the letter Rosenstein directly takes issue with the justification then-FBI Director James Comey used to publicly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 even as he decided not to charge her with a crime. At the time, Comey justified the break with long-time DOJ practice as an ""extraordinary step"" necessary because of circumstances so unusual they were comparable to a ""500-year flood.""
""It is important for the Department of Justice to follow established procedures, especially when the stakes are high,"" Rosenstein wrote.","ABCNEWS: 'Sources familiar' believe NO MORE INDICTMENTS coming...

"Columbia, S.C. -- Two South Carolina law officers were charged Friday in the deaths of two women who drowned while locked in the back of a sheriff's department van during Hurricane Florence. Stephen Flood is charged with two counts each of reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter, according to online court records. Joshua Bishop faces two counts of involuntary manslaughter. 
A judge set bond at $30,000 for Flood and $10,000 for Bishop and both were released after posting bail. 
Flood, 66, and Bishop, 29, were fired from the Horry County Sheriff's Office in October as part of an internal investigation. Authorities said the deputies were driving 45-year-old Wendy Newton and 43-year-old Nicolette Green through Marion County to a mental-health facility under a court order when their van was swept away by rising floodwaters as Hurricane Florence inundated the state. 
According to records from the state Criminal Justice Academy, Flood made a ""conscious decision"" to drive around a barricade near the Little Pee Dee River, and Bishop didn't try to stop him. 
The powerful tropical system smashed into the Southeast coast as a hurricane Sept. 14, triggering severe flooding as it weakened yet nearly stalled over the Carolinas for days. 
Green and Newton drowned in the back of the locked van on Sept. 18. 
The families of both women tearfully addressed the judge Friday. Rose Hershberger, Green's oldest daughter and a high school senior, mourned her mother missing milestones like her graduation. 
""Every night is just a constant lack of sleep,"" Hershberger said. ""All I see is my mother, and I hear her screams and her cries."" 
Lawyers for both Bishop and Flood said their clients had no criminal history and both have ties to the community. Flood's lawyer, Allie Argoe, said her client had no intention to hurt the women in the van. 
""We hope the truth of what really happened that day will come out,"" Argoe said. 
During a November legislative hearing, advocates for the women said neither one was violent. Newton was only seeking medicine for her fear and anxiety the day she died, a family attorney said, while Green's family said she was committed at a regular mental health appointment by a counselor she had never seen before. 
Horry County officials have said that the deputies tried unsuccessfully to rescue the women from the van, which was on its side, blocking the door the deputies would have needed to unlock with a key. When rescue crews finally arrived, the van was underwater, and the deputies were plucked from its roof. 
Working numbers for Bishop and Flood could not be found. Their next court appearances were scheduled for late February. 
Many roads in the northeastern part of the state were flooded out and blocked off in the days following the powerful storm. Authorities with the sheriff's department have said that the deputies, in a marked sheriff's department vehicle, were waved through a barricade near the Little Pee Dee River by National Guardsmen charged with keeping motorists out of the area. 
The Little Pee Dee was one of several rivers officials watched closely in the days following the storm. 
In the months since, a legislative committee has opened hearings into the incident, discussing potential changes to the laws on how patients who are committed to mental hospitals are handled by police. Democratic state Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who has headed up those hearings, said bipartisan legislation will be filed in the coming week, in the hopes of preventing similar tragedies in the future. 
""Mental illness is not a law enforcement issue,"" Kimpson told The Associated Press. ""It's a health issue, and that's where our focus needs to be.""",Authorities said the deputies were driving the women to a mental-health facility under a court order when their van was swept away by rising floodwaters,2019-01-05T04:40:46Z,Ex-deputies charged in deaths of women who drowned in transport van,CBS News,0
"China has traditionally used its state-controlled banking system to flood the economy with money when growth slows. Last year, China cut the reserve ratio four times. But economists, small businesses and many others say the mechanism shovels money into big, inefficient companies or into investment bubbles instead of toward the smaller entrepreneurs who need it more.
The cut will be good for curbing the economic downturn and solving the financing difficulties of enterprises, said Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
But this is just one policy, Mr. Yu added, saying it risks pouring money into real estate and the stock market, which would do little to solve the economys problems. We need a lot of other policies to cooperate.
For several weeks, economists and analysts have speculated that officials could move to push a hefty stimulus package that would give the flagging economy a shot in the arm. But such bold moves have become increasingly difficult for the Chinese government, which is still contending with a huge debt load accumulated over the past decade to spur growth.
Still, many analysts took the move as a sign that Chinas leader would be proactive in heading off any worsening slump.
The central bank has made it clear that this wasnt releasing the floodwaters by providing a huge stimulus comparable to that introduced in 2009, but it is clear that they are redoubling efforts to stabilize the economy and the currency, Geoffrey Yu, the head of the British investment office of the Swiss Bank UBS, said in an email.
This swift action supports our view that there wont be a sharp deceleration in the Chinese economy this year and that fears of a major global slowdown are overdone, added Mr. Yu.",The Chinese central bank’s move is intended to send a signal that Beijing is ready to stem a slowdown that has darkened the global outlook.,2019-01-04T12:28:50Z,China Pours $218 Billion into the Economy as Growth Slows,The New York Times,0
"Instead of introducing more bans and regulations, we should use our departure from the E.U. to cut taxes, reduce red tape and move away from the big-state European model, said another Brexit supporter, Liz Truss, a senior Treasury minister, in recent remarks published by the Mail on Sunday newspaper. This is a huge opportunity to remake the case for free-market conservatism.
Mr. Rees-Mogg would scrap import tariffs, allowing cheap food and products to flood in, calculating that the economy would be jolted into life by a bracing blast of international competition.
But that comes with huge risks. Not only would farmers fear for their livelihoods, but the idea of admitting United States food imports has sparked a debate about agricultural practices, including hormone-fed beef, chlorinated chicken and standards for the humane treatment of animals.
This idea were going to rip up the rule book, said Ms. Adkins. Thats lovely but, at the same time, is that acceptable to the populace, to consumers?
She added: All it takes is the first kid who swallows a button from a teddy bear because weve thrown the rule book out on safety and therell be an uproar.
Others, including some supporters on the left, see Brexit in more philosophical terms, as a way to reconnect communities with government, bringing decisions closer to the voters. Casting off European rules might allow governments to prop up lossmaking industries or direct procurement contracts to local companies, for example.
These three approaches, however, are incompatible, which implies that trade will become the crucible for a bigger clash of ideas.","Even if Parliament approves the government’s plan, Britain has yet to define its new relationship with Europe.

"Omaha, Neb. — A historic flood emergency in the Midwest has claimed at least two lives in Nebraska and another in Iowa. More than 4,500 people have been evacuated from their homes in Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin. Countless homes and businesses are damaged. 
Strained levees gave way, inundating hundreds of homes with walls of water and forcing those evacuations. 
""They were telling everybody, just grab what you can and get out,"" said Gerald Simpson.
James Wilke, 50, died trying to rescue stranded motorists. An 80-year-old woman, Betty Hamernik, was killed as floodwaters filled her home and 55-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan was found submerged. 
One hundred flood-related road closures left entire towns cut off.

"The deputies, from the Horry County Sheriffs Office, had been told to safely transport the patients to a mental health center in September, as Hurricane Florence drenched the Carolinas. They were not being evacuated from the floodwaters, but being moved from hospitals for further treatment.
One of the patients, Nicolette Green, 43, had schizophrenia and had been committed on the recommendation of her counselor. The other, Wendy Newton, 45, had asked to be taken to a hospital because she thought she was about to have a spell. Both women sought out treatment, hoping to feel better, their families said.
Law enforcement officers were assigned to drive them to the mental health center, as is routine under state law. As water levels rose and roads shut down, Mr. Flood and Mr. Bishop were provided a travel route that was believed to be safe, a probable cause affidavit said.
But the deputies did not take the path recommended by their supervisors, according to the affidavit. Instead, the authorities said, they took an alternate route, passing through a barricade and driving into floodwaters on Highway 76 in Marion County in northeastern South Carolina.",2 Ex-Deputies Charged After Patients Drowned in Sheriff’s Van During Hurricane Florence The New York Times Two former sheriff's deputies in South Carolina were charged on Friday in the deaths of two mental health patients who became trapped in a van and drown…,2019-01-04T19:38:50Z,2 Ex-Deputies Charged After Patients Drowned in Sheriff’s Van During Hurricane Florence - The New York Times,The New York Times,0

"(CNN)People living near the Russian River in Northern California's Sonoma County were ordered to evacuate Tuesday ahead of possible flooding. 
The Russian River is expected to rise about 14 feet over the next day, according to an alert sent by Sonoma County Emergency Services.
The river is expected to reach flood stage Tuesday evening and crest Wednesday night near record-level, Sonoma County Sheriff Sgt. Spencer Crum said. The sheriff's office said the river is projected to crest at 46.1 feet on Wednesday night. 
Potentially thousands of people will be affected, not necessarily because of direct flooding, but stranded because of flooded roads, according to Crum.
Areas are already being affected, and the National Weather Service expects heavy rainfall over the next couple of days.
The record crest for the Russian River is 49.50 feet in 1986, according to the National Weather Service.

"Residents in Kansas and Missouri were steeling themselves Monday for the deadly and “unprecedented” flooding that's already saturated large portions of the Midwest, mangling hundreds of homes and raising the Missouri River above record water levels in many areas.
In Atchison, Kansas, a city with a population of more than 10,000, businesses are reported to be piling up sandbags as the National Weather Service is forecasting river levels to reach 30 feet there later this week – something likely to prompt major flooding.
“It’s not looking good at all,” Sara Tull, a local resident, told KCTV. “I think it’s [going to] get us this time and I hate to say that.”
People view the rising waters from the Platte and Missouri rivers which flooded areas of Plattsmouth, Neb., on Sunday.
NEBRASKA FARMER WHO DIED TRYING TO RESCUE A STRANGER FROM FLOODWATERS IS HAILED AS A HERO
Some of the city’s residents have already left for higher ground. Other communities in states like Nebraska are still reeling Monday from floods that swept through the region in recent days. And serious flooding is expected to continue there over the next few days, despite river depths leveling off in some parts, the Associated Press is reporting.
""This area's had flooding before but not of this magnitude,"" said Greg London of the Sarpy County Sheriff's Office, where 500 homes are estimated to be damaged. ""This is unprecedented.""
The damage in Sarpy County followed breaches of levees along the Platte River on Thursday and Saturday, and a Missouri River levee break on Thursday. The two rivers converge there.
In Iowa, the Missouri River reached 30.2 feet Sunday in Fremont County in the state's far southwestern corner, two feet above the record set in 2011. Around 250 people in the towns of Bartlett and Thurman were being evacuated as levees were breached and overtopped.

""This wasn't a gradual rise,"" Crecelius said. ""It's flowing fast and it's open country — there's nothing there to slow it down.""
EXTREME FLOODING HINDERS RESCUES ACROSS MIDWEST
Lucinda Parker of Iowa Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management told the Associated Press that nearly 2,000 people overall have been evacuated at eight Iowa locations since flooding began late last week.
The floods were prompted by a late-season “bomb cyclone” that brought heavy rains and eventual snowmelt to the Midwest.
Hundreds of people also remain out of their homes in Nebraska, where floodwaters reached record levels at 17 locations.
The Missouri River has flooded Offutt Air Force Base, with about one-third of it underwater on Sunday. Spokeswoman Tech. Sgt. Rachelle Blake told the Omaha World-Herald that 60 buildings, mostly on the south end of the base, have been damaged, including about 30 completely inundated with as much as 8 feet of water.
At least two Nebraskans have died in the floodwaters while nearly 300 more have been rescued.
Aleido Rojas Galan, 52, of Norfolk, was swept away Friday night in southwestern Iowa, when the vehicle he was in went around a barricade. Two others in the vehicle survived — one by clinging to a tree. On Thursday, Nebraska farmer James Wilke, 50, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to try and reach stranded motorists.
Two men remained missing Monday. A Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away. Water also swept away a man after a dam collapse.
Downstream in St. Joseph, Missouri, home to 76,000 people, volunteers are helping to fill sandbags to help secure a levee protecting an industrial area. Calls were out for even more volunteers in hopes of filling 150,000 sandbags by Tuesday, when the Missouri River is expected to climb to 27 feet — 10 feet above technical flood stage.

The rising Mississippi River also was creating concern. The Mississippi was already at major flood level along the Iowa-Illinois border, closing roads and highways and swamping thousands of acres of farmland. Moderate Mississippi River flooding was expected at several Missouri cities, including St. Louis.

"The torrent of water from heavy rainfall spawned by last week's ""bomb cyclone"" and snowmelt has led to devastating flooding across several Midwestern states, including swamping a major Air Force base in Nebraska that's key to the nation’s nuclear attack response.
About one-third of Offutt Air Force Base -- including offices, hangars and nearly 3,000 feet of the base's 11,700-foot runway -- is underwater due to flooding from the Missouri River south of Omaha.

Col. Michael Manion, commander of the 55th Wing, has been providing updates on the flooding on Facebook. As of Tuesday morning, he reported there has been ""slow water regression"" that's allowed some high points that were underwater to be revealed. Disaster recovery crews are expected to arrive by the end of the week to begin work when floodwaters fully recede.
About 60 buildings, mostly on the south side of Offutt Air Force Base, have been damaged by floodwaters.

""The wheels are in motion but remember - it will likely take months and months and the SE side of the base will never look the same,"" he wrote.
Nine aircraft of the 33 reconnaissance jets based at the facility were able to be flown out before the runway was flooded, according to Manion.
One of the planes was a Boeing-made E4-B plane, which is meant to serve as an aerial command center in case of national emergency or destruction of ground bases in an event such as a nuclear attack, Reuters reported.
The base is also the location of the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear arsenal. The Strategic Command headquarters is set on a hill and was not affected by the floods, and neither was its new $1.3 billion building.
Many of the senior leaders from STRATCOM are participating in a worldwide military exercise called Global Lightning, which began Wednesday, according to the World-Herald.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran moved on Saturday to evacuate more towns and villages threatened by floods after forecasts for more rains in the southwest of the country, state television reported, as the nationwide toll from the flooding reached 70. 
Many residents of Susangerd, with a population of about 50,000, and five other communities in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan were being moved to safer areas as officials released water from major river dams, the television reported. 
“An evacuation order has been issued and we are recommending women and children to leave but we are asking the men and youth to stay and help us (in the rescue effort),” the provincial governor, Gholamreza Shariati, told state TV. 
In the neighboring Lorestan province, seven villages threatened by landslides were to be evacuated, the television reported. 
At least 70 people have been killed, the head of the country’s emergency services, Pirhossein Koulivand, told the state news agency IRNA. 
About 1,900 cities and villages have been affected by floods after exceptionally heavy rains since March 19. 
The disaster has left aid agencies struggling to cope and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters. 
The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. 
Iran’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved its oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad. 
As waters continue to submerge villages, the government said it had deployed more mobile medical units to the southern provinces. Around 1,000 people have been airlifted by emergency helicopters to safety in recent days. 
The head of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards reiterated that the armed forces “were using all their power” to minimise damages in Khuzestan. Iranian drilling companies and other energy firms have been assisting rescue efforts in flooded areas, using pumps to remove water.

"SAN FRANCISCO A winter storm that slammed the western U.S. was barreling through California on Tuesday, bringing threats of flooding, avalanches and blinding, blowing snow on roads in the Sierra Nevada.
Heavy rain began falling Monday and the National Weather Service issued flood warnings and flash flood watches for the San Francisco Bay Area and many parts of the Sacramento area into Thursday morning.
The latest storm will be a ""marathon rather than a sprint,"" the weather service predicted.
Some small creeks and streams had flooded and the weather service warned that the Napa and Russian rivers were likely to overflow their banks by Wednesday morning.
However, while some areas could see 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain or more over the next two days — and as much as 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) in some local mountains — the intensity won't be fierce enough to cause devastating mudslides in areas denuded by a string of devastating wildfires, such as Shasta and Lake counties, the weather service said.
Even so, some areas remained on alert. Sonoma County, where some areas were scarred by 2017 wildfires, activated its Emergency Operations Center.
""This is the time to locate your emergency kits and review your evacuation plans with your family,"" said David Rabbitt, chair of the county Board of Supervisors.
In the Sierra Nevada along the California-Nevada line, forecasters warned of possible whiteout conditions from blowing snow in the high passes. The mountains could see up to 8 feet (2.44 meters) of snow at higher elevations and winds gusting to 140 mph (225 kph) over ridgetops.
""Heavy snow and gale force winds will create dangerous avalanche conditions"" into Thursday morning for the Lake Tahoe area, the National Weather Service warned.
Several mountain highways, including Interstate 80 at Donner Summit, were repeatedly closed for short periods Monday because of spinouts or avalanche concerns.
The storm already has barreled through other parts of the West, toppling trucks and trees, triggering power outages and closing roads and schools from Oregon to Montana.
Snow forced flight cancellations at the Portland airport, and prompted a blizzard warning for parts of Montana, where Butte public schools canceled classes Tuesday for the first time in at least 20 years.
Buses were getting stuck, and a superintendent told The Montana Standard that the district's snowplows haven't been able to keep up.
A power outage struck several thousand people in the Reno-Sparks area of Nevada.
The storm is the latest in a string that has dumped record levels of snow and rain this winter.
The culprit is an atmospheric river of moisture coming from north of Hawaii. The phenomenon has become frequent enough that scientists in California are introducing a 1-through-5 scale of intensity for atmospheric rivers, similar to those used to gauge hurricanes.","Fierce winter storm that hit West reaches California Fox News A winter storm driven that slammed the western U.S. was barreling through California on Tuesday, bringing threats of flooding, avalanches and blinding, blowing...

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joaquin Guzman, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, on Tuesday asked a U.S. judge to set aside his conviction for smuggling tons of drugs into the United States and grant a new trial, saying juror misconduct deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. 
In a filing with the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, lawyers for Guzman relied heavily on a Feb. 20 report in Vice News where an unnamed juror said at least five fellow jurors violated the trial judge’s orders by following the case in the media during the 11-week trial. 
The lawyers said this could have exposed jurors to a flood of information not admitted at trial, including reports based on public court filings that Guzman raped girls as young as 13 years old, that tainted their impartiality. Guzman previously denied the rape allegations. 
“We believe that juror misconduct deprived Joaquin of a fair trial in a case in which the defense was extremely restricted to begin with,” Guzman’s lawyers said in a statement on Tuesday. “We look forward to vindicating his rights in a new trial before a jury that will abide by its oath.” 
John Marzulli, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue, whose office prosecuted Guzman, declined to comment. 
Guzman, 61, was convicted on Feb. 12 on all 10 counts he faced, after jurors heard evidence from more than 50 prosecution witnesses, offering an unprecedented look at the inner workings of the Sinaloa Cartel. 
The defendant faces life in prison at his scheduled June 25 sentencing hearing.

"President Donald Trump on Monday afternoon proposed the creation of a new, United States-funded television network to compete with CNN globally. “While CNN doesn’t do great in the United States based on ratings, outside of the U.S. they have very little competition,” Trump tweeted. “Throughout the world, CNN has a powerful voice portraying the United States in an unfair.... and false way. Something has to be done, including the possibility of the United States starting our own Worldwide Network to show the World the way we really are, GREAT!” The president has had a rocky relationship with the network and recently revoked the hard press pass of CNN Chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta. A federal judge later ruled in favor of the network after CNN filed a federal lawsuit. Acosta has since regained access to the White House. Acosta's press pass was suspended earlier this month after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with President Trump during a press conference. Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide and there was brief contact between the two. Later in the day, the White House revoked Acosta’s credential. CNN filed the subsequent suit against the Trump administration, demanding the White House restore the star reporter's press pass, a move White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders labeled “more grandstanding from CNN.” This is a developing story.

"When one hapless fellow invited family and friends to come watch him in a glassblowing demonstration, a bad cut-and-paste omitted the word glass. The result, wrote his wife, was a shocking offer.
Her solution: She made him resend a corrected version of the same message four times. Her hope was that the flood of identical emails would minimize the amount of attention attracted by the first one.
It worked. Happily, we never had any responses to the initial rude offering, she said.
Some people resort to deception. Janet Katz told people she was the victim of a computer virus. I blame a small child son, niece, nephew, whatever, Roanne Martin said.
Sharyn Tom pointed out that you dont have to defuse the fallout alone. Enlist someone you have good rapport with to Reply All to your Reply All, and say something funny to cut the tension, like, Great story, bro, we appreciate the update! she suggests. The other person helps by taking the focus and embarrassment away from you, and pivots into humor or something useful.
In general, though, the wisest course seems to be quick action and a huge helping of humble pie.
I just call it what it is by sending yet another Reply All message like: Well, that was awkward, Sheryl Moore wrote. Usually that is met with kind and understanding replies.
Or, as Cassandra Kiger put it, You own it, make apologies, spend 48 hours in shame, and move on.
Most people endure a botched Reply All episode only once. After that searing experience, youre unlikely to make the same mistake again.
But you can avoid the fiasco in the first place. Heres how:
Enter the address last. Jeff Branzburg has cultivated the habit of clicking Forward, not Reply, when answering messages. That way, the Address box of every reply starts out empty. Compose the email, and only then go back and enter the address(es), he says. This technique requires extra steps, but it guarantees youll never accidentally Reply to All.
Give yourself an Oh no! window. In some email programs, you can set up a freakout delay. Your email will wait 60 seconds (or more) after you click Send, giving you a window in which to realize your gaffe and stop the message in its tracks.
You can set this up in Microsoft Outlook or in Gmail. If youre a Mac person, you need the free version of a plug-in called Mail Butler to add this feature to Apples Mail program.
The oh no filter gives you enough time to correct errors, Gerard Stijntjes notes. Ive shared it around at work and it is helping.
If Microsoft Outlook dominates your email life, as it does in many organizations, you have three additional safety nets at your disposal:
Remove the Reply All button on your end. The Reply All button cant ruin your life if it doesnt exist, can it? In Outlook, you can move the button to a remote Siberian outpost on the toolbar so its harder to hit by mistake. (Heres how to do it.)
The beauty of this toolbar surgery is that it doesnt fully deprive you of the Reply to All function. When you really intend to trigger it, you can always choose the equivalent menu command. Problem solved, as far as Im concerned, Andreas Molke noted.","You know that sinking feeling when you accidentally click ""Reply All"" instead of ""Reply?"" It's awful. Here's how to handle it, and make sure it never happens again.",2019-01-17T22:55:04Z,Crowdwise: How to Handle the Dreaded ‘Reply All Moment’,The New York Times,0
"It was one of three California races in which Mr. Bloombergs organization spent more than $10 million combined. The Democrats supported by Mr. Bloomberg won all three seats. Health care and taxes were major themes of the Bloomberg ads. In Illinoiss 14th Congressional District, a suburban Chicago area, one Bloomberg-funded ad emphasized the Democratic challenger Lauren Underwoods record as a registered nurse who would fight for health care. A separate ad attacked the four-term incumbent, Randy Hultgren, for his vote in favor of the bill limiting deductions for state and local taxes, which the ad claimed would lead to higher taxes for many Chicagoland families. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll a month before the election showed Ms. Underwood trailing Mr. Hultgren; she won by 10,442 votes. In Houston, a media market saturated with political advertising, one ad stood out for its quirkiness. It featured a cartoonlike depiction of the Republican incumbent, Representative John Culberson, riding a spaceship. Mr. Culberson had pushed millions of dollars in funding for a NASA mission to find signs of life on Jupiters moon Europa. John Culberson: Out of this World, the ad trumpeted. The message dovetailed with criticism leveled by Mr. Culbersons Democratic opponent, Lizzie Fletcher, that he had failed to secure proper funding for Houston flood control, showing misplaced priorities.","New York Times How Michael Bloomberg Used His Money to Aid Democratic Victories in the House New York Times A week before the Nov. 6 election, Kendra Horn, a Democratic House candidate in Oklahoma, received unexpected good news from her television consultant:…",2018-11-30T10:00:20Z,How Michael Bloomberg Used His Money to Aid Democratic Victories in the House - New York Times,The New York Times,0
"HAZARDS OF TIME TRAVELBy Joyce Carol Oates 324 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins. $26.99.
Increasingly I wonder whether Joyce Carol Oates is attempting to become Margaret Atwood. Her 40-odd novels, traced over the past 50-odd years, mark an increasing tendency toward dystopia. She is most famous for what one might call novels of small-scale violence, in which individuals might get bloodied (or kidnapped, or sacrificially killed, or implicated in a murder-suicide) but societies usually get off scot-free. Now she has written a thriller in which the murder victim is America.
The violence of Oatess world is excessive, but then again it looks much like our own. Like other prolific authors, Oates has always plucked characters and plot-points from the real world: Jeffrey Dahmer, JonBenet Ramsey, Marilyn Monroe. Oates has a tendency to broadcast the threats that are fashionable, not necessarily the ones most likely to befall us. She makes distorted photocopies of the American psyche: biker gangs, psychotic mothers, amnesiacs, cults, sexual abuse, race riots, serial killers, strippers who are also serial killers. So if the country in Hazards of Time Travel looks a lot like Gilead, that may be the fault of America and not Atwood.
The novel opens with a self-explicating monologue. Sometimes on my knees in a posture of prayer I am able to break through the censor barrier to remember, the protagonist, Adriane, begins. But my brain hurts so! Adriane calls herself an Exile, as quickly explained immediately after: The Exiled Individual (EI) is limited by the Homeland Security Exile Disciplinary Bureau to a 10-mile radius around an assigned residence. A flood of definitions follows. We are told that Mexico and Canada have been reconstituted, the United States Constitution replaced by Patriot Vigilance.
Oates has always said that her primary interest is in personality. A writer like Atwood takes great joy in world-building, but for Oates its a chore to be dispensed with. And so the Cliffs Notes-like introduction is a frantic scrabble to get back into charted territory. We meet Adrianes humble father, forced out of his medical residency for listening sympathetically to a political speech; her weasly brother, Roderick, stuck in a menial job at the Media Dissemination Bureau (MDB); and Adriane herself, first selected valedictorian and then arrested before graduation. How ironic it was, Adriane exclaims. Id been, for those few cruel days, valedictorian of my high school class!","After many blood-filled novels, Oates has written a book, “Hazards of Time Travel,” in which the victim is America.",2018-12-21T10:00:06Z,Fiction: A Dystopian Thriller From Joyce Carol Oates,The New York Times,0

SUBSCRIBE Nov. 30, 2018 / 1:32 AM GMT LOS ANGELES Heavy rains that hit in an area scarred by the deadliest wildfire in recorded California history caused flooding that prompted evacuations of homes and shut down part of a highway on Thursday, officials said. The Butte County Sheriffs Office issued an evacuation order for an area east of Chico, a city near the Camp Fire burn area, after storms dumped as much as 1-and-a-half inches of rain in the area burned by the fire, and after thunderstorms on Thursday dropped another 1 ¼ inches, officials said. Butte County sheriffs Sgt. Brad Meyer told NBC affiliate KNVN of Chico that flooding of several feet stranded some residents in an area near Honey Run Road and Horse Run Lane, that crews were using rafts to reach around 12 homes. ""It is serious. The water is coming up, so we want to make sure we get everybody out that we can,"" he said, adding that the depth was a couple of feet across the road. Rick Carhart, a public information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Butte Unit, said that a swift water rescue team was deployed and three homes were evacuated by boat in that area. An evacuation order remains for the devastated town of Paradise, which was mostly destroyed in the Camp Fire that began on Nov. 8 and is blamed in at least 88 deaths. The flooding on Honey Run Road, and flooding which caused the closure of part of Highway 99 south of Chico, was at least partially caused by runoff from rain that fell in the Camp Fire burn area, which can't absorb the same water as it would have if it hadn't burned, National Weather Service forecaster Cindy Matthews said. Adding to the flooding in areas south of the burn area is a line of thunderstorms that stalled over that area, she said. ""The same areas are repeatedly being hit with moderate to heavy rain,"" Matthews said. The rain in the area was expected to last into the afternoon, she said. @CALFIRE_ButteCo Swiftwater Rescue Team deployed to the Butte Creek Canyon along with other firefighters and used one of the team's boats to evacuate people from three homes in the area. pic.twitter.com/re8PAMeINy CAL FIRE Butte Unit/Butte County Fire Department (@CALFIRE_ButteCo) November 30, 2018 A section of Highway 99 south of Chico was closed due to flooding, transportation officials said.

"Readers looking for a biography of the group will find some of the basics here, but its how Abdurraqib filters the information absorbing it, refracting it through his own distinctive lens that gives this compact book its power. He covers, among other things, A Tribe Called Quests beginnings in Queens; its involvement in the Afrocentric rap collective Native Tongues; and its nadir in the late 90s, when the visionary energy the group brought to bear on its first three albums dissipated into something that started to sound dutiful and desultory.
Two forces hastened A Tribe Called Quests breakup in 1998, according to Abdurraqib. One was large and impersonal, having to do with the state of hip-hop in the 90s, when a flood of money deepened the apparent divide between commercialism and authenticity, presenting artists with a stark choice: Be real enough to stay underground, or go pop enough to get money. He locates A Tribe Called Quest and its wide-ranging appeal at the center of this tug-of-war, with the group getting worn down by the strain.
This smart structural analysis is plausible enough, but what moves Abdurraqib the most is the intense and fractious friendship between two of the groups core members, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg. (Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White are also acknowledged as essential members in the book, but they appear mostly as onlookers to the main emotional drama.)
Abdurraqib remembers identifying with Phife from the start: the scrappy M.C. who mastered the ironic art of the punch line, cutting grandiose bombast with comic self-deprecation. Q-Tip gets respect here for his brilliance and ambition, but Abdurraqib likens him to a perfectionist older brother: demanding and a bit aloof, seemingly oblivious to how hard Phife was trying to prove himself.
The theme of mortality runs through the book, which is billed as a love letter on the cover but could also be called an elegy. Phife died of complications from diabetes in March 2016, just after A Tribe Called Quest had reunited and recorded We Got It From Here Thank You 4 Your Service, their first new album in 18 years. The album was released just before midnight on Nov. 10, 2016, bearing lyrics that sounded veritably prophetic in light of the election results from just a couple of nights before. All you black folks, you must go / All you Mexicans, you must go: What might have constituted biting satire in a more (ostensibly) innocent time was beginning to sound like a news transcript.","“Go Ahead in the Rain,” by the poet and cultural critic Hanif Abdurraqib, is a love letter to the pioneering hip-hop group.",2019-01-30T18:02:19Z,Books of The Times: An Intensely Personal Tribute to A Tribe Called Quest,The New York Times,0
"(Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence is due to travel to Nebraska on Tuesday to tour the devastation left by floods in the Midwest which have killed at least three people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. 
Media reports including CNN say that 74 of Nebraska’s 93 counties had declared states of emergency by early Tuesday. 
“This is clearly the most widespread disaster we have had in our state’s history,” in terms of sheer size, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts told reporters on Monday afternoon. 
Ricketts will join Pence as he surveys the damage, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Twitter late on Monday. Pence is traveling at U.S. President Donald Trump’s request, she said. 
The flood water have been driven by snow melt from heavy rains last week and warm temperatures said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. 
“Most of the snow pack in Nebraska is now gone, but up river in North and South Dakota, there’s significant snow pack of up to 20 plus inches and it’s melting,” he said. 
The Missouri River, the longest in North America, has flooded much of Nebraska between Omaha and Kansas City at the Missouri state line. 
The river was expected to crest at more than 47 feet (14.5 meters) on Tuesday, breaking the previous record, set in 2011, by more than a foot, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said in the latest bulletin on its web page. 
At least one person was missing on Monday in addition to the three reported deaths. 
State officials said Monday that 290 people had been rescued by the Nebraska State Patrol, National Guard troops, and urban search and rescue teams. 
Damage to the state’s livestock sector was estimated at about $400 million, while the full impact on the spring planting season was not yet clear, said Steve Wellman, director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. 
The state’s highway system suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, said Kyle Schneweis, director of the state Department of Transportation.

Tritt then gave the shoes to people impacted by the recent Nebraska floods. ""I wanted them to go to people who actually needed them,"" Tritt told CBS News Tuesday.

The West Virginia woman who made national headlines in 2016 when she was placed on leave from a county development organization over a demeaning Facebook post about then-first lady Michelle Obama has now pleaded guilty to defrauding the Federal Emergency Management Agency out of thousands of dollars of disaster benefits.
Pamela Taylor, 57, admitted on Tuesday that she falsely registered for more than $18,000 in FEMA disaster benefits after historic flooding in Clay County, West Virginia, in June 2016 that killed 23 people, the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement.
Taylor claimed that her primary residence was damaged in the flood and that she was staying in a rental property, the prosecutor's office said. Her home was not damaged, however, and she still lived there.
""The flood was a natural disaster,"" U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart said in the statement. ""Stealing from FEMA is a manmade disaster.""
In her plea agreement, Taylor agreed to pay restitution of $18,149.04.
She faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 when she is sentenced on May 30.
Taylor could not immediately be reached for comment.
Taylor's name and residences match those of the Pamela Taylor who was fired from her job as director of the Clay County Development Corporation after the November 2016 Facebook post, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
Taylor published a controversial post about Obama following Donald Trump's election as president that said: ""It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.""

"HOUSTON Dan Crenshaws good eye is good enough, but its not great. The iris is broken. The retina is scarred. He needs a special oversized contact lens, plus bifocals sometimes, to correct his vision. Six years after getting blown up, he can still see a bit of debris floating in his cornea. His bad eye well, his bad eye is gone. Under his eyepatch is a false eye that is entirely deep blue. One solid color. At the center of it, where a pupil should be, is the gold trident symbol of the Navy SEALs. It makes Dan Crenshaw look like a Guardian of the Galaxy. He cant catch a ball very well anymore. He misses plenty of handshakes; his arm shortchanges the reach, his palm fumbles the grip. And he has trouble with dumb little tasks he needs to touch a pitcher to a cup to properly pour a glass of water, for example. But nothing major. Nothing that would prevent him from coming out of nowhere, unknown and underfunded, to vanquish seven opponents in a Republican primary, then squash a state legislator in a runoff, and then on Tuesday, at age 34, win his first-ever general election to represent his native Houston area in Congress. Hell join a freshman class with two dozen other new House members who are under 40, and at least 15 who are veterans. Yet Crenshaw seems poised to stand out his potent life story, his striking presence and his military and Ivy League credentials setting him up as a rising star for a Republican party in bad need of one, after losing what could turn out to be three dozen seats after the dust settles. Thirty-six hours after his election-night triumph, Crenshaw still hadnt caught up on sleep. There was some stale cake sitting in his campaign office, and he was juggling phone calls and a haircut he was going to be late for. He just left a luncheon with business leaders and was due early the next morning for a veterans ceremony. In two days he would make a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live, before heading to Capitol Hill for a two-week orientation. A whirlwind to everyone else, it seemed, but him. Its life, Crenshaw said, sitting at a conference table in his Houston office last week. Its not a challenge. He was the picture of calm. The eyepatch was off. The gold trident sparkled. Behind him was a large framed photo of Ronald Reagan. Ahead of him was the next mission. Weirdly, his election wasn't the biggest news in Crenshaw's life last week. That came in the first minutes of Sunday, Nov. 4, during the ""Weekend Update"" portion of ""Saturday Night Live,"" when cast member Pete Davidson, riffing on the midterms, presented a photo of Crenshaw, eyepatch on. You may be surprised to hear hes a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit-man in a porno movie, the comedian joked. Im sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever. [ SNLs Pete Davidson hasnt apologized for mocking a GOP candidate who lost an eye in war ] The studio audience laughed, but everyone else took to their soapboxes. How dare liberal jokesters malign an American hero! How dare conservatives put constraints on comedy! A wave of national media came his way and Crenshaw, appearing on CNN and Fox News, was cool as a cucumber. He wasnt offended. He was just disappointed that the joke was so lame and unfunny. Then, he says, SNL creator Lorne Michaels called to apologize and invite him on the show. Crenshaw hesitated. Hes not an entertainer. And he had Veterans Day events over the weekend. But he saw a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share a clear message with a national audience. After roasting Davidson in classic SNL fashion (This is Pete Davidson. He looks like if the meth from Breaking Bad was a person), Crenshaw took a moment. But, seriously, theres a lot of lessons to learn here, Crenshaw said, addressing the camera as he sat next to Davidson. Not just that the left and right can still agree on some things but also this: Americans can forgive one another. We can remember what brings us together as a country. He encouraged Americans to connect with veterans by telling them, Never forget, instead of just thanks for your service. When you say never forget to a veteran, you are implying that, as an American, you are in it with them.... And never forget those we lost on 9/11 heroes like Petes father, a firefighter who died in the World Trade Center. So Ill just say, Pete? Never forget. Never forget, Davidson replied. Crenshaw's father's career in the oil-and-gas industry took the family to Ecuador and Colombia, where Crenshaw went to high school and learned Spanish. Captivated as a child by the SEAL memoir ""Rogue Warrior,"" he was commissioned as a naval officer in 2006 and underwent SEAL training, fracturing his tibia during hell week but completing the challenge on his second go-round. He deployed twice to Iraq and then, in 2012, to Afghanistan. On June 15, 2012, when Crenshaw was 28, he and his platoon choppered into Helmand Province on a last-minute mission to support Marine special ops. At the time, Helmand was littered with improvised explosive devices. Bombs were so ever-present that it was safer to crouch in place during oncoming fire and wager on a snipers uncertain aim than to dive for cover onto uncertain ground. While Crenshaws platoon moved to secure a compound, an Afghan interpreter named Raqman, who wanted to become a Navy SEAL himself, responded to a call and crossed in front of Crenshaw. Raqman stepped on a pressure plate, triggering 15 pounds of explosives and suffering fatal injuries. A couple paces back, Crenshaw felt like he was hit by a truck while being shot at by a firing squad. On the ground, his eyes were numb. The rest of his body screamed like it had been scratched open and doused in Tabasco. He reached down and felt his legs. Good sign. He had no vision, but assumed his eyes were just filled with dirt. A medic friend began assessing the damage. Dude, dont ever get blown up, Crenshaw said to him. It really sucks. [ From a cheerful Texas stadium to an anxious Boston party, heres what the 2020 starting line felt like. ] He refused to be carried on a stretcher, because he didnt want to expose comrades to enemy fire for no good reason. He walked under his own power to a medevac, where he was put into a coma. He woke up in Germany a few days later, blind and swollen. The remains of his right eye had been surgically removed; eventually a copper wire would be pulled out of his left. Doctors said there was a chance he might see again, but for Crenshaw it was a certainty. Seeing again became his mission, and that sense of mission helped him endure the hallucinations, the surgeries, the weeks he had to spend face down and sightless while his eye healed, and the two years it took for a medical bureaucracy to get him to a place of relative comfort. He remembered how his mother, who died of cancer when he was 10, never complained during her five-year struggle with the illness. He held fast to his sense that life is about mission; you need one in order to live, and to live productively. Just over a year after his injury, he married his longtime girlfriend, Tara. He deployed twice more, to Bahrain and South Korea, as troop commander of an intelligence team. In various commendations, the Navy cited him for his zealous initiative, wise judgment and unswerving determination. Medically retired in 2016, Crenshaw then earned a masters degree in public administration from the Harvard Kennedy School. In 2017 he returned to Houston for the first significant chunk of time since he was a child to help with recovery after Hurricane Harvey. And then, while Crenshaw was looking for a policy job on Capitol Hill, an adviser to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) took one look at him and, before they even sat down to talk, told him to run for office. The day before, Rep. Ted Poe (R) had announced his retirement from Texass second district, which starts in Houston and curves around the city like a sickly tadpole. It was kismet. He said he wanted to run for office one day, but wanted to get policy experience first, says a Capitol Hill aide who ended up advising the campaign (and requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly). I was like, Have you paid attention to some of the people we have up here? You dont need that.... And he went all in. Its the SEAL ethos. It was amazing to watch. The campaign started last November, four months before the Republican primary. I had never heard of him before he arrived. I would venture to say most people had never heard of him, says Vlad Davidiuk, communications director for the Harris County Republican Party. The district has changed demographically, and is no longer as solid red as it used to be. It required a candidate who was willing to campaign hard.... What distinguished Dan Crenshaw most is his ability to engage with voters. Over five days in February, Crenshaw laced up his sneakers and ran 100 miles through the district, campaigning along the way. Thanks to a surge in day-of voting for the crowded primary, he snuck into second place by 155 votes, besting an opponent who had spent millions of her personal fortune. By then, his personal story was resonating. His face was both recognizable and symbolic. Most Texas Republicans arent very exciting, says Mark P. Jones, a political-science professor at Rice University, in Crenshaws district. None of them are very compelling or appealing. Theyre just sort of random old white dudes. And Dan Crenshaw was something new and different.

"Making good on a longstanding threat, President Trump moved this weekend to cut direct aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, whose citizens are fleeing north and overwhelming U.S. resources -- including as part of organized caravans that the White House has warned may eventually lead to the closure of the entire southern border with Mexico.
The dramatic step comes just days after Mexican Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero warned ominously that ""the mother of all caravans"" could be coming soon from the three nations.
""We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they're calling 'the mother of all caravans,' and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,"" Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday. A much smaller group of approximately 40 migrants left over the weekend, and a separate caravan of nearly 2,500 is currently making its way through Mexico.
OBAMA DHS CHIEF ADMITS 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER
And former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged Saturday that America has a “crisis” at the southern border, and that the number of apprehensions exceed anything he encountered during his time serving under former President Barack Obama.
Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10B in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""..Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

On Saturday, the State Department put those words into action, and notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations, which have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border.
In tweets posted Saturday, Trump blamed Democrats and Mexico for problems at the border and beyond, saying progressives are concerned only with changing domestic demographics to ensure more liberal voters.
""It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws,"" Trump tweeted Saturday. ""In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. But the Dems don't care about the crime, they don't want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!'
As far as Mexico's role, he tweeted: ""Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out &amp; we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!""
The move comes as Trump, newly vindicated after the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia collusion probe, vowed to secure the borders and halt incoming caravans during a fiery rally earlier in the week.
When reporters asked Trump on Friday what closing the border could entail, he said ""it could mean all trade"" with Mexico and added, ""We will close it for a long time.""
Trump has been promising for more than two years to build a long, impenetrable wall along the border to stop illegal immigration, though Congress has been reluctant to provide the money he needs. In the meantime, he has repeatedly threatened to close the border, but this time, with a new group of migrants heading north, he gave a definite timetable and suggested a visit to the border within the next two weeks.
A substantial closure could have an especially heavy impact on cross-border communities from San Diego to South Texas, as well as supermarkets that sell Mexican produce, factories that rely on imported parts, and other businesses across the U.S.

The U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said closing the border would be ""an unmitigated economic debacle"" that would threaten 5 million American jobs.
New Jersey Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke out Saturday against cutting off aid to Central America, declaring that ""foreign assistance is not charity; it advances our strategic interests and funds initiatives that protect American citizens.""
And a group of House Democrats visiting El Salvador denounced the administration's decision to cut aid to the region.
""As we visit El Salvador evaluating the importance of U.S. assistance to Central America to address the root causes of family and child migration, we are extremely disappointed to learn that President Trump intends to cut off aid to the region,"" said the statement from five lawmakers, including Rep. Eliot L. Engel of New York, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""The President's approach is entirely counterproductive.""

The Trump administration has threatened before to scale back or cut off U.S. assistance to Central America. Congress has not approved most of those proposed cuts, however, and a report this year by the Congressional Research Service said any change in that funding would depend on what Congress does.
MEXICO WARNS OF IMPENDING 'MOTHER OF ALL CARAVANS'
Short of a widespread border shutdown, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. might close designated ports of entry to re-deploy staff to help process parents and children. Ports of entry are official crossing points that are used by residents and commercial vehicles.

Many people who cross the border illegally ultimately request asylum under U.S. law, which does not require asylum seekers to enter at an official crossing. Most people who make asylum claims are eventually rejected, because asylum applicants must show a specific and credible fear of persecution -- it is not enough to merely claim that conditions back home are economically dire.
Border officials are also reportedly planning to more than quadruple the number of asylum seekers sent back over the border to wait out their immigration cases, from 60 to nearly 250.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Friday his country was doing its part to fight migrant smuggling. Criminal networks charge thousands of dollars a person to move migrants through Mexico, increasingly in large groups toward remote sections of the border.
""We want to have a good relationship with the government of the United States,"" Lopez Obrador said. He added: ""We are going to continue helping so that the migratory flow, those who pass through our country, do so according to the law, in an orderly way.""

Alejandra Mier y Teran, executive director of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce in San Diego, said the mere threat of border closures sends the wrong message to businesses in Mexico and may eventually scare companies into turning to Asia for their supply chains.
""I think the impact would be absolutely devastating on so many fronts,"" said Mier y Teran, whose members rely on the Otay Mesa crossing to bring televisions, medical devices and a wide range of products to the U.S. ""In terms of a long-term effect, it's basically shooting yourself in your foot. It's sending out a message to other countries that, 'Don't come because our borders may not work at any time.' That is extremely scary and dangerous.""

"Chico, California (CNN) First they were driven from their homes by the deadly Camp Fire in Northern California. Now, if it rains, they could be flooded out of their tent city, which has sprung up in a Walmart parking lot. That possibility of flooding from rain is one concern that has authorities working to relocate the estimated hundreds of wildfire evacuees who have taken refuge at the parking lot 10 minutes down the hill from the town of Paradise, which is now little more than acres of charred ruins. As thousands of people packed into shelters in Butte County after their homes were destroyed, many others were left without a place to go. The Walmart in Chico was where many Paradise residents shopped, a familiar place where they felt safe and comfortable. So they slept there in tents and cars. What started as a temporary shelter for those escaping the fire has turned into a makeshift village. Volunteers have been stationed at the parking lot handing out everything from smoke masks to dog food to clothes and other essentials. There are several portable toilets on site, although people have to go elsewhere to shower. A whiteboard on site tells people where else they can go to find shelter and lists names of those missing from the fire. A poster provides information about free available shuttles, discount codes for Lyft rides and the number to call if longer rides are needed. Alex Hader, co-owner of the Sexy Panda food truck based in Sacramento, came to the parking lot with co-owner Kristina Wheeler last Friday and the two have been there ever since. The truck is open 24/7, offering breakfast burritos, burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches for free to anyone who needs food, at any hour. ""We didn't plan on being out here this long,"" Hader said. ""We didn't plan on it turning into something like this either. We just got the thought in our head to come out here and feed some people that need it."" They say their experience at the tent city has been life-changing. ""There's so many people out here that are just broken right now, and the way everybody's coming together with all the donations,"" Wheeler said. ""Even the people who are affected by the fire directly, they're helping. They're donating."" Though donations from the community have poured in and volunteers have come from all over, local organizers recognize that the tent city wasn't meant to last. ""It was always a short-term solution,"" Rob Busick, one of the grassroots organizers of the volunteer efforts, told CNN. ""A lot of people didn't have anything as they came down here, so our immediate need was just to care and show compassion for these people."" Temperatures in Chico are set to get cooler this week and weather forecasts call for rain. The tent city is susceptible to flooding since it's at the bottom of a hill, so organizers say it's important that people sheltering there relocate. ""I know that losing what they've lost and also transitioning into a parking lot and doing it again is a difficult conversation, but the health and safety of them has been No. 1 since Day One,"" Busick said. Butte County officials announced they were working with the city of Chico, the American Red Cross and volunteers to move evacuees in the tent city to an open shelter at Butte County Fairgrounds in Gridley. The county will provide transportation to the new shelter starting Saturday, and the shelter will begin taking in small animals Sunday, according to a news release. Both Butte County and Walmart said rumors that people would be kicked out of the tent city on Sunday were untrue. A county spokesperson said the relocation efforts are because of health, safety and weather concerns. ""Our priority is making sure we get fire-displaced residents into a place where they'll be protected from the weather elements, where services are available, and making sure they're connected to services,"" the spokesperson said. Those services include ongoing updates about the fire and recovery efforts as well as basic needs such as toilets, showers and food. Finding available shelter space has been a challenge for the county. According to its website, one more shelter in addition to the one in Gridley is open and accepting evacuees. But five others are either full or not taking in any more people because of a norovirus outbreak. The Camp Fire has destroyed about 9,800 homes, according to the latest estimate from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. CNN's Meridith Edwards and Kaylee Hartung reported from Chico, and Harmeet Kaur reported and wrote from New York.

"The authors have done a remarkable amount of research. The hardcover includes over 100 pages of notes; the list of source materials runs 14 pages. Listening to the audiobook, mostly (and commandingly) read by Courtney B. Vance, one is freed from any responsibility to flip back and forth between primary text and notes, creating a wonderful immersion in that extraordinary research. Vance whose impressive acting career includes multiple military roles, most famously in The Hunt for Red October signals the transitions to lengthy direct quotes with helpful changes of tone, and most of the book is strongly and engagingly acted. The only rough spots are when Vances inflections or pauses suggest he may be unsure of the meaning of some of the books more technical passages. The book is clearly organized by scientifically minded authors. While varied and associative enough to be interesting, the writing is always directed toward illuminating the research. But there is literary flair to the language as well. Emanuel Leutzes famous painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, one of many that illustrate the historical cooperation between astronomy and war, is described with Washington standing at the front, his right leg planted on the bow as the multiethnic crew of revolutionaries struggles with poles and oars in the ice-choked river and light begins to flood the morning sky. At the commanders left side hangs a saber; in his right hand is a telescope. The language moves between the literary and analytical, evenhanded yet passionate. This is not to say the authors dont have a point of view, about which they are transparent from the onset, but the book lets the facts, and the many first-person quotes, speak for themselves. To be an informed citizen is a daunting task. We cannot all read reams of military white papers to track the evolving thinking about space dominance or dig up Galileos first treatise from 1610. Accessory to War condenses multiple bodies of work into one important, comprehensive and coherent story of the symbiotic developments of astrophysics and war. The authors are clear and convincing that war from the high ground of space is exponentially more dangerous than any warfare the human race has engaged in thus far, capable of efficiently delivering nuclear bombs, with their power to annihilate the entire planet. They are equally convincing that scientific space endeavors arent separable from military ones, and they never were. The lesson is not merely a wake-up call for astrophysicists, but for all of us, for anyone with the misapprehension that science somehow marches on separate from the rest of culture.","In “Accessory to War,” the astrophysicist offers a history of space exploration and the ways it has been aided and abetted by warfare and its needs.",2018-11-12T19:15:04Z,Audiobooks: Neil deGrasse Tyson Explores the Symbiosis Between War and Astrophysics,The New York Times,0
"MALIBU, Calif. -- Thousands of people in California were under evacuation orders Friday morning because of rushing floodwaters and mudslides. Some areas were already digging out from the muck and debris. Residents of the areas hardest hit by the deadly wildfires are the most at risk of having their homes destroyed. CBS News correspondent Cater Evans said the city of Malibu got a solid day of rain, and more was still on the way in parts of California. That's a big concern in the burn areas. In the mountains around Malibu, there's nothing left on the hillsides to hold the dirt in place. Heavy downpours across Southern California prompted flash flood warnings and mandatory evacuations for about 4,000 homes. Once the rain slowed, piles of mud, ash and debris blocked several roads. Highways were slick and there were a lot of accidents. The Malibu area is not used to so much rain all at once. In Northern California, many people affected by the deadly Camp Fire were forced to evacuate again, this time because of rising flood waters. First responders had to rescue several residents in Butte County. A Los Angeles firefighter rescued a man clinging to tree in the rushing water of L.A. River. He was later treated for hypothermia. Evans said California was due to get a break from the rain on Friday, before it comes back again on Saturday. Fortunately the weekend's weather is not expected to be as strong as this last storm.","Hills and mountains stripped of vegetation by devastating wildfires can't hold soil in place, leading to mudslides along with the floodwater",2018-11-30T12:34:36Z,Thousands evacuated as flash floods hit fire-ravaged California,CBS News,1
"Almost half of the country lives near a levee, and 12 have already failed during spring flooding 
Critics blame Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA for broken levees flooding the Midwest
The levees ""were set up to fail,"" says flood insurance expert
The small town of Hamburg, Iowa was submerged this week when its levee – the earthen barrier protecting it from the raging Missouri River – broke, forcing its 1,100 residents to flee their homes. But luck was on their side: No one died. And now this same raging river is rushing toward Kansas City, Missouri.
The Army Corps of Engineers warned during a Thursday briefing there could be other flooding as snow begins to melt along the upper regions of the Midwest. The states most likely to be affected: Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri.
""The runoff will be more than expected,"" John Remus, chief of the Missouri River Basin Water Management Division confirmed during the briefing. Twelve levees have already been breached, others have been ""overtopped."" And still others are in danger. ""The public needs to remain vigilant.""
""The whole thing is trashed,"" said Pat Sheldon, who is president of a regional ""levee district"" that extends from Iowa to the Missouri border. He predicted that doing a ""total rebuild"" of his levee system alone could cost ""several billion dollars.""
Repairing levees damaged by Midwest flooding could cost billions
There are nearly 100,000 miles of levees across the country, protecting almost 150 million people, and when they fail, it can be disastrous.
Others who've witnessed the misfortune of a levee rupturing weren't so lucky. The biggest tragedy occurred in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when a dike that was supposed to protect the city gave way and 1,300 people died. And a recent Christmas flood in 2015 set records for water height all along the Mississippi.
These disasters haven't gone unnoticed. In 2016, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional watchdog, scolded the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for making ""little progress"" in ensuring the safety of the nation's levees. The Corps of Engineers, which inspects just a small portion of these earth and gravel barriers, said at least five percent were at very high risk of flooding.
The Corps of Engineers controls just 15 percent of the nation's levees, while the rest are under state, local and tribal jurisdiction. But mistakes have been made regarding the levees the Corps of Engineers controls. When Hamburg built up its levee, Army officials ordered it be lowered. The flood water easily overwhelmed the lowered barrier wiping out the town. In New Orleans, the Corps of Engineers helped create a shipping channel dubbed ""Mr. Go,"" but it ended up funneling Katrina's flood water into the city.
And it's unlikely anything will change when the current flooding ends. ""Extreme weather events linked to climate change are causing flooding that strains aging infrastructures and produces even more damage,"" says Executive Director Amy Bach of United Policyholders, a consumer insurance advocacy group. ""Repairs don't garner attention because they aren't showy. There's no ribbon cutting.""
""You can't continue to maintain these levees on a shoestring,"" says John Dickson, a flood expert with Aon, an international insurance brokerage and consulting firm. ""They were set up to fail.""","There are 100,000 miles of earth and gravel levees across the U.S. and at least 5% are at very high risk of flooding",2019-03-22T14:39:05Z,Midwest's ruptured levees could cost billions to repair,CBS News,1
"Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on  Tuesday afternoon took aim at a mainstream news article, dismissing it as “gossip.”
She tweeted: “One disappointment about DC is the gossip that masquerades as ‘reporting.’ This story has: - Not a SINGLE named or verifiable source - Only ONE on-the-record comment, which is a denial. My dad had a name for junk articles like this: ‘Birdcage lining.’”
The tweet was attached to a Politico story titled,: “Ocasio-Cortez weighs a new primary target: Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries, the newly elected No. 5 Democrat in the House, has drawn criticism from the left since the party's leadership elections.”
The news outlet’s vice president of marketing and communications, Brad Dayspring, stood by Politico’s journalism: “It’s hard to know what the criticism of the piece is, since the congresswoman-elect doesn’t specify (nor has she or anyone from her staff asked for a correction). We stand by our reporting.”
The article claimed the Democratic socialist from the Bronx “has recruited an African-American woman to challenge Jeffries, who was just elected ... as caucus chairman — the No. 5 House Democratic leadership position.”
JUDGE NAP: SUPREME COURT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL DECISION SINCE WORLD WAR II
Democrats recently elected fresh faces to lower-level leadership jobs, including Jeffries, who is in his 40s and is viewed by some as a rising star.
The article, citing anonymous sources, claimed Jeffries was seen as too conservative for a far-left group called Justice Democrats, seeking future bids to run primary candidates against moderate Democrats in coming elections.
Jeffries responded to the challenge in Politico, saying, ""It’s a free country and democracy is a beautiful thing.”

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while selling her ""Green New Deal"", said that the world will end in 12 years if nothing is done to address climate change.
""Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z... we’re like: ‘The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change,'"" Ocasio-Cortez said in January.
But similar past predictions – even by the most prestigious experts – have failed to pan out. Here are ten of the biggest doomsday prediction failures:
1: GLOBAL WARMING TO WIPE NATIONS ""OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH"" IF CLIMATE CHANGE NOT ADDRESSED BY YEAR 2000
In 1989, the Associated Press relayed a warning from a U.N. official:
""A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.""
The official was Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, who added: ""Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands.”
Instead, U.S. and global farm production rose, and more than 1 billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty due to economic growth.
CHERNOBYL ‘MAY STILL BE KILLING US’ AS BOOK WARNS DISASTER MIGHT BE BEHIND ‘GLOBAL RISE IN CANCER AND DISEASE’
No nations were “wiped off the face of the Earth” as of 2019.
However, those worried about warming caution that the U.N. official’s prediction was nuanced.
“He is not saying that entire nations are going to be wiped off the face of the earth by the year 2000,” Joe Romm, a Senior Fellow at American Progress, told Fox News.
“He is saying that if we don’t dramatically reverse emissions by the year 2000 — then we are not going to be able to avoid future flooding,” Romm said.
“It now seems inevitable that a number of island nations will be wiped off the face of the earth because we didn’t act in time,” he added.
According to NASA, global sea levels rose 3.5 inches in the 25 years since 1993, when it began reporting satellite data on sea levels.
The world’s lowest-lying country is the Maldives, a collection of Pacific islands with a population of just over 400,000, where the highest point in the country is 7.9 feet above sea level, with much of it below 3 feet.
2: MASS STARVATION BY 1975
In 1967, a best-selling book came out called “Famine 1975! America’s Decision: Who Will Survive?”
It predicted mass starvation around the developing world due to increasing population. “Today’s crisis can move in only one direction – toward catastrophe,” it warned.
Some experts praised the book and ridiculed doubters.
TROPICAL TECTONIC COLLISIONS MAY HAVE UNLEASHED ANCIENT ICE AGES
“All serious students of the plight of the underdeveloped nations agree that famine... is inevitable,” Cal Tech biology professor Peter Bonner wrote in a 1967 review of the book in the prestigious journal Science.
The exact opposite of the book’s prediction happened. Famine deaths plunged dramatically as farming technology improved, communist countries began allowing private property again, and the globe became further connected.
According to a dataset put together by Our World in Data, more people died of famine in the single decade prior to the book’s release than in all 52 years since it was published.
Yet the book got widespread praise from experts. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, now President of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University, said in 1968 that the book “may be remembered as one of the most important books of our age.”
3: GLOBAL FREEZING AS DANGEROUS AS NUCLEAR WAR
Global cooling was once a worry to many, such as University of California at Davis professor Kenneth Watt, who warned that present trends would make the world “eleven degrees colder in the year 2000 ... about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”
British science writer Nigel Calder was just as worried. ""The threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind,” Calder warned in International Wildlife magazine in 1975.
ICE SAMPLES REVEAL A MASSIVE SUN STORM HIT EARTH IN ANCIENT TIMES ... AND IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN
That quote was dug up by George Mason University economist Walter E. Williams, who argues that there are so many apocalyptic predictions because “they have an agenda for more government control ... fear about the environment is a way to gain government control,” Williams told Fox News.
“Communism and socialism have lost respectability, so it’s been repackaged as environmentalism,” he added.
“It’s like watermelons -- green on the outside, red on the inside.”
4: MASSIVE WARMING BY THE YEAR 2000
The same U.N. official who predicted the loss of entire nations by the year 2000 also claimed: ""the most conservative scientific estimate [is] that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years.”
But looking back from 2019, the temperature rose about half of a degree Celsius since 1989, according to NASA.
HAUNTING PHOTOS SHOW DOZENS OF GAS MASKS LITTERING CHERNOBYL AS NATURE RECLAIMS NUCLEAR PLANT BLAST SITE
Romm says that, regardless of what that U.N. official may have said, the projections issued in the U.N.’s official reports have been good.
“All of the major scientific assessments of global warming have become more dire over time because greenhouse gas emissions have until very recently kept rising at a worst-case scenario rate,” Romm said.
Many who worry about global warming acknowledge that some past predictions have been overblown, but say they hope that doesn’t distract people from the reality that the earth is warming due to man – if more slowly and less catastrophically than some have predicted.
“There have been predictions that have turned out not to come true,” John P. Abraham, a Professor at the University of St. Thomas who has published papers on climate change, told Fox News. “But ... the majority of climate science was proven right.”
6: AL GORE SAYS 10 YEARS ARE LEFT IN 2006
In 2006, while promoting his movie “An Inconvenient Truth”, Al Gore said that humanity had only 10 years left before the world would reach a point of no return.
Gore’s movie also featured animations of water inundating Manhattan and Florida.
EVE OF DESTRUCTION: DOOMSDAY CLOCK HOVERS AT 2 MINUTES TO 'MIDNIGHT'
Yet Gore’s critics point out that just a few years later, he bought an $8 million beach-front property near Los Angeles.
“I wish the climate catastrophists practiced what they preached and sold me their beachfront property at a steep discount,” Alex Epstein, author of “The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels” told Fox News.
7: ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE WILL CAUSE “NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST” BY THE YEAR 2000
In 1982, U.N. official Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the UN Environment Program, warned:
“By the turn of the century, an environmental catastrophe will witness devastation as complete, as irreversible, as any nuclear holocaust.”
ASTEROID THAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS CAUSED A MILE-HIGH TSUNAMI AROUND THE EARTH
No such disaster occurred.
8: MASS EXTINCTION BY 1995
In 1970, Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D-Wisc.) – often considered the “father of Earth Day” – cited the secretary of the Smithsonian, who “believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”

A 2011 notice from the National Science Foundation quotes researcher Anthony Barnosky at UC Berkeley, who said: ""So far, only 1 to 2 percent of all species have gone extinct in the groups we can look at clearly, so by those numbers it looks like we are not far down the road to extinction.”
Barnosky still expressed concern over a long time horizon, saying that 75 percent of species could go extinct “in as little as 3 to 22 centuries.”

10: THE REAL REASON?
Economist Walter E. Williams says environmentalists have occasionally tipped their hand about what motivates their predictions.
""We have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have,” Stephen Schneider, a professor of Biology at Stanford University, said to Discover magazine in 1989. “Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.”
END OF DAYS? TELESCOPE IMAGES REVEAL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GALAXIES COLLIDE
Williams also cites Senator Timothy Wirth, a Democrat from Colorado, who said in 1988: ""We've got to ... try to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong ... we will be doing the right thing anyway in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.""
Williams finds the exaggerated predictions of some environmentalists unacceptable.
“Lying is never okay. To mislead people is never okay,” he told Fox News.
“You can mislead kids and tell them there is Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. But don’t treat adults as children.”

"After breaking up, Willa and Hesper each travel, separately, to the Old World, to discover their roots and soothe their heartache. Willa signs up for an INSPIRING JEWISH SURVIVOR TRIP! to concentration camps in Germany (a plausible internet marketing tactic, though perhaps without the exclamation point), while Hesper travels with her family to Tbilisi, Georgia, to learn about her grandfathers past.
The novel belongs to a growing genre of books about young Jewish Americans exploring their Eastern European backgrounds to better understand themselves in the company of Nicole Krausss The History of Love, Dara Horns The World to Come and, most similarly, Jonathan Safran Foers delightful Everything Is Illuminated, in which a young Jewish American travels to Ukraine in search of the woman who once saved his grandfather from the Nazis. 
That first devastating breakup is fertile territory for a novelist: The misery, irrationality and fits of self-destruction that young exes indulge are all excellent fodder for fiction. But instead of exploring the particulars of these womens pain, Feltman concocts a series of historical and familial tragedies, both big and small, for them to reckon with including a secret adoption, a major natural disaster and the Holocaust. When she tries to return to Willa and Hespers post-breakup suffering, it seems trivial by comparison, the worms in the apple.
Meanwhile, the heroines, who narrate alternating chapters, react with the same agony to both the minor crises (like learning that your ex has a new favorite place to eat caramel walnut cake) and the major ones (like the attempted extermination of an entire population).
We get the sense that Willa has always been hypersensitive: Youre emotionally immune deficient, a friend once told her. When Im around you, everything hurts a little bit extra. But soon Hesper, at first free-spirited and selfish, starts to behave similarly deficient. Their constant mutual torment renders the reader somewhat numb. By the time the corpses of bears and wildcats float through the streets due to a flood at a Tbisili zoo (yes, really), I could barely muster a reaction.
Willa &amp; Hesper does contain some gems of observational writing, particularly when it comes to Hesper and her older sister, Ada, who lovingly scrapes the fleshy inside of Hespers cheek with her fingernail when shes sad, one of those strange sibling rituals that inexplicably confirm youre not alone in the world. The particulars of the sisters relationship when we were kids, shed locked me in the pantry with all the canned goods because the cat liked me better, Hesper remembers and the knotty connection between their divorced but still-involved parents feel more compelling than the relationship between the novels namesakes.",The title characters of Amy Feltman’s “Willa & Hesper” find solace from their breakup in the rabbit holes of their European Jewish backgrounds.,2019-02-22T10:00:11Z,Fiction: Their Romance Dissolved.

"Many conservatives may have been saddened by Friday’s news that the Weekly Standard, a publication that has existed for 23 years, will be ceasing operations this month. But don’t count President Trump among them. In a Twitter message Saturday, Trump blasted the magazine as “pathetic and dishonest,” and slammed its editor-at-large, William Kristol, as a “failed prognosticator.” THE WEEKLY STANDARD ANNOUNCES IT WILL FOLD AFTER 23 YEARS Kristol had written in July : “Donald Trump is in many ways a bad president — bad for the country, bad for conservatism, bad for the Republican party. His sway over party and policy should be limited as much as is feasible and his dominance of our politics not extended any longer than necessary.” “May it rest in peace!” the president wrote of the magazine Kristol co-founded. Kristol appeared concerned that the president's Twitter message wasn't sent to him directly. Parent company Clarity Media’s CEO Ryan McKibben told staffers Friday morning that the magazine would print its final issue Monday. McKibben said the publication “has been hampered by many of the same challenges that countless other magazines and newspapers across the country have been wrestling with,” and ultimately it needed to make the tough decision to close. Others reported that McKibben and associates at Clarity preferred to shutter the Standard rather than sell it, in order to bolster a weekly launched by the Washington Examiner, which, like the Standard, is owned by Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz. Whether any Standard employees would be hired at the new weekly was unclear, the Daily Beast reported.

"To Jeff Bezos, I want to say, Welcome to Queens! I want to tell you more about the neighborhood you and Amazon are moving into. Long Island City is an exhilarating, diverse and rapidly growing community. Much of this growth was the result of a 2001 rezoning in which the city sought to spur commercial development in what had been a manufacturing area. But a boom in commercial development is not what we got. Instead, the zoning changes led to the construction of 10,000 new residential units, vastly more than the 300 projected, according to the Municipal Art Societys latest report. Residential neighborhoods need things that commercial districts do not, and it turns out that if you underestimate the number of new residences by more than 3,200 percent, something has to give. Your arrival may indeed catalyze the central business district envisioned in 2001. But Long Island City is now a primarily residential neighborhood with critical needs that must be addressed. Today, seven out of nine elementary schools in Long Island City are overcrowded; one of them operates at 212 percent of capacity. Ridership at the neighborhoods two subway stations, Court Square and Queensboro Plaza, has increased at seven times the citywide rate. With one-third of an acre of open space for every 1,000 people, Long Island City residents enjoy only one-fifth of the median open space available to New Yorkers. And the Anable Basin, on which Amazons proposed campus sits, is within a federally designated high-risk flood zone. Meanwhile, median household income in Long Island City jumped to $123,000 from $53,000 from 2000 to 2016. The housing that has been built is largely high-end luxury, out of range for the average New Yorker.","Real estate in Long Island City, Queens, where Amazon’s new headquarters could be located.",2018-11-21T08:59:21Z,Will Amazon Ruin or Revitalize New York City?,The New York Times,0
"But Chinese-backed ventures have also hit snags closer to home in Africa. Kenya has now borrowed far more from China than from any other country. But it has also come to depend on a flood of Chinese manufacturing imports, a trade imbalance that makes it harder to raise foreign currency to pay off debt. Kenyas trade with China has grown eightfold in the past decade, according to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who complained at a conference earlier this month in Shanghai that the trade was skewed in favor of China. The I.M.F. has flagged Djibouti, site of a large Chinese military base with live-fire exercises in the desert, as having potential problems with mounting debt, most of which is owed to the Chinese governments Export-Import Bank, according to a report earlier this year from the Center for Global Development. Yet Djibouti shows no signs of limiting new borrowing for projects, and its unclear whether these will earn enough revenue to pay off their debts. In Nigeria, Chinese projects have been dogged by accusations of corruption, poor decision-making, and in some cases shoddy construction. Yet the nation is still turning to China to build a coastal railway and myriad other projects. Chinese debt has become the methamphetamines of infrastructure finance: highly addictive, readily available, and with long-term negative effects that far outweigh any temporary high, according to a recent article by Grant T. Harris, who was President Obamas White House director for Africa from 2011 to 2015. The added fact that China has flooded African markets with low-cost manufactured goods means that many African factories have been driven out of business, making it harder for African countries to raise the hard currency mostly dollars that they need to repay loans from Beijing. China has extended lines of credit to nations rich in natural resources like oil, bauxite, iron and other metals. So even if a resource-rich developing country has trouble repaying its loans for a while, the thinking goes, it can pay with natural resources sooner or later. China also gains politically by extracting promises of support for the Beijing government over Taiwan as a condition of eligibility for a loan. At the China-Africa Forum for Cooperation summit in Beijing this month, China announced that it had set up a $60 billion fund for African infrastructure projects to strengthen ties with the continent.","A crowd in Djibouti, one of the African nations whose debts to China have aroused the anxiety of the Internatational Monetary Fund, with a Chinese flag and a portrait of President Ismail Omar Guellehas at the opening of a housing project in July.",2018-11-23T18:40:22Z,One African Nation Put the Brakes on Chinese Debt.

"The bonds and reminders of family are everywhere. Moving from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, partly so Bianca can pursue vaguely defined career opportunities of her own, she and Adonis spend more time with his mother, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad). When Rocky steps back from training, Adonis reaches out to Duke (Wood Harris), whose father was always in Apollos corner. Rockys estrangement from his own son, Robert, hangs over the movie, part of its weather system of loss and regret. Those are crucial features in the Creed universe. The chance to revisit the geopolitics of Rocky IV in light of current Russo-American relations has been (wisely) passed up in favor of more personal concerns. And from the beginning, the Rocky movies at their best have always embraced the power of defeat. Rocky lost to Apollo in Rocky; Adonis lost to whatshisname in Creed. Losing doesnt make you a better person. It makes you a person. The cruelty and tragedy of the Dragos lies in their denial of this fact. Ivan, after Rocky beat him, suffered a kind of living death, stripped of his dignity and identity by a pitiless system. He has brought up his son in a private version of that world, teaching the younger man that if he doesnt win, hes nobody. And who, meanwhile, is Adonis Creed? Jordan and Caple explore that question through a series of loose, mood-driven passages that highlight Adoniss loneliness and uncertainty as well as his discipline and decency. Though he doesnt quite achieve Cooglers balance of poetic intensity and laid-back naturalism, Caple proves to be both a capable fight choreographer and a deft orchestrator of emotions. The climactic fight arrives on a tide of feelings and ends with a flood of tears. On the way, its the moments of intimacy, pain and humor that make Creed II a solid and satisfying experience. Underneath the boxing epic is a warm, poignant hangout with a young couple and the elders who watch over them. It looks like a popcorn movie, but its Thanksgiving dinner.","Michael B.

"President Trump took aim at Democrats on Saturday while condemning immigration laws in the U.S., doubling down on his threat to close the nation’s southern border.
In a pair of Twitter posts in the afternoon, Trump asserted that “it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws.”
“In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved,” he wrote. “But the Dems don’t care about the crime, they don’t want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!”

He went on to insist that Mexico needed to step in and put a stop to the incoming flow at the border.
“Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out &amp; we will take no more illegals,” Trump tweeted. “Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!”
The president has repeatedly threatened this week to take action at the border and claimed Thursday that Mexico wasn’t doing anything to help prevent “the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country.” He also accused multiple Central American nations of doing “nothing.”

Trump took matters a step further on Friday, tweeting that “If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through[sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.”

"Vice President Mike Pence will visit Nebraska Tuesday to survey the damage caused by historic flooding responsible for killing at least three people. The Midwest is bracing for more flooding as rivers in 40 locations have risen to historic levels.
Flood watches and warnings are in effect in more than a dozen states and more rain is on the way. More than 70 cities in Nebraska have issued emergency declarations over what is the worst flooding the state has seen in at least 50 years.
The total damage is already in the hundreds of millions of dollars and is expected to climb as the flood threat remains. The views from the sky over the flooded Midwest reveal miles and miles of devastation. CBS News' DeMarco Morgan took a plane to Fremont, a town of 26,000 that is nearly isolated by the water. Volunteers with planes are helping fly in supplies.
 ""Fremont's landlocked and you know, they're running out of food … So I was just more than happy to help,"" one volunteer said. 
 While on the ground, a convoy led by the Nebraska National Guard delivered aid along restricted routes. 
 ""I think it's good to see the community come together … bringing supplies in from Omaha and other towns,"" one mother said. ""Everyone's helping out.""
Since Sunday, more than 4,400 people have been evacuated from their homes in at least four states and rising rivers have breached nearly 200 miles of levees. 
The devastation could not come at a worse time for farmers. Chapter 12 bankruptcies were up nearly 20 percent last year among Midwest farms and it's estimated more than $400 million worth of livestock could be impacted by the flooding. 
 ""We just had to a short time to get essentials and dogs and us out the door but the important stuff we got and the rest will have to be replaced,"" Hamburg resident Peg Wilson said
 Many who were able to return to their homes Monday discovered they've lost everything. 
 ""I'm just kind of in a fog, I really don't know what we are going to do but all you can do is pull up your boot straps and start over I guess,"" said flood victim Gerald Simpson.

"Guerneville, Calif. — Torrential rains caused a river in northern California to overflow, leaving the town of Guerneville completely isolated. According to CBS San Francisco, the Russian River in Sonoma County flooded all of the roads leading to the town. 
The river reached 42 feet Wednesday morning, which is considered to be at a major flood stage. By Wednesday night, the river could crest at 46 feet, making it the sixth highest on record. According to the National Weather Service, it won't go below the flood stage until Friday. 
Guerneville ""is officially an island,"" the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. A short time later, an official said the nearby town of Monte Rio was also isolated by floodwaters with all roads leading to it swamped.

KABUL, Afghanistan At least 30 Afghan villagers searching for gold in a riverbed perished on Sunday in a flash flood in northeastern Badakhshan province, provincial officials said.
Along with those killed, dozens were also injured as a landslide and flash flood engulfed the river in the morning in Kohistan district, an area about 68 miles, from Fayzabad, the capital of Badakhshan.
Nek Mohammad Nazari, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said the villagers had dug deep in the river, which had in the past been mined for gold, when they were caught in the flash flood. The casualty numbers could rise, he said.
The victims were villagers who were mining for gold illegally, according to the official. ""Rescue teams have been dispatched to the area to help in recovering the bodies,"" Nazari said.
Sanaullah Rohani, spokesman for the police chief in Badakhshan, said seven of the injured were in critical condition. According to Rohani, there were about 50 people illegally looking for gold at the time of the landslide.
Fawzia Kofi, a lawmaker form Badakhshan, gave a higher death toll for the tragedy, saying that 40 villagers were killed.
Afghanistan is a mountainous, land-locked nation that has huge, largely untouched reserves of copper, iron ore, chromite, mercury, zinc, gems, including rubies and emeralds, as well as gold and silver.
Mines are scattered across different provinces of the country, but still the government has not been able to achieve investments in this important sector or establish a thriving extraction industry.","At least 30 Afghan villagers searching for gold in a riverbed perished on Sunday in a flash flood in northeastern Badakhshan province, officials said.",2019-01-06T16:52:00Z,"Afghanistan flash flood kills at least 30 villagers, officials say",NBC News,0
"Scientists are warning that historic flooding could soon deluge parts of several Southern states along the lower Mississippi River, where floodwaters could persist for several weeks. The flood threat in the South will be discussed Thursday, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration releases its 2019 spring outlook. 
Experts plan a briefing on their flood forecast at the National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Thursday's report is aimed at helping emergency managers and other safety officials to prepare for flooding.
Flooding in Southern states this spring will be ""potentially historic,"" NOAA said in an advisory.
Rapidly melting snow in the upper Midwest is contributing to flooding that will eventually make its way downstream to the Gulf Coast, forecasters have said.
The expected surge of water from the north is unwelcome news in parts of Mississippi. In the western part of that state, the Mississippi River is already swollen and has been flooding some communities unprotected by levees since last month.
One Mississippi region protected by levees is also flooding. That's because smaller rivers can't drain into the Mississippi River as normal because a floodgate that protects the region from even worse flooding by the big river has been closed since Feb. 15.
Around Rolling Fork, Mississippi, townspeople first noticed water rising from swamps near the Mississippi River in late February. The water eventually invaded some homes in that community, about 40 miles north of Vicksburg.
Major flooding is already occurring this week on the Mississippi River near several Southern cities including Arkansas City, Arkansas; Natchez, Mississippi; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to river gauges and data from NOAA.
The specter of major flooding on the Mississippi River upstream from New Orleans is a more perilous situation now than in years past, some researchers believe. That's partly because the river floor has risen significantly higher over the years as sediment has collected in the river bottom, Louisiana State University hydrologist Yi-Jun Xu found.
The situation is so serious that Xu believes a ""mega flood"" could overpower a giant flood control structure north of New Orleans and send the Mississippi River rushing down another path entirely and creating a new route to the Gulf of Mexico. That would allow the Gulf to push saltwater upstream into the river, ruining the drinking water supply for metropolitan New Orleans, according to a summary of Xu's 2017 presentation to the American Geophysical Union.
Last month, a massive storm dropped an ""incredible"" amount of rain in the South, dropping as much as one foot to 1.5 feet of rain in some areas of northern Mississippi, Alabama and into Tennessee.
NOAA's forecast comes as rampaging rivers continue to rise in the upper Midwest, destroying bridges and roads and isolating farming communities. Experts say the cost of the flooding will likely top $1 billion.","The specter of major flooding on the Mississippi River upstream from New Orleans is a more perilous situation now than in years past, some researchers believe",2019-03-21T14:35:51Z,"""Potentially historic"" flooding threatens Southern states",CBS News,1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has decided it cannot authorize new flood insurance policies, citing the partial shutdown of the federal government due to a budget impasse in Congress and potentially putting thousands of home sales in limbo. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees a federal program that insures about 5 million homes and businesses, on Wednesday posted a notice on its website that the program will not be able to “issue new contracts for flood insurance during a lapse in authority unless Congress passes legislation.” 
The National Association of Realtors estimated the decision could disrupt up to 40,000 home sales each month. 
FEMA said that during the shutdown, the government-backed National Flood Insurance Program will continue to pay all claims on policies taken out before midnight on Dec. 21. 
The federal government has been partially shut down since Saturday because of an impasse over President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion in taxpayer funding for a proposed Mexican border wall. Last week Trump said his administration was prepared for a lengthy shutdown.

"(CNN)Two people have died as a result of a severe storm system that caused blizzard conditions in the US Midwest and torrential rain and flood threats in the South. 
And the storm system is not done yet, as it is forecast to bring heavy rain further east on Friday.
Over 11 inches of rain already has fallen across some localized areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, where flash flood emergencies were issued overnight Thursday into Friday morning. Over 50 million people remain under flood and flash flood watches from New Jersey down to Louisiana. 
The snow across the northern Plains and upper Midwest will wind down throughout the Friday morning hours, but blizzard warnings remain through 7 a.m. ET due to wind gusts of up to 55 mph. In addition, blowing snow will limit visibility.
The storm system has been causing major headaches for holiday travelers heading into New Year's weekend. 
""This storm system was always comprised of two threats -- one for blizzard conditions and another for severe weather,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. 
11 inches of rain in parts of the South
Eleven inches of rain have fallen in areas of Washington Parish, Louisiana, and Walthall County, Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana.
NWS Meteorologist Bob Wagner told CNN the weather system has stalled in this one small area for the last five or six hours. 
""There's still rain sitting on the Louisiana Coast that could keep streaming on them for the next 3 to 6 hours,"" Wagner said. He said he's heard reports of some water rescues, but luckily the area is sparsely populated.

Kansas State Highway Patrol reported a weather-related death on Interstate 70 near Oakley. The crash involved a commercial vehicle and a passenger car, Trooper Tod Hileman said. 
About 1 million people were under blizzard warnings Thursday in parts of Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas, CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett said.
""Snow with high winds and low visibility will make travel in this area dangerous if not impossible at times,"" Garrett said. 
The storm system was expected to dump 6 to 12 inches of snow in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas, Norman said. 
In Kansas, blizzard conditions closed a 75-mile stretch on Interstate 70 from Colby to WaKeeney as well as roads from west of Garden City to the Colorado state line. Blizzard conditions over the Northern Great Plains and Upper Midwest are expected to end early Friday morning. 
Roads in parts of central and northern Minnesota are covered with ice and snow. The Minnesota Department of Transportation urged drivers to wait for conditions to improve if travel isn't necessary.

Dugin told Fox News the Russian River is expected to crest by Wednesday night at 46 feet, which would be the highest level in about a quarter-century. While Dugin said the ""worst of the rain"" has tapered off, the river is expected to remain at flood stage until late Thursday night.

The storm system generating the flooding is what's known as an atmospheric river, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says is a huge plume of subtropical moisture.
""Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics,"" NOAA states. ""These columns of vapor move with the weather, carrying an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River.""
The National Weather Service issued flood warnings and flash flood watches for the San Francisco Bay Area and many parts of the Sacramento area, lasting into Thursday morning. The NWS's Bay Area office said that Venado, California in Sonoma County received an ""incredible"" 20.48 inches of rain in 48 hours.

Relentless rain forced the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights in San Francisco, and the city of Santa Rosa received a record 5.66 inches of rain, making it the wettest day on that date since at least 1902.
Several communities also were under evacuation orders in Butte County because of flooded creeks. Other waterways, including the Napa River, also were expected to overflow their banks as an ocean-spanning plume of moisture continued tracking through the West.

"In January 2016, the Women of the Wall appeared to have won a major victory when the Israeli government outlined a new plan to honor progressive Judaism at the Western Wall by creating a prayer space where men and women would be able to pray together.

"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Monday there would never be a foreign military base in his country, following a news report that China was lobbying for a naval base in southwest Koh Kong province. The Asia Times, citing unidentified diplomatic sources and analysts, reported on Thursday that Beijing had been lobbying Cambodia since 2017 for the naval base, which could host frigates, destroyers and other vessels of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. “Does Cambodia need to violate its Constitution to allow a foreign military base on Cambodian territory?” Information Minister Khieu Kanharith quoted Hun Sen as saying on Facebook during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. “With whom does Cambodia need foreign troops to fight with?,” Hun Sen said, according to Khieu Kanharith. “And I do not need foreigners to fight in Cambodian territory like in the past, nor does Cambodia allow her to be a place for ideology or weapon experiment,” he said. The possible naval base is thought to be part of a project by China’s Tianjin Union Development Group (UDG), which began work in 2008 on 45,000 hectares of land in a national park for 99 years. There has been little information about the $3.8 billion project or its progress. UDG was also to spend $45 million on the port, which The Asia Times report described as a naval base. Cambodia-based Sawac Consultants for Development, commissioned by Cambodia’s environment ministry, said the port would be able to handle up to four 20,000-tonne container ships. The port was guarded by Cambodian military and appeared unfinished when Reuters visited in June. China, Hun Sen’s strongest regional ally, has poured billions of dollars in development assistance and loans into Cambodia through bilateral frameworks and China’s Belt and Road initiative. The initiative, unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. It has attracted a flood of Chinese commercial ventures in Cambodia, including casinos and special economic zones.

There's nothing the government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops in Iowa and other flooded states, since the Department of Agriculture has no program that covers the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored-crop losses from the widespread flooding that was triggered by the ""bomb cyclone"" that hit the region in mid-March.
The USDA last year made $12 billion in aid available to farmers who suffered trade-war losses, without needing Congressional approval. The agency has separate programs that partially cover losses from cattle killed in natural disasters, compensate farmers who cannot plant crops due to weather, and help them remove debris left in fields after floods.
But Congress would have to pass legislation to address the harvests lost in the storm, according to Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey and a USDA statement to Reuters.
""It's not traditionally been covered,"" he said. ""But we've not usually had as many losses.""
Indigo Ag, an agriculture technology company, identified 832 on-farm storage bins within flooded Midwest areas. They hold an estimated 5 million to 10 million bushels of corn and soybeans worth between $17.3 million and $34.6 million that could have been damaged in the floods, the company told Reuters.
Across the United States, farmers held soybean stocks of 2.716 billion bushels as of March 1, the largest on record for the time period, the USDA said. Corn stocks were the third-largest on record.
Some Congress members have expressed interest in pursuing legislation to provide aid for damaged crops in storage, Northey said. But passing legislation could require a lengthy political process in the face of an urgent disaster, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, told farmers at a meeting in Malvern, Iowa.
""If we have to pass a bill to do it, I hate to tell you how long that takes,"" said Grassley.
With farm incomes declining for years before the flood, many farmers had planned to sell their grain in storage for money to live, pay their taxes or finance operations, including planting this spring.
Farmers will have to destroy any grains that were contaminated by floodwater, which could also prevent some growers from planting oversaturated fields.
Near Crescent, Iowa, farmer Don Rief said the flood damaged more than 60,000 bushels of his grain, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He tried to move the crops before the flood, but dirt roads were too soft from the storm to support trucks.
""We were just hurrying like hell,"" Rief said. ""Hopefully USDA will come in and minimize some of the damage.""
The USDA does not have a program that covers flood-damaged grain because farmers have typically received more advance notice of rising waters, allowing them to move crops and limit losses, said Tom Vilsack, who ran the agency under former President Barack Obama.
In this case, floods inundated fields quickly after multiple levees failed when rain and melting snow filled the Missouri River and other waterways. The frozen ground was unable to soak up the water.
Near Percival, Iowa, railroad tracks leading up to a grain facility were flooded and broken. A Deere &amp; Co dealership, Wendy's restaurant, Motel 6, and gas station nearby were also underwater, along with homes, cars and farm equipment. Some farmers moved machinery such as tractors on to highways to keep it out of the path of the floods.
About 416,000 acres of cropland across six counties in Iowa were flooded, said Amanda De Jong, state executive director for the USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency.
Of that, about 309,000 acres will be eligible for the federal program that helps farmers and ranchers remove debris left by natural disasters on farmlands, De Jong said last week. She estimated the program would need about $34 million to clean up the fields.
Iowa's agriculture secretary Mike Naig said the government also should help compensate farmers for some of the grain that was damaged.
""This is clearly a gap that we think needs to be addressed,"" said Naig, who accompanied Grassley and Northey in the chopper.
Time is short for a solution, said Carol Vinton, supervisor of Mills County, Iowa, one of the state's two most heavily damaged counties.
Vinton said she was getting calls from farmers whose grain was damaged and are worried about making good on previously signed contracts to deliver those crops to elevators.
The USDA wants to do everything it can to help farmers hurt by the disaster, Northey said.
""They spent all last year raising that crop, putting it in the bin and they maybe already have it marketed,"" he said. ""And now they're going to have to spend time just to get rid of it just to clean the place up.""","There's no government program to help farmers address the millions of bushels of damaged crops in Iowa and other flooded states, a situation worsened by record levels of storage due to the tariff war with China.",2019-04-02T14:54:00Z,Farmers who couldn't sell soybeans due to trade war now find their stockpiles flooded — and uninsured,NBC News,1
"Chris Piecuch, the lead researcher for the Woods Hole study, says sea rise is a particular danger for those in the Mid-Atlantic.
Climate change is warming sea temperatures and raising sea levels everywhere, but folks in places like North Carolina have a double whammy, Piecuch said.
Higher waters pose multiple risks, experts say. Coastal regions can flood at high tide, even on sunny days. And during rainstorms, backed-up drainage systems can inundate inland areas.
If you get a really heavy rain event and the storm sewer is closed off because of the high tide, the rain can't drain, said Molly Mitchell, a marine scientist at the Virginia Institute for Marine Sciences.
The effects are already being felt in cities along the Chesapeake Bay, like Norfolk, where rain will snarl Tidewater Drive, a major north-south roadway, said Baker, the resident who works for the nonprofit Chesapeake Climate Action Network in Norfolk.
But, the problem isnt confined to rainy days. We have sunny day flooding where half of my office is surrounded by floodwater, Baker says.
In Virginia Beach, residents who survived a direct hit from Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 created a Facebook page to pressure officials about repeated flooding in the area. The page has since attracted more than 1,700 followers.
One resident, Conrad Schesventer, who ran an unsuccessful bid for city council last year on a platform of modernizing the drainage system, said floodwaters can rise so quickly that his car has flooded after only a few minutes of heavy rain.
This wasn't related to any tropical system. Its just a heavy thunderstorm, Schesventer said. Stuff like that we didn't use to see.
Melissa Stillmans home in Virginia Beach's Bird Neck neighborhood sits 6 feet above sea level. Homes in her area have drainage ditches that feed rainwater to a nearby creek.
During the rainy summer months, streets around the neighborhood flood up to four times a month, Stillman said. And flood waters are getting closer to her home than ever.
""This is the first year that just during a heavy rainstorm the water was backing up in our yard, getting close to our house,"" Stillman said.
In Pungo, a neighborhood in southern Virginia Beach, locals are wary of winds. Pungo is one of several neighborhoods in the area that suffer from flooding when winds come in from the south, blowing water from the Back Bay into streets and onto properties.
Flooding in Virginia Beach, Virginia on July 24, 2018.Suzee Ferg
Suzee Ferg, who has lived in Pungo for 30 years, said that wind causes floods in the area at least once a month, in addition to weekly rain-related floods.
""I've had water over 3 feet at my back door six times,"" Ferg wrote NBC News via Facebook Messenger. ""Emergency vehicles can not get in. The school bus will not enter the road. If you don't have a lifted truck, you're not getting out.""
Up the eastern seaboard in Atlantic City, flooding has long been a problem. Poverty makes its residents particularly vulnerable, and the city has been slow to recover from the financial crisis of 2008.
Unemployment is nearly twice the statewide average, and 40 percent of the population is below the poverty level. The city's dire finances prompted the state to take over financial operations of the city in 2016.
On Arizona Avenue, a lower-income residential block a half mile from the boardwalk, homeowner Chris Macaluso said he and his neighbors deal with constant flooding.
""It floods during moderate rain,"" Macaluso said. ""Floods during new moons. Floods when there's nor'easters.""
 Rainy day flooding in Atlantic City, New Jersey, is increasingly common. This July 2018 photo is of flooding on Arizona Avenue, four blocks from the boardwalk.Chris Macaluso
In photos and video Macaluso shared with NBC News, residents and cars can be seen wading through tire-high waters. Front steps are submerged and foundations are damaged.
After Hurricane Sandy tore through in 2012, the federal government poured resources into the area. In May, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finished a $38 million, 99,000-ton seawall and boardwalk along the city's northeast coast.
But Macaluso said nothing has been done to protect Arizona Avenue.
""This flooding isn't new. It's been going on for years,"" he said.
Local governments have long been aware of the issue. In Virginia, the state legislature tasked the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences with producing a report on sea levels in 2012, which the institute released the following year.
Since then, Mitchell, the scientist at the institute, said that several cities along the coast have invested in raising roads. Two-hundred miles north, outside of Washington, the city of Alexandria has invested heavily in improving drainage in its Old Town neighborhood, Mitchell said.
Virginia Beach used the institutes projection of 18 inches of rising sea level to help guide its flooding response plan. Deputy City Manager Tom Leahy told NBC News that the city is in the final stages of two studies: one to assess the drainage system and the other to look at how the sea level rise will affect the city.
Farther north in Cape May, New Jersey, the county emergency management department unveiled a real-time flood map in December that lets readers preview expected flooding down to the street level.
Proper planning and investment will be enough to combat the rising seas, Mitchell said, but only if governments and residents act.
Things are going to be different, but that can be OK, Mitchell said. It's only going to be a crisis if we don't change anything.","Sea levels have risen across the entire East Coast, but nowhere as high as in the Mid-Atlantic region.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) Rain in the forecast starting Wednesday could aid crews fighting Californias deadly wildfires while raising the risk of flash floods and complicating efforts to recover remains of those killed. Residents in communities charred by the Los Angeles-area fire stacked sandbags as they prepared for possible downpours that threatened to unleash runoff from hillsides left barren by flames. In Northern California, teams continued sifting through ash and debris as they searched for bodies in and around the decimated town of Paradise. The task is arduous, said Rick Crawford with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. And the possibility exists that some people may never be found. With the death toll at 81 in the states most destructive wildfire, there are still nearly 870 people still unaccounted for. Authorities trying to identify the scores of people killed are using rapid DNA testing that produces results in just two hours. The system can analyze DNA from bone fragments or other remains, then match it to genetic material provided by relatives of the missing. But the technology depends on people coming forward to give a DNA sample via a cheek swab, and so far, there are not nearly as many volunteers as authorities had hoped for. As the search for human remains continues in the burned town of Paradise, fire officials in Northern California say some remains of the missing may never be found. (Nov. 20) As of Tuesday, nearly two weeks after the inferno, only about 60 people had provided samples to pop-up labs, said Annette Mattern, a spokeswoman for ANDE, the Longmont, Colorado, company that is donating the technology. We need hundreds, Mattern said. We need a big enough sample for us to make a positive ID on these and to also give a better idea of how many losses there actually are. The burned area surrounding Paradise, which is about 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) northwest of San Francisco, will see rain starting Wednesday. The precipitation could help knock out the flames, but it could also hinder the search by washing away fragmentary remains and turning ash into a thick paste. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for Paradise and nearby communities and for those areas charred by wildfires earlier this year in Lake, Shasta, Trinity and Mendocino counties. The Camp Fire, which has burned an area about the size of the city of Chicago nearly 238 square miles (616 square kilometers) and destroyed around 13,000 homes, was 75 percent contained on Tuesday. In Southern California, people who worried days earlier that their homes might be consumed by flames were now taking action to guard against possible debris flows caused by the Pacific storm set to come ashore the day before Thanksgiving. Residents filling sandbags at Malibus famous Zuma Beach were mindful of the disaster that struck less than a year ago when a downpour on a fresh burn scar up the coast sent home-smashing debris flows through Montecito, killing 21 people and leaving two missing. The 151-square-mile (391-square-kilometer) Woolsey Fire was almost entirely contained, with 1,500 buildings destroyed and 341 damaged. The major remaining closed area was centered in the rugged Santa Monica Mountains that rise high above the Malibu coast. ___ Associated Press journalists Christopher Weber and John Antczak in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","SACRAMENTO, Calif.

"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Christians quietly celebrated Christmas on Tuesday amid improved security, more than a year after the country declared victory over Islamic State militants who threatened to end their 2,000-year history in Iraq. 
Christianity in Iraq dates back to the first century of the Christian era, when the apostles Thomas and Thaddeus are believed to have preached the Gospel on the fertile flood plains of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. 
Iraq is home to many different eastern rite churches, both Catholic and Orthodox, traditionally a sign of the country’s ethnic and religious diversity. 
But war and sectarian conflict shrank Iraq’s Christian population from 1.5 million to about 400,000 after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Following the onslaught of Islamic State in 2014 and the brutal three-year war that followed their numbers have fallen further, though it is not known exactly by how much. 
In Baghdad, Christians celebrated mass on Tuesday morning declared a national holiday by government in churches decorated for Christmas. Once fearful, they said they were now hopeful, since conditions had improved. 
“Of course we can say the security situation is better than in previous years,” said Father Basilius, leader of the St George Chaldean Church in Baghdad where more than a hundred congregants attended Christmas mass. 
“We enjoy security and stability mainly in Baghdad. In addition, Daesh was beaten,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. 
Iraq declared victory over the militants more than a year ago, but the damage done to Christian enclaves on the Nineveh Plains has been extensive. 
In Qaraqosh, a town also known as Hamdaniya which lies 15 km (10 miles) west of Mosul, the damage is still visible. 
At the city’s Immaculate Church, which belongs to the Syrian Catholic denomination and has not yet been rebuilt since the militants set it on fire in 2014, Christians gathered for midnight mass on Monday, surrounded by blackened walls still tagged with Islamic State graffiti. 
Dozens of worshippers prayed and received communion, and then gathered around the traditional bonfire in the church’s courtyard. 
Before the militant onslaught, Qaraqosh was the largest Christian settlement in Iraq, with a population of more than 50,000. But today only a few hundred families have returned. 
Faced with a choice to convert, pay a tax or die, many Christians in the Nineveh Plains fled to nearby towns and cities and some eventually moved abroad. 
Some have since returned, Father Butros said, adding: “We hope that all displaced families will return.”

"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Armed police patrolled the streets and manned checkpoints; shops and restaurants stayed shuttered, and residents laid tributes as Strasbourg recoiled on Wednesday from the deadly shooting at a Christmas market. Blood stains spattered the Rue Des Grandes Arcades, a shopping street where some of the victims were shot. In Place Kleber, at the center of the French city, well-wishers left flowers at the foot of a Christmas tree, in memory of the two people killed. “It’s destroyed the Christmas market. Nobody will want to come here,” said Bui, a 46-year-old waiter at the Casa Toscana restaurant. “We thought it was firecrackers or a joke to begin with, what with the yellow vest protests at the moment,” he said, referring to nationwide demonstrations against high living costs. “It took about five minutes for people to realize what was going on.” The attack risks dealing a devastating blow to the city’s retail and tourism industries, just as the month-long yellow vest unrest may have blunted the French economy. The Saint Sepulcre restaurant, close to where the first shots were fired, was closed by manager Claude Fricker on Wednesday as two of her chefs who helped the wounded recovered from the trauma. “We know that we’re not safe anywhere despite all the security measures,” said a local pensioner who gave his name as Ralph. “It’s impossible to counter the actions of a madman, we should not give into panic or to paranoia.” First signs, though, were that visitors felt differently. At the Hotel Kleber on the main square, staff handled a flood of cancellations ahead of what should be one of the busiest shopping weekends before Christmas. “We’re getting a lot of calls and emails for cancellations. It’s going to hit us hard, said receptionist Elena Bonal. Mayor Roland Ries told reporters the city would not be cowed by what he said was indisputably an act of terror. “Life must resume tomorrow. The Christmas market will reopen tomorrow and we will restart our lives on the basis of our values. We won’t let the act of a madman knock us down.” Editing by Richard Lough and Robin Pomeroy","Armed police patrolled the streets and manned checkpoints; shops and restaurants stayed shuttered, and residents laid tributes as Strasbourg recoiled on Wednesday from the deadly shooting at a Christmas market.",2018-12-12T13:42:22Z,'We thought it was a joke': Strasbourg stunned by attack,Reuters,0

"BERLIN (Reuters) - The new leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, bungled her welcome to party members meeting to discuss immigration policy by calling them “Social Democrats” - the name of their coalition partners. 
Kramp-Karrenbauer took over from Chancellor Angela Merkel as leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in December, campaigning on a centrist platform that put her closer to the Social Democrats than to the right-wing rivals she defeated. 
Opening the immigration policy meeting on Sunday, Kramp-Karrenbauer said she was pleased to be joined by members of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) - only she confused her own party with the Social Democrats. 
“I am particularly pleased that we are not only doing this here as Social Democrats tonight, but that we are doing this together with friends from the CSU,” she said to embarrassed laughter from CDU members, including cabinet ministers. 
She immediately corrected herself and tried to explain her slip as “something to do with the Social Democrats dealing with a big trauma in their party” over reform of the Hartz IV labor market reforms they introduced from 2005. 
German media jumped on the slip-up - the tabloid Bild called it an “embarrassing mishap” - and the SPD poked fun at Kramp-Karrenbauer, dubbed AKK after her initials, by advising her on the Social Democrats’ standard greeting to each other. 
“Dear @akk,” tweeted SPD Secretary General Lars Klingbeil. “Small tip for the future: It is ‘Dear comrades!’ Greetings in solidarity.” 
The conservative alliance of CDU and CSU only teamed up with the SPD to renew their “grand coalition” last year after their talks with two smaller parties on forming an alliance collapsed. 
Kramp-Karrenbauer’s election as CDU leader put her in pole position to become Germany’s next chancellor and she is trying to put her own stamp on the party. Merkel has said she will not seek re-election after this parliamentary term, ending in 2021. 
The CDU meets again on Monday to discuss how to avoid a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis that saw more than 1 million asylum seekers flood into Germany after Merkel decided to leave open the country’s borders. They are meeting without Merkel.

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, held on Tuesday the first public trial run of its $3 billion mass rapid transit (MRT) system aimed at improving transport conditions in a city suffering some of the worst traffic jams in the world. 
The MRT, which is officially due to open on March 26, was developed with Japanese expertise and funding, and is a centre-piece of an infrastructure boom under President Joko Widodo, who is seeking re-election in April. 
Dozens of excited residents, many of them students, rode in the shiny, air-conditioned carriages, tested the ticketing machines, and wandered through the stations. 
“I’m impressed that it’s like any foreign country, like Singapore!” said Mika, a 23-year-old student, who registered weeks ago for the trial run. 
But some passengers complained that facilities in some stations and feeder lines had not been finished. 
“Some of the supporting infrastructure ... for pedestrians and passengers is very incomplete,” said Irfan, 40, who had brought his son along for the subway ride. 
Construction workers in hard hats were racing to finish up walkways and other facilities in some stations. 
The first phase is a 16-km stretch that runs partially underground from south to central Jakarta along one of the city’s main thoroughfares. The train takes about 30 minutes, compared with more than an hour by car in regular traffic. 
Construction of the second line - an 8-km stretch that ends in north Jakarta - is underway and it should be operational by 2025. 
Ticket prices have been set at an initial 10,000 rupiah (70 cents) and the trains can carry more than 28,000 passengers a day. 
Delayed for more than 20 years, the project was finally launched in 2013, with the first line originally scheduled to open in 2018. 
As well as it awful traffic jams, Jakarta regularly suffers from floods and earthquakes and the MRT was built to withstand such disasters, said Silvia Halim, construction director of PT MRT, the Indonesian-Japanese consortium that is developing the network.  
“We have used the reference of standards from Japan,” Halim said. “The structure of the tunnel and the viaduct can hold up against a magnitude of 8 or equivalent.” 
Flood barriers have been installed to protect the underground stations from inundation, she said.

Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz put fighting graft high among his government’s tasks after King Abdullah appointed him in June to defuse a crisis that saw some of the largest protests in years over unpopular IMF-guided economic policies and tax hikes. 
The prosecution said chief suspect Owni Mutee and his 28 other accomplices had evaded paying 539 million dinars ($760 million) by bribing officials to dodge customs and taxes from a counterfeit cigarettes and tobacco production business. 
Among the charges facing all the defendants are “acts that endanger security of the society” and “endangering the economic resources of the country” under tough anti-terrorism laws. 
They could face at least 15 years in prison, judicial sources say. 
The defendants plead not guilty. 
The prosecution said Mutee invested in multi million dollar factories inside the country’s duty free zone and bribed officials to smuggle in and flood the local market with cheaper counterfeit cigarettes under top international brands. 
State revenues from 70 percent taxes on cigarettes top $1.7 billion annually, according to industry experts. 
The case is the largest since a major financial scam in 2008 exposed widespread embezzlement under a draconian “economic crimes” law. 
Some Jordanians regard the trial with scepticism, saying it will fail to mollify anger over perceived rampant corruption among senior officials in a country whose economy has also been hit by regional conflict. 
The government has failed to extradite Walid Kurdi, a businessman with connections to the royal palace, who as chairman of a phosphate firm was convicted in 2013 of embezzlement of millions of dollars and has since fled the country. 
Activists and opposition figures say top officials should be put on trial for a loss of public funds that they say has worsened Jordan’s economic woes and record $40 billion in public debt. 
Defense lawyers accused the government of overblowing the case to win popularity amid weekly protests against government policies blamed for rising poverty and growing unemployment among youths. 
“They want to win popularity after the summer protests,” said Hussam Abu Ruman, a lawyer for Mutee.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban still needs to do more to avoid the expulsion of his anti-immigration Fidesz party from the main European conservative group, its leader was quoted on Friday as saying. 
Thirteen conservative parties have demanded Fidesz be expelled from the European People’s Party (EPP) over an anti-immigration and anti-EU campaign that attacked European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a fellow EPP member, and U.S. philanthropist George Soros. 
Orban, a strident nationalist, has written letters of apology to EPP politicians but Manfred Weber, the German who leads the grouping in the European Parliament, said the Hungarian prime minister had to do more. 
“If Viktor Orban doesn’t manage to create trust in coming days among the EPP parties and his critics, then things will be difficult,” Weber told Der Spiegel, according to extracts of an interview published on Friday. 
Tearing down the posters “is a start, but no more”, he said, referring to Orban’s move to take down posters that suggest Juncker and Soros are conspiring to flood Europe with illegal immigrants from Muslim countries. 
The EPP, made up of the main center-right parties from across Europe, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, is the largest grouping in the European Parliament. 
With the EPP preparing now for EU elections in May, Weber - accused by some of having been too conciliatory toward Orban and Fidesz - hopes to replace Juncker later this year as president of the Commission, the EU executive. 
The EPP gains from an electorally successful central European party like Fidesz in its ranks, while Orban benefits from having a large group in the European Parliament to shield him from censure there. 
However, his anti-immigrant and anti-EU rhetoric has infuriated many moderate conservatives around Europe. The EPP will hold a secret ballot next Wednesday to decide whether to expel Fidesz from the grouping. 
The EU has long criticized Fidesz over policies it says threaten the rule of law by imposing party control over the judiciary, media and other institutions. Fidesz rejects this. 
Some European politicians also condemn Orban’s attacks on Soros, who is Jewish, as anti-Semitic, which Fidesz also rejects.

"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary’s pro-government media continued to publish anti-EU messages on Wednesday despite a promise by a government official to halt the campaign during talks with a center-right European grouping on Tuesday. 
Government billboards against an EU chief and the U.S.-Hungarian billionaire George Soros were among the grievances of members of the European People’s Party (EPP) which are seeking to expel Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party. 
A dozen of about 80 members of the EPP, the largest grouping in the European Parliament, felt Hungary had violated its values so badly that it should be kicked out, even if that weakens the group just before Europe-wide elections. 
The European Commission, which is also in dispute with Hungary over what is says are challenges to the rule of law, has dismissed the attack campaign, which suggests that it seeks to flood Hungary with immigrants, as fiction. 
Crunch talks on Tuesday between Orban and EPP group leader Manfred Weber failed to resolve their differences, meaning expulsion is still possible. 
Weber has demanded an immediate and permanent end to Orban’s anti-EU and anti-immigrant campaigning - as well as an apology to EPP members for his rhetoric and renewed support for a university in Hungary. [L8N20Z5F4] 
Orban’s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas, who is also a Fidesz vice chairman, said on Tuesday: “The hoarding campaign has finished; from now on members of the public will see hoardings promoting the government’s family protection action plan.” 
But full-page adverts were in several pro-government dailies and continued on state television on Wednesday. 
The adverts, which depict a smiling head of Soros behind a grinning EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, an EPP member, say “you have a right to know what Brussels is planning” - the same as the billboards that sprung up across the country. 
The ads go on to list purported EU moves to ease immigration, such as easier visa access or cash payments to immigrants. The commission says they are a “conspiracy theory”. 
A government spokesman said Hungary only undertook to end the campaign by March 15. 
The EPP is the largest party in the European Parliament, and is expected to remain the strongest despite its eroding support and gains by populist parties, polls have shown.

"(CNN)Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is visiting the flood-stricken northern state of Queensland Tuesday, where supermarkets are sending in supplies by barge amid fears of food shortages. 
According to CNN affiliate 9 News, supermarket shelves across the region are nearly empty, with chains struggling to restock after Townsville Airport was closed and many major roads cut. Grocery store chain Woolworths said it was sending in food supplies by barge, while supermarket chain Coles was flying stocks into Cairns and trucking them to Townsville. 
Meanwhile, the rains show no signs of stopping, as Morrison and other senior government officials toured the area and met with those displaced by the floods. 
""It was frankly quite overwhelming, people are in shock,"" Morrison said after visiting Townsville. ""The real work is to make sure they can get through the clean up and resume their lives."" 
The government has said it will provide disaster relief for those affected by the floods, and encouraged people to apply for emergency assistant payments. 
Major flood warnings remain in place for much of the coastal city of Townsville and surrounding areas, where 20,000 homes are believed to be at risk. Hundreds of people have already taken refuge in evacuation centers set up to house those who had to flee their homes, according to CNN affiliate 9 News. 
9 News reported Monday that entire suburbs of Townsville were completely submerged. Local resident Gresham Ross told 9 News that the floodwaters are the highest he's seen in 30 years of living in the area.
""You just can't believe how much water has come down from the Ross River,"" he said.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has warned the bill for damages could reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
To make matters worse for the terrified residents fleeing their homes, there have been numerous sightings of crocodiles and snakes being swept along with the floodwaters, 9 News reported.
Mundingburra resident Erin Hahn told the broadcaster she spotted a freshwater crocodile in front of her father's house Sunday night.
""(It) was nearly a meter or two long (3.3 to 6.6 feet),"" she said.
As of Tuesday morning, the weather shows no signs of letting up across Queensland.
""We've continued to see intense and significant rainfall through northern parts of Queensland -- around the coastal areas just northwest of Townsville, where we saw over 300 mm (11.8 inches) to 9 a.m. this morning,"" said Queensland Bureau of Meteorology expert Grace Legge, warning that ""Townsville could still see some significant rainfall"" as well as heavy wind in the days to come, which could spark further flash flooding. 
Intense rain on Sunday forced authorities to open the floodgates to relieve pressure and prevent a collapse, releasing around 1,900 cubic meters of water per second downriver. The dam was holding 224% of its capacity Monday afternoon, according to 9 News, after peaking Sunday night at 247%.
Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill said overnight rain had thankfully missed the catchment of the dam, which remains swollen with water. 
""Everyone held their breath hopeful that that rainfall wouldn't fall into the Ross River catchment. It didn't,"" she told 9 News. ""We are not out of the woods yet. If we were to receive high rainfall again in the catchment, the situation could change very quickly.""
According to CNN affiliate 7 News, two men are feared missing near Townsville, amid fears they were swept away by the flood waters. Police have joined friends and family in searching for Hughie Morton, 21, and Troy Mathieson, 23, after they were last seen on Ross River Road on Monday morning.

"BEIRA, Mozambique Ceaseless rain and widespread devastation hampered rescue operations Thursday as underequipped aid agencies struggled to cope with the extensive damage inflicted by Cyclone Idai on central Mozambique. 
Satellite images from the European Space Agency still show a vast inland sea of more than 1,000 square miles stretching away from the port town of Beira, where the cyclone landed Friday. The storm shattered this town of a half-million people, who already suffered from poor infrastructure.
Its quite tragic what were seeing, said Hugo Du Plessis, an aviation operations official for the World Food Program. My pilots are telling me that people are still up in trees, but so are snakes. Imagine, having to choose between a snake and drowning.
While the waters are slowly receding, they are waist-level in many areas, and tens of thousands of people are still stranded, with aid agencies estimating that 400,000 people have lost their homes and will need to be housed in emergency shelters.
Minister of Land and Environment Celso Correia told journalists Thursday that the death toll in Mozambique was 217, while 15,000 people still needed to be rescued. So far, 3,000 have been saved. An additional 139 are believed to have died in neighboring Zimbabwe and 56 in Malawi.
Our biggest fight is against the clock, Correia told a news conference, adding that rescuers were working 24 hours per day. The situation is still critical.
There are fears that the toll could soar into the thousands once some of the more remote affected areas are reached.
[In photos: Cyclone Idai lays waste to parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi]
The plan is ultimately to create vast camps to house the displaced, but for now the immediate goal, six days after the cyclone hit, is still just to rescue people and feed them.
The grand plan is to set up two mega camps, said Gerald Bourke, a spokesman for WFP. The question is how to get people there. Theres talk of using a combination of boats and helicopters.
For now the aid agencies and local authorities struggling to help people are woefully underequipped, with just two U.N. helicopters that arrived from Uganda and South Africa and one cargo aircraft. There is also an urgent need for flat-bottomed boats to venture out into the flooded areas to find people.
Choppy seas and washed-out roads have made getting the necessary equipment to Beira difficult.
Most of the rescues have been carried out by the overburdened helicopters that can take up to 30 people at a time.
On a flight operated by Mission Air Fellowship delivering tents and sanitation kits to Beira on behalf of Save the Children, the extent of the damage came into stark relief.
Vast stretches of farmland were inundated. The regions mango trees, apparently weaker than its palms, were uprooted as if a comb had run through them, plucking them out of the ground. Roads gave way to gushing, muddy water and the debris of thousands of tin roofs was everywhere.
One of the saddest sights were the endless flattened corn fields, ruined right on the verge of their harvest. The annihilation of the crop by the floods ensures a prolonged humanitarian crises here.
Dave Holmes, the flights pilot, once surveyed floods for the U.S. Geological Service, including the epic ones that followed Hurricane Floyd in North Carolina in 1999.
That was nothing compared to this, he said, banking his Cessna left. Flying over this is intimidating. This feels like flying out into the sea.
While the port of Beira itself has reopened, allowing in much-needed supplies such as fuel, signs of the damage to the city are everywhere. Metal sheeting from roofs lies in piles, and trees have been robbed of their leaves and branches. There is also no power or running water. The aid agency Oxfam said 90 percent of the city was underwater.
Food prices are skyrocketing, Rotafina Donco, Oxfam country director for Mozambique, said in a statement. Some people in transit camps have not eaten for days, she added.

"(CNN) Flash flood watches and evacuation orders were issued Wednesday for parts of California scorched by recent wildfires, as possible thunderstorms threatened to increase the risk of mudslides and debris flows in those areas. In Southern California, Cal Fire of Riverside County issued mandatory evacuation orders for some communities affected by the Holy Fire, which burned more than 22,000 acres earlier this year. This order was initially a voluntary one, but was changed to a mandatory order because of the projected amount of rainfall, officials said. Orange County Fire Authority announced a flash flood watch and ordered voluntary evacuations for homes located in Trabuco Creek, Rose Canyon, and in the Mystic Oaks/El Cariso areas, which were also scorched by the Holy Fire. Orange County fire stations were offering residents sand and sandbags. The National Weather Service Sacramento also issued a flash flood watch for burned parts of Northern California, including areas where the state's deadliest and most destructive wildfire, the Camp Fire, raged for more than two weeks this month, killing 88 people. A flash flood watch was also in effect through Thursday morning for communities scorched by the Mendocino Complex and Carr fires, which each burned hundreds of thousands of acres ""Ash, mud, and debris flows will be possible with heavy rain,"" the weather service posted on Twitter. Up to 2 inches of rain is expected throughout Northern California over the next 24 hours, said CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward. Up to three inches of rain are possible in some areas, according to Taylor.

"There is no vow that defined Mr. Trumps campaign more than his promise to build a border wall. If he is going to enter the campaign in the embarrassing position of not having fulfilled that pledge, at the very minimum hes going to have to show that he exhausted every option at his disposal and fought for the wall tooth and nail. A high-profile government shutdown battle is a way to accomplish that.
Most likely, perhaps at some point after House Democrats take control, Mr. Trump will be forced to sign a bill without wall funding, as he will no longer have the votes for it in the House. Coming off a huge electoral victory, Democrats arent about to surrender and give Mr. Trump what would be the biggest victory of his presidency.
On Friday, the president was already setting the stage to deflect blame for any eventual capitulation hell have to make. He urged the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to use the nuclear option to allow Republicans to overcome a Democratic filibuster and pass legislation with a simple majority. This wont happen, as Mr. McConnell has opposed such a course, and even if he wanted to pursue it, it isnt even clear that there is a simple majority that would support it. But it signals where Mr. Trump is heading. Hell eventually suck up the border wall loss and blame intransigent Democrats for not caring about border security as well asweak-kneed Senate Republicans who refused to pull the nuclear trigger.
Mr. Trump will spend the remainder of his first term trying to make up for the loss by appealing to his base in other ways. For example, he will confirm a flood of conservative federal judges, a job that will become easier in January thanks to Republican gains in the Senate. Additionally, with the 2020 Democratic field wide open, theres a chance that Mr. Trumps opponent will also be a polarizing figure like Hillary Clinton in 2016  setting the stage for a base vs. base election that he would relish.
Its quite possible that his strategy of feeding the base will doom his chances of re-election, but at this point its the best play he has.

"(CNN)Planes fly over this stretch of Ethiopia's Oromia region every day. Rising up to cruising altitude, the passengers half listen to the announcements in Amharic -- the official language of Ethiopia -- and English.
It takes just a few minutes for a Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane taking off from Bole international airport in Addis Ababa to pass over the rolling teff and corn fields near Bishoftu.
The shepherds and farmers here don't really pay the planes much attention.
That is, until Ethopian Airlines ET 302 came crashing down from the sky, killing all 157 people on board.
The car journey toward the crash site from the capital shifts from a three-lane highway to a winding dirt and rock track past farming homesteads and villages. Passing a donkey cart, the driver points toward a hill covered with Eucalyptus trees. 
There, in the distance, a crowd of people stand on the hillside, watching the movement of heavy machinery work through the debris.
The new Boeing 737 MAX 8 slammed into this hillside with such ferocity that at first, it seems to have all but vanished. Small shredded sections of riveted green fuselage lie scattered in a debris field.
But the industrial diggers do their work, inexorably, reclaiming twister silver engine parts, a shredded tire, electronics -- dumping them in a small pile next to the crater.  
Ethiopian Red Cross officials gingerly pick through the rubble in their red jackets, face masks, and surgical gloves -- some carrying white plastic zip-up bags. They're mostly silent as they work.
Those on the flight came from across the world, many were drawn to East Africa as aid workers. Others were on business, or flying home to surprise their families with a visit.
Their papers and plans swirl into the air in gusts of hot wind -- blowing beyond the boundaries of the crash site, marked with yellow police tape.
Tadu Gerechu was tending his sheep when he heard the roar of the plane overhead. He said it seemed in trouble, with flashes of flames coming out of its back. 
""There was a huge explosion and smoke,"" he says, ""we ran to the scene -- about 20 of us -- but there was nothing we could do for these people.""
Local government militia with AK-47s and the federal police stand guard outside the perimeter, while forensic experts suit up in white hazmat suits.
""When you find anything potentially important, raise your hand and the whole line will stop,"" says the South African lead expert dispatched to accidents across the continent.
A long line of men move shoulder to shoulder across the debris field. Bent over, they stop every few inches, running their fingers through the earth dotted with small parts of plane wreckage.
A small group of Chinese businessmen and embassy officials come to the site to quietly pay their respects.
They bow their heads and place a bowl of fruit, some bread and incense next to the perimeter tape.  
Busses drive families of victims down the long route from the Ethiopian capital to the crash site.
Feisal Hussein had traveled with his uncle to the crash site from Embu, a small town near Mount Kenya to try and find his father, Hussein Swaleh. Swaleh was well known in Kenya as he once headed the Kenyan Football Federation.
""All along we had thoughts running through our mind that it could be true or it could not be true,"" says Hussein. 
""People are still crying back home and they will not cease until the burial is done,"" he says, ""because what we feel as a family is that our kin, our beloved dad, deserves a befitting send-off.""
White plastic now covers the plane sections. An archway of white roses and bouquets have been placed just outside the yellow tape.
Families light candles and pray. They look around the hillside, taking in the place where their loved ones were lost. Some stand on the edge of the crater. In deference, the giant diggers are still. 
Local villagers who have been coming to the site for days stand respectively at a distance, the older women wear cotton shawls.

"(Reuters) - Two former South Carolina sheriff’s deputies were charged with involuntary manslaughter on Friday for the deaths of two women who drowned while being transported through floodwaters resulting from September’s Hurricane Florence, court officials said. 
The deputies were driving two female mental health patients on Sept. 18 when they passed a barrier warning of rising waters, according to The State newspaper. Floodwaters pinned their van against a guard rail, the newspaper said. The officers managed to escape their vehicle when it began to flood but were unable to rescue the patients, the newspaper said. 
Stephen Flood and Joshua Bishop were each charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter and Flood was also charged with two counts of reckless homicide, according to a spokeswoman for the Marion County Clerk of Courts. 
Hurricane Florence, which caused billions of dollars in damage, made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 storm last September and brought devastating floods to states in the region, resulting in at least 51 deaths. 
A day after the deputies abandoned the patients, police discovered the bodies of Wendy Newton, a 45-year-old woman from Shallotte, North Carolina, and Nicolette Green, a 43-year-old woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, police said. Officials recovered the van days later. 
Flood and Bishop were fired from the sheriff’s office in October, according to police officials. 
The men were due back in court at the Marion County Courthouse on Feb. 26. 
Local prosecutors and police declined to answer specific questions on how the deaths occurred. 
Lawyers for Bishop and Flood could not immediately be reached.

On Jan. 15, 1919, at around 12:30 p.m., Boston Police patrolman Frank McManus was at a call box reporting back to headquarters when he heard a loud scraping and grinding noise. Pausing to figure out the source, he suddenly found himself overcome with shock.
McManus managed to make out to the dispatcher: Send all available rescue vehicles and personnel immediately theres a wave of molasses coming down Commercial Street,"" according to Stephen Puleo, historian and author of Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919.
The wave was 2.3 million gallons, moving at 35 miles per hour, 25 feet high and 160 feet wide at its outset, rushing through the city's crowded and densely populated North End.
A massive, 50-foot-high steel tank holding the molasses had ruptured. People in its direct path were immediately swallowed, drowned and asphyxiated by the notoriously viscous substance.
Within seconds, two city blocks were flooded. Puleo told NBC News that the tide of molasses ripped the Engine 31 Firehouse from its foundation, almost sweeping the building into the Boston Harbor. The brown wave busted windows, overturned railcars and flooded homes. By sunset, 21 people were dead, 150 were injured and the North End looked like it had been bombed.

THE STICKY TSUNAMI
If you're familiar with the phrase slow as molasses, its hard to make sense of the 1919 flood. Dr. Nicole Sharp, a science communicator and an expert in fluid dynamics, said that when she heard the 35-mph number, she was surprised. One of my first questions was, is that number plausible? she said.
Sharp decided to look into the science behind the flood, along with a team of scientists at Harvard. I found that the initial wave could have moved at that speed, she said.
Sharp said the flood could be broken down into two stages, with the first called The Tsunami.
Molasses is 1.5 times heavier than water. Its very dense, Sharp said. The tank, piled so high with molasses, stored a large amount of potential energy. When the tank ruptured, all that potential energy became kinetic energy. The fact that the molasses is extremely viscous doesn't matter for the first 60-90 seconds. The inertia is so much more powerful than the forces that can be moved by the viscosity.
When the tank broke and the molasses exploded, there was no outrunning it. When the initial wave came through, it just pulverized everything, Sharp said. Peoples bones were crushed, their bodies thrown onto buildings and train cars. Many survivors had broken backs and fractured skulls.
During the second stage of the flood, the inertia runs out as the molasses spreads thats when viscosity starts to matter,"" Sharp said, referring to a liquid's resistance to flow. As molasses flooded the streets, it slowed but became thicker and stickier, and still difficult to escape. People were trapped, with witnesses described trying to breathe while stuck, gasping for their lives and simultaneously trying to avoid inhaling too much.
Cold weather made things worse. As the temperature dropped, the molasses got harder and harder to move, which is a problem when youre trying to shift rubble,"" Sharp said.
It was also a problem for rescuers who were trying to lift people out of the molasses. Firefighters had to spread ladders over it to prevent themselves from falling into sticky vats that were once streets.

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
A U.S. Industrial Alcohol (USIA) subsidiary, Purity Distilling Co., built the tank in 1915 to keep up with increasing demand for military weapons. The tank stored molasses from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the West Indies, which was then brought to a distillery in East Cambridge and turned into industrial alcohol. Companies in the U.S., England, and France bought the alcohol, which they desperately needed to make dynamite, smokeless powder and other explosives used in World War I.
Puleo explains in his book that the project was rushed from the beginning. He told NBC News that the manager of the project, Arthur Jell, USIAs treasurer, had no technical experience, no architectural experience, no engineering experience.
From the beginning, Jell sidestepped safety precautions. Instead of filling the entire tank with water after it was finished to test for leaks, he only put in six inches of water. The tank starts leaking on Day 1, Puleo said.
Ronald Mayville, a senior principal at the engineering firm Simpson Gumpertz &amp; Heger in Massachusetts, has studied the molasses flood in his spare time. Mayville analyzed the flood using todays engineering tools and suspects the tank might have been designed for water instead of molasses. The stress in the tank is directly linked to the fluid inside, he said. It should have been very straightforward."" Building the tank, Mayville explained, is ""a relatively simple calculation that most engineers could do in that day.
Even though workers alerted USIA to the leaks, the company remained unperturbed. Profits from the war were pouring in as steadily as molasses was leaking out of the tank. In 1918, in an effort to shield the leaks and avoid costly fixes, Jell even had the steel-colored tank painted brown, to camouflage the oozing molasses.
Puleo said that seven days before the flood, on a day with a low of 2 degrees Fahrenheit, a new shipment dumped more than half a million gallons of molasses into the poorly built tank.
As warm molasses from the ship mixed with cold molasses in the tank, it triggered a fermentation process that produced gas. People reported hearing the tank whining and groaning. A week later, with the almost-full tank weighing 26 million pounds and the gas inside putting extra pressure on the steel walls, it ruptured.

THE FLOODS LEGACY
Though the flood has been long forgotten in popular memory, its legacy remains. Puleo told NBC News that the tank didnt even require a permit because it was considered a receptacle, not a building,"" adding, ""Every building construction standard that we sort of take for granted today comes about because of the Molasses Flood.
In his book, Puleo writes, Shortly after the flood, the Boston Building Department began requiring that all calculations of engineers and architects be filed with their plans and that stamped drawings be signed. This later became standard practice across the country.
Sharp has a more abstract take. She hopes the flood taught people to have some respect for the destructive power of things we usually think of as harmless.
USIA did not rebuild the tank, and new war technology made the mass distillation of molasses for industrial alcohol obsolete. Much of the area flooded by molasses is now in Langone Park, where a small plaque hangs to commemorate the tragedy.

"William Barr, President Trump's nominee for attorney general, disclosed on Monday that he has discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe with Vice President Mike Pence, although he insisted he neither provided legal advice to the White House nor received any confidential information from Pence.
Barr also defended the unsolicited memorandum he sent to the Justice Department last year that was criticial of the Russia probe, explaining that it was narrow in scope and based on potentially incomplete information.
The revelations were contained in Barr's written responses to questions from senators considering his nomination to permanently fill the role currently held by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has served since November following the resignation of Jeff Sessions.
""The Vice President and I are acquainted, and since the spring of 2017, we have had occasional conversations (sometimes joined by his chief of staff) on a variety of subjects, including policy, personnel, and other issues,"" Barr wrote. ""Our conversations have included, at times, general discussion of the Special Counsel’s investigation in which I gave my views on such matters as Bob Mueller’s high integrity and various media reports. In these conversations, I did not provide legal advice, nor, to the best of my recollection, did he provide confidential information.""
Barr added that he did not substantively discuss the Mueller probe in his conversations with Pence, Trump, or other White House officials as his nomination was under consideration.
BARR'S 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON WROTE PHOTOGRAPHED NOTES ON HEARING, RUSSIA PROBE
He said Trump summoned him to the White House in early December, following the state funeral of former President George H.W. Bush.
""On December 5, 2018, following President Bush’s funeral, President Trump asked me to stop by the White House,"" Barr wrote. ""We spoke about a variety of issues, and were joined for much of the discussion by then-White House Counsel Emmet Flood and Vice President Pence. We have also spoken via phone several times as part of the selection and nomination process for the Attorney General position.""
He continued: ""In all of these conversations, there was no discussion of the substance of the Special Counsel’s investigation. The President has not asked me my views about any aspect of the investigation, and he has not asked me about what I would do about anything in the investigation.""
Barr's Senate confirmation hearings ended earlier this month with few fireworks, and Barr appeared likely to sail to confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate. Even so, some Democrats sounded the alarm, with Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal charging that Barr had indicated he would exploit legal ""loopholes"" to hide Mueller's final report from the public and to resist subpoenas against the White House.
ANALYSIS: BARR MIGHT EVEN PICK UP DEMOCRATIC VOTES AFTER HEARING PERFORMANCE
""I will commit to providing as much information as I can, consistent with the regulations,"" Barr had told Blumenthal when asked if he would ensure that Mueller's full report was publicly released.
South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has said he was satisfied that Barr was the ""right man for the job."" He added that Democrats had asked appropriate questions -- in stark contrast to what he called the ""sham"" that unfolded during the confirmation hearings of now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

During the hearing, Barr's past comments about the Mueller investigation attracted scrutiny, including an unsolicited memo he sent the Justice Department last year criticizing the special counsel's inquiry into whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice.
In the memo, Barr wrote, among other comments, that “Mueller should not be permitted to demand that the President submit to interrogation about alleged obstruction.”
In his written responses Monday, Barr addressed the memo, and noted that Trump ""did not ask me my views about any aspect of the investigation, and he did not ask me about what I would do about anything in the investigation.""
Barr said the memo was based on hypothetical and incomplete information and did not necessary represent his final views on the Mueller probe or the legality of various tools it could employ.
""My memorandum was narrow in scope,"" Barr wrote in response to a question from Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin. ""It was premised on an assumption based on public accounts – which the memorandum acknowledged may be incorrect – that the Special Counsel’s basis for questioning the President was that the firing of former FBI Director Comey constituted obstruction under a specific statute. ... In other words, the memorandum assumed, for purposes of analysis, that the Special Counsel’s sole predicate for interviewing the President was the single obstruction theory that it was addressing.""
Barr added, ""The memorandum did not address whether the President could be questioned under any of the other possible obstruction theories that have been publicly discussed in connection with the Special Counsel’s investigation, or any other theories of liability the Special Counsel may be pursuing.""
The president also did not ""comment on my memorandum,"" Barr added.
""On November 27, 2018, I met with the President and then-White House Counsel Emmet Flood to interview for the position of Attorney General,"" Barr wrote. ""After the President offered me the job, the conversation turned to issues that could arise during the confirmation process. I recall mentioning that I had written a memorandum regarding a legal issue that could arise in the Special Counsel’s investigation, and that the memorandum could result in questioning during my confirmation hearing. I do not remember exactly what I said, but I recall offering a brief, one-sentence description of the memorandum.""

"As President Trump threatened to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border in recent days, his Department of Homeland Security nearly doubled the number of temporary guest worker visas available this summer.
The Homeland Security and Labor departments plan to grant an additional 30,000 H-2B visas this summer on top of the 33,000 they had already planned to give out, the agencies confirmed.
The H-2B visa allows foreign workers to come to the United States legally and work for several months at companies such as landscapers, amusement parks or hotels. About 80 percent of these visas went to people from Mexico and Central America last year, government data shows.
Trump says there is a national emergency at the southern border because too many people are trying to come to the United States illegally or to seek asylum. On Friday, he implored migrants to turn around and go home.
Cant take you anymore, Trump said, while standing at the border in California. Our country is full. 
But his administration is sending a different message to some short-term workers. With the additional visas, the Trump administration is on track to grant 96,000 H-2B visas this fiscal year, the most since 2007, when George W. Bush was president.
[U.S. economy added 196,000 jobs in March]
Its ironic that Trump is demagoguing and railing against a so-called dangerous and scary flood of migrants and caravans from Mexico and Central America, and even threatening to shut down the border, while at the same time using his legal authority to grow a guest worker program, said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
A major theme of Trumps presidential campaign was that foreign workers were stealing U.S. jobs, but lately he has said it might be necessary to bring in more guest workers because the economy is doing so well that companies cant find enough people to fill jobs. The unemployment rate, at 3.8 percent, is near a 50-year low.
[Trumps Fed nominee Stephen Moore was found in contempt of court for failing to pay ex-wife more than $333,000]
There is bipartisan support in Congress pushing the administration to make this move. A group of senators, including Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), sent a letter to the Trump administration urging it to let in more H-2B workers. The Department of Homeland Security decided at the end of March to increase the number of visas offered and is expected to publish details in the Federal Register soon.
The H-2B program is supposed to grant 66,000 visas a year, with about half for the winter months and half for the summer, but Congress gave the Trump administration the authority to issue an additional 69,000 this fiscal year.
DHS ultimately decided to issue the extra 30,000 to people who have held H-2B visas before.
There is such a flood of interest in these visas that typically, they are all gone within minutes of the application process opening up. Trumps own hotels have used H-2B workers, and the presidents Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida applied for 78 of these visas last year.
Advocates for U.S. workers say Trump is undermining domestic workers by granting so many H-2B visas.
The Center for Immigration Studies, which urges lower immigration, said that Trump betrays American workers with this H-2B visa increase.
[From $22 an hour to $11: GM job cuts in Ohio show a hot economy is still leaving parts of America behind]
The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, put out research this week showing that H-2B visa workers are typically paid less than American workers who do the same jobs. For example, landscaping workers on the visa are paid an average of $12.94 an hour, more than a dollar less than the $14.28 average wage paid to U.S. workers, according to an analysis of data from the Labor Department and H-2B visa applications.
Many businesses that employ these workers say they pay the going rates in their regions.
Trump seems to be perfectly fine with letting people migrate to the United States if theyre going to be exploited workers, and especially if theyre going to work for one of his companies, Costa said.
Many firms say they are in desperate need of workers and have no other options. The government says it received 30 times more H-2B visa applications this year compared with last. Crab companies on Marylands Eastern Shore are among those trying to get more of these legal guest workers.
A DHS spokeswoman said Congress is in the best position to know the right number of H-2B visas that are needed for the economy. She said the department is urging Congress to fix the immigration system and set appropriate visa levels.
Trump has been hinting in recent weeks that he might allow more guest workers because the economy is doing so well.
I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place, he said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.

"Donald Trump Jr. got into a heated clash Thursday with Jim Acosta as he joined the Twitter army of people, including his father, mocking the CNN correspondent for a video that inadvertently made the case for a border wall.
Acosta, known for his dramatic flourishes that get under the skin of President Trump and for getting into fights with top Trump officials, posted the video during a visit to the border, coinciding with the president's trip.
“Here are some of the steel slats that the president’s been talking about,” Acosta said while reporting in Texas and touching a wall slat. “But as we’re walking along here, we’re not seeing any kind of imminent danger.”
CNN'S JIM ACOSTA MOCKED FOR ACCIDENTALLY PROVING THAT BORDER WALLS WORK
“There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence.”
Acosta then declared there was “no sign of the national emergency that the president has been talking about” and it was “tranquil” near him. He captioned the video, “I found some steel slats down on the border. But I don’t see anything resembling a national emergency situation.. at least not in the McAllen TX area of the border where Trump will be today.”
The tweet was met by a chorus of mockery, which included Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and even Trump himself -- who adopted Twitter user @neontaster’s game of prefacing any Acosta tweet with the words “Dear Diary.” They argued Acosta didn't see an emergency because he was at a section of the border protected by the kind of barrier Trump supports.
Trump Jr. then piled on, thanking Acosta for proving Trump’s point, “and simultaneously creating one of the best self-own videos ever!!!”
Acosta soon responded: “It’s a little strange Don. You guys seem to be saying the current measures in place are working. Does that mean your dad should reopen the government and get federal employees back to work? #byebye.”
CNN'S JIM ACOSTA DOUBLES DOWN ON HOW SAFE BORDER IS BEFORE TRUMP FIRES BACK
Trump Jr. responded: “I know this might be hard for you to comprehend Jimbo, but the reason why all of Twitter has been mocking you today is because you were at a part of the border WITH A WALL. So yes, of course it was working. Replicate that across the border &amp; we’ll all be safer. #RealNews #ByeBye”
To put a not-too-subtle finish to his point, the president’s son later retweeted a meme called, “Spotted: Jim Acosta playing golf earlier today” and showing a man with a CNN logo for a face getting run over by a Trump-like driver in a golf cart.
“Bye, go home to mommy,” the Trump voiceover says.

"(CNN)Another round of heavy rain is expected to hit parts of California on Wednesday and Thursday, putting millions of people under a flash-flood watch and spurring precautionary evacuations in several wildfire-scarred areas vulnerable to mudflows. 
In what should be the strongest in a series of recent storms, up to 3 inches of rain are expected in Southern California through Thursday and 6 inches could fall in central portions of the state.
The rain could lead to mudflows and flooding in areas burned by wildfires last year. 
Nearly 15 million people were under a flash-flood watch Wednesday morning from the Los Angeles area to central and northern parts of the state, the National Weather Service said.
Among the wildfire-scarred areas watching particularly closely for mudflows:
 Los Angeles County: Evacuations have been ordered for several communities with steep slopes deemed at risk for mudslides, especially after last year's Woolsey Fire scorched the area. Evacuation centers have been opened in Santa Monica and Agoura.
Schools in the seaside town of Malibu, which was hit by last year's fires, were closed Wednesday as a precaution.
""You can't outrun or fight these mudslides,"" Malibu Mayor Jefferson Wagner said in a video message Tuesday urging people to follow evacuation orders. ""Stay cautious, stay dry, and let's get through this next event without issue.""
Rainfall is expected to increase by noon Wednesday in Southern California ""and become heavier in the evening and overnight,"" the National Weather Service said.
Ventura County: Mandatory evacuations were issued Tuesday for parts of this county west of Los Angeles, including its south coast and the Matilija and Wheeler Springs areas.
Parts of the county were scorched by the Woolsey, Hill and Thomas fires.
""(The rain) may cause significant debris flows and flooding in the recent burn areas,"" the county's emergency information website reads. ""In addition, some rockslides can be expected along canyon roadways outside the burn areas.""
Butte County: The sheriff's office in this Northern California county urged evacuations in the town of Pulga, about a 100-mile drive north of Sacramento, from Tuesday night into Thursday morning.
""If flooding occurs, this can quickly become a dangerous and life-threatening situation,"" the sheriff's office said.
Parts of the county were burned last fall by the Camp Fire, the state's most deadly and destructive wildfire on record.
Strong winds and heavy snow, too
Wednesday's storms also are expected to bring strong winds to central and northern parts of California, including San Francisco. Wind gusts could reach around 60 mph.
And the storms will bring snow -- up to 6 inches -- to parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains. A blizzard warning is in effect into Thursday morning for elevations above 6,500 feet.

"CNN host Don Lemon managed to connect President Donald Trump to what has been called the “largest collegeadmissions scam ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice” on Tuesday night by saying the president also benefited from a rigged system that favors the elite.
Earlier in the day, law enforcement officials announced 50 indictments of those involved in a scheme for wealthy parents to fraud universities in accepting their children as students. Among the high-profile individuals swept up in controversy are TV actressesFelicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.
THIS IS CNN? PRIMETIME SHOWS FILLED WITH LIBERAL OPINION, NOT STRAIGHT NEWS AS NETWORK CLAIMS
When Lemon tackled the controversy during his opening monologue, he called it “disturbing” that such well-off families would go to such lengths to get their children into college and quickly pivoted to Trump.
The “CNN Tonight” host said that such a scandal can reinforce many people’s beliefs that the “system is rigged against them,” something he noted was a theme during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.
“This is what Donald Trump tapped into and in a lot of ways, guess what, he was right,” Lemon conceded before using the scandal as the impetus to mention the president's own upbringing.

“A lot of people will point out, and they have every right to do so, that Donald Trump himself is a beneficiary of a system that’s rigged in favor of the elite. Let’s not forget The New York Times investigation that revealed at age three, Donald Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today’s dollars,” Lemon told his viewers.
“He was a millionaire by age eight,” Lemon shrugged.

"The purpose of the bench wall in the new plan is solely to provide a pathway for access by maintenance workers and an emergency exit.
The parts to be removed would be replaced with a fiberglass or steel walkway that is considerably easier to install than a new concrete structure. Proven fiber-reinforced polymer a solution used to strengthen critical load-bearing infrastructure such as bridges would be used to further strengthen remaining bench wall.
In replacing only the damaged sections, the work can be done in increments on nights and weekends and we would avoid the total shutdown of the subway line. Our plan would also reduce the amount of hazardous silica dust that results from demolition of the bench wall. We recommend the whole process be monitored by an external agency to further ensure safety.
A high-tech laser system, known as Light Detection and Ranging, or Lidar, would be used to monitor the structural integrity of the bench wall and the tunnel itself. Smart fiber-optic sensor cables installed along the structure could detect any shifts or cracks, enabling the transit agency to identify, then repair or remove bench wall as needed in the years to come.
All other upgrades in the original plan increasing pump capacity, renovating track and stations, enhancing flood resiliency remain in our plan.
We are aware that our proposal is a unique approach to the tunnel restoration. Some have referred to it as a patch job but nothing could be further from the truth. 
We applaud the agency for its willingness to consider our recommendations. We hope this collaboration between the M.T.A. and our external team can serve as a model for the rest of the country as it addresses aging infrastructure.

"(CNN)The flooding in Nebraska has gotten so bad it's breaking records across the state. 
About 9 million people in 14 states along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers are under a flood warning, according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. 
Some of the records go as far back as 1960 and some are as recent as 2011, according to a press release from the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, or NEMA. The majority of the records NEMA listed involved the Missouri River, which crested between 30 and 47.5 feet in different areas throughout the state since Tuesday, breaking previous records by 1 to 4 feet. 
The Platte River in Louisville is expected to crest Sunday at 14.3 feet, breaking its 1960 record by 1.9 feet, NEMA said. The Elkhorn River at Waterloo crested at 24.6 feet on Saturday, breaking its 1962 record by 5.5 feet. 
Much of the major flooding is expected to continue through next weekend, NEMA said. The Elkhorn River is the only river whose major flooding was expected to decrease to moderate on Sunday. 
Floods are remnants of bomb cyclone
The continued flooding comes from the aftermath of the ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the central United States with hurricane-like winds and blizzard conditions last week, leaving in its tracks heavy rains and flooding.
CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said the water left by the bomb cyclone goes into streams and then rivers, causing the cresting and flooding. 
""Just because it stops raining doesn't mean rivers will stop cresting,"" Shackelford said. ""Rivers can crest days later."" 
Shackelford and Maginnis said flood risks will be high throughout the week in the Midwest and that river crests won't stop until the weekend. 
The National Weather Service in Omaha issued a flash flood warning for localities along the Nebraska-Iowa border. 
Two deaths attributed to flooding 
Hundreds of people have been rescued, NEMA said. The American Red Cross is operating 22 shelters that are housing about 660 people. The largest population the shelters have seen is 1,193, NEMA said. 
Two deaths have been attributed to the flooding. 
James Wilke, a Columbus farmer, died while trying to help emergency responders. Jodi L. Hefti, a close family friend, wrote on Facebook that Wilke got a call to assist emergency responders, according to CNN affiliate KMTV. Hefti said a bridge gave out while Wilke was driving his tractor over it. 
""James and the tractor went down into the floodwater below,"" Hefti said. 
A second Nebraska man died at a hospital in Lincoln after being caught in floodwaters across the state line in Iowa, according to the Fremont County, Iowa, Sheriff's Office. The victim, 55-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan of Norfolk, Nebraska, was one of three men trapped by flooding in the town of Riverton after their car was swept away and they tried to swim to safety.
All three were rescued -- Galan and another man were found ""hanging onto trees,"" according to the sheriff's office -- but Galan died from injuries, the sheriff's office said.
The car carrying the men had driven around a road-closed barrier then hit floodwaters, the sheriff's office said.

"If you think managing strength is hard, try managing weakness try attempting to put broken countries back together. Its hell on wheels. But that will be a big challenge for the next president because the mass migrations of people away from these disorderly and failing states to zones of order, which is what is driving the current U.S. and European border crises, are not going away.
Consider this Washington Post report last week: The number of people taken into custody along the Mexico border jumped an additional 31 percent last month as an unprecedented mass migration of families from Central America pushes unauthorized crossings to the highest levels in a decade, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures. 
The story added that last month, the busiest Februaryat the border since 2007, authorities detained 76,103 migrants, up from 58,207 in January, and it quoted Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as saying: The system is well beyond capacity and remains at a breaking point.
For the third trend, the next president will have to manage not only rival superpowers and disorder but also super-empowered small groups and individuals, because of how technology acceleration is putting incredibly powerful, cheap, small tools for cyberwarfare, election hacking and financial hacking into the hands of small units, vastly expanding their attack surfaces.
These cyber tools are all getting fast, cheap and deep. That is, they can go deeper inside your company, your email, your election, your power grid or your bank account every single day. This makes them easier to be weaponized by small units (like North Korea) and individuals so they can have outsize impacts through deep fake, deep surveillance, deep cyber theft.
Which brings us back to the thesis of The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth. The resurgent competition between us, China, Russia and Iran means that instead of our having their cooperation to try to manage state failure and the technological tsunami, the three revisionists are making them worse, Mandelbaum told me. 
Russia and Iran took the lead in devastating Syria, producing a flood of refugees that has, among other things, destabilized Europe. And all three have weaponized the new technology, hacking the U.S. and Europe and, in the case of Russia, even interfering with an American election.","So far, no Democratic candidate is claiming to be ready.",2019-03-12T23:32:33Z,Who to Elect for a Foreign Policy Crisis at 3 A.M.?,The New York Times,0

Blizzard and winter storm warnings extended from Minnesota through the Dakotas and down into Kansas on Thursday, with havoc on the roads for commuters and holiday travelers.
Central South Dakota, eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota can expect more than a foot of snow to fall by Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Winds gusting up to 50 mph in parts of those states would make driving conditions even more treacherous.
The Minnesota State Patrol asked drivers to take it slow on the slick roads as they were already responding to crashes and spinouts Wednesday night.
A travel alert was issued by the North Dakota Highway Patrol ""due to reduced visibility and snow fog creating 'whiteout' conditions.""
Meanwhile, to the east, flood watches were in effect West Virginia down to the Gulf Coast, with 2 to 4 inches of rainfall expected in that region, according to the weather service.

"Columbus, Miss. — A tornado smashed into a commercial district in the small Mississippi city of Columbus, shattering businesses as severe storms raked the South on a weekend of drenching rains and a rising flood threat.
The massive storm has dropped an ""incredible"" amount of rain in the Southeast over the past few days, dropping as much as one foot to 1.5 feet of rain in some areas of northern Mississippi, Alabama and into Tennessee, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli. 
The tornado that shattered businesses in the east Mississippi city on Saturday afternoon was confirmed on radar, said meteorologist Anna Wolverton with the National Weather Service in Jackson. She told The Associated Press that experts on Sunday would be headed Sunday to the city of about 23,000 people to gauge the tornado's intensity.
There were no immediate reports of any deaths or injuries.

Lee Lawrence, who said he has been selling used cars for decades in Columbus, told The AP that four buildings on his car lot had been destroyed. He said trees toppled across vehicles and car windows had been blown out. And he said he had no idea about how badly his collection of antique cars fared. A 1923 Studebaker and a 1930 Chevrolet were among the cars parked amid wind-tossed building debris.
Lawrence said he was at home getting ready to take a bath when the storm struck.
""The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close,"" he said, speaking with AP in a phone interview. He said someone called him soon after about the damage to his business and he rushed over.
""It will be a start-over deal,"" Lawrence said. ""I can't say it will come back better or stronger, but we'll come back.""
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrence's lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Firefighters and law enforcement officers had cordoned off the area, making it difficult to determine the extent of damages after nightfall. Power was out in the area.
Elsewhere around the South, homes, highways, parks and bridges have been flooded or put out of commission amid the heavy rains and severe storms. News outlets report that water rescues have been performed in some Middle Tennessee counties. Flash flood warnings and watches remained in place throughout the South and one Mississippi community reported large hail.

Interstate 40 near the Tennessee line with North Carolina was closed by a rockslide, one of the dozens of roads and highways shut down throughout the South region, transportation officials said.
Tennessee Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Nagi said on Twitter that a ""full scale detour"" was in place, with traffic being diverted to Interstate 81 and Interstate 26.
High water threatened property in Tennessee, which, like many other areas of the South, has been soaked by several inches of rain over the past week. Officials said a mudslide destroyed a Subway restaurant in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. No injuries were reported.
In Bruce, Mississippi, rivers broke flood stage and flash floods poured into homes and businesses. News outlets report that a local state of emergency was declared by officials in Grenada, Mississippi, after dozens of streets and homes flooded. A six-mile (nine-kilometer) stretch of the Natchez Trace Parkway was closed in Mississippi after water covered part of the road.
The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for northwestern Lafayette County in Mississippi after emergency officials reported that a local dam was at risk of failing. Meteorologist Kole Fehling says emergency officials reported the threat involved the Audubon Dam, which blocks a creek on the northside of Oxford and a subdivision.
Weather officials said the vast storm system threatened areas from eastern Arkansas far across the South to northern Georgia and beyond. And Alabama's governor declared a state of emergency in several counties, hoping to speed recovery in event of damages.
Kentucky announced Friday that it was closing the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois, because of flooding on the southern approach. The bridge, which carries 4,700 vehicles a day, is likely to stay closed until Thursday, and possibly longer.
Near Jamestown, Kentucky, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing releases from the Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River. Areas located downstream of the dam, from Rowena to Burkesville, could be affected by flooding as a result, officials said.
The Ohio River at Cairo is predicted to crest Sunday at its third-highest level ever recorded, and stay that high into next week.

"Beira, Mozambique -- More than a thousand people are feared to have died in a cyclone that smashed into Mozambique last week, while scores were killed and more than 200 are missing in neighboring Zimbabwe. The city of Beira in central Mozambique bore Cyclone Idai's full wrath on Thursday before the storm barrelled on to neighbouring Zimbabwe, unleashing fierce winds and flash floods and washing away roads and houses.
""For the moment we have registered 84 deaths officially, but when we flew over the area... this morning to understand what's going on, everything indicates that we could register more than 1,000 deaths,"" Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address.
""This is a real humanitarian disaster,"" he said. ""More than 100,000 people are in danger"".
Survivors have taken refuge in trees while awaiting help, the president added.
Aerial photographs released by a Christian non-profit organisation, the Mission Aviation Fellowship, showed groups of people stuck on rooftops with flood waters up to window level.
""The scale of damage... (in) Beira is massive and horrifying"", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.

""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous,"" the IFRC's Jamie LeSueur said.
""Almost everything is destroyed. Communication lines have been completely cut and roads have been destroyed. Some affected communities are not accessible.""
A large dam burst on Sunday and cut off the last road to Beira, he said.
Sofala province governor Alberto Mondlane warned that the ""biggest threat we have now, even bigger than the cyclone, is floods because it's raining more and more"".
Emma Beaty, coordinator of a grouping of NGOs known as Cosaco, said: ""We've never had something of this magnitude before in Mozambique"".

"A powerful storm bearing down on California will likely deliver near hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall, and up to 10 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada. The storm will begin wreaking havoc in Northern California late Friday afternoon and reach the southern part of the state late in the night, according to forecasters.
This is likely the strongest storm of the winter so far for California, CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli reports. It is being fueled by a very strong Pacific Jet Stream and unusually warm ocean waters partly associated with an El Nino-like pattern.
The system will look like a textbook storm by Friday night, with a hurricane-like eye forming, Berardelli reports. It is expected to last through Saturday night.
The storm is expected to bring damaging winds,
CBS
Winter storm warnings will be in effect up and down the Sierra Nevada along with a flash flood watch in the foothills above the San Joaquin Valley, according to The Associated Press.
Berardelli reports that rainfall rates will be up to 1 inch per hour for coastal areas from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Rain that heavy is capable of causing rapid flash floods and mudslides. 
The storm is expected to produce heavy rainfall.
CBS
Winds will gust to near-hurricane force on the hills along the coast. The ski resorts in the Sierra Nevada Mountains could get 3-6 feet of snow this weekend and early next week – and some areas could even get up to 10 feet.
The storm will likely bring heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada.

Meanwhile, authorities have issued flash flood watches for the wildfire burn areas of Southern California. Santa Barbara County officials said they would issue an evacuation order for three fire-scarred areas unless the storm doesn't materialize as expected.  
Powerful rains drenched Southern California as the first of three storms arrived in the region Thursday. CBS Los Angeles reported heavy rain and thunderstorms started early in Santa Barbara County, and moved south into Ventura and Los Angeles counties during the morning. 
The city of Malibu shut down Zuma Beach due to lightning strikes. Beachgoers at all Los Angeles County beaches were told to seek shelter in the event of lightning, and Santa Monica city officials urged people to evacuate all ocean and beach/sand areas.

"Valley, Neb. (Reuters) - As icy, lethal flood waters fed by rains and melting snow recede in Nebraska and Iowa, leaving destroyed homes, drowned cattle and swamped farmland, Midwest states downstream were set on Thursday for a relentless surge of the Missouri River. 
Flooding from last week’s storm has already caused nearly $1.5 billion in damage in Nebraska, killed at least four people with another missing. 
“This isn’t over,” said David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. 
“The river will have several more major crests through next week,” he said, not counting the numerous tributaries that feed into the Missouri up and down the Midwest and will likely inundate communities into next month. 
The waters have already swamped a large swath of Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa along North America’s longest river. A state of emergency has been declared in all or parts of the three Midwestern farm states 
“We’re going to get some moderate rain this weekend over eastern Nebraska, maybe a half inch (1.3 cm),” Roth said. “It doesn’t sound like much, but any more precipitation is bad.” 
The Missouri River’s next major flood crest is forecast to hit St. Joseph, Missouri, at 6 a.m. on Friday and a day later in Kansas City, Missouri, 55 miles (90 km) to the south, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
“Where the Missouri meets the Mississippi River in St. Charles (Missouri), it has already peaked but it’s going to crest again early next week,” meteorologist Roth said. 
More than 2,400 Nebraska homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, with 200 miles (320 km) of roads unusable and 11 bridges wiped out, Governor Pete Ricketts said on Wednesday. 
Ricketts estimated the floods caused at least $439 million in damage to public infrastructure and other assets, and $85 million to privately owned assets. He put flood damage for the state’s agricultural sector at nearly $1 billion. 
Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, which houses the U.S. Strategic Command, remained heavily flooded but operational, officials said Wednesday. 
In Valley, Nebraska, outside Omaha, Pete Smock, 42, worked to clear deep mud surrounding his home and construction business Wednesday in what will be a long cleanup for the region. 
“Devastation is everywhere. I haven’t seen anything like this in my lifetime,” Smock said.

"(Reuters) - The powerful late winter storm, dubbed a “bomb cyclone” by meteorologists, left blizzards, floods and tornados in its wake after hitting the U.S. Mountain and Plains states this week, before pushing east into the Midwest and the Great Lakes Region early Friday. 
A disaster proclamation by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, issued in response to reports of flooding, remained in effect in Iowa overnight. 
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts also issued an emergency declaration. There were many impassable bridges and roads from rain swollen, rivers and dam breaches, prompting thousands of residents to evacuate in Nebraska, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. 
Thirteen tornados were reported Thursday in Kentucky, Indiana and Michigan, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, but no immediate reports of serious damage. 
Meteorologists referred to the storm as a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. 
At the height of the storm, two feet of snow was dumped in the mountain regions of Colorado, forcing the cancellation of more than 1,300 flights in Denver and leading to more than 1,000 motorists trapped on roadsides, with many having to be rescued by police using school buses to ferry them to safety. 
There were no remaining blizzard warnings Friday, Oravec said. 
“There’s still a good threat of thunderstorms in Louisiana, Mississippi and up into the Great Lakes region as the system pushes into Canada, but it’s not like it was,” he said. 
Most power outages were cleared by early Friday, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.US and air traffic was returned to normal at Denver International Airport, a regional hub hardest hit by the storm. 
Flood warnings and watches remained in effect for Nebraska, Iowa and Michigan, forecasters said.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday that U.S. sanctions were impeding aid workers from sending helicopters to flood-hit regions of the country because of the poor state of the national helicopter fleet. 
The country has announced an emergency situation in southern 
provinces threatened by flooding and has evacuated dozens of villages as forecasters predicted more of the heavy rains that have killed more than 45 people. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that U.S. sanctions were “impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedCrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods.” 
“Blocked equipment includes relief choppers: This isn’t just economic warfare; it’s economic TERRORISM.” 
A deal with world powers on Tehran’s nuclear program in 2015 opened the way for Iranian airlines to update their fleets, but U.S President Donald Trump withdrew from that deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran. 
Floods have affected at least 23 out of Iran’s 31 provinces since heavy downpours began on March 19. Western and southwestern parts of the country are expected to bear the brunt of the storms in the days ahead. 
The commander of the army’s ground forces told state television that 20 of their helicopters were deployed to flooded areas to evacuate villagers. 
Police renewed calls for people to avoid unnecessary journeys even though Iran is celebrating the Nowruz new year holiday, a time when many families travel. 
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last week that it was ready to offer help to Iran, but challenges caused by U.S. sanctions could affect the U.N. response.

"LONDON (Reuters) - President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday inspected damage caused by flash floods in northern Iran and promised compensation to all those affected, as the nationwide death toll from what he called an “unprecedented” natural disaster reached 26. 
Rouhani, accused by critics of mishandling the crisis, took several cabinet ministers with him to Golestan Province, whose governor was dismissed on Saturday amid public outrage over his absence from work. He had been abroad when the disaster hit. 
At least 26 people have been confirmed dead and hundreds suffered injuries in the floods, officials said on Wednesday. 
In a country more accustomed to drought, Rouhani said the floods, caused by torrential rain, had affected 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces and that the scale of the disaster had overwhelmed emergency services in some areas. 
“The government will use all means and will compensate all those who have sustained damages to their houses, businesses and farms,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by the state media. 
Rouhani’s hardline rivals have accused the government of doing too little, too late. The head of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi, said on Tuesday that officials who mishandled the disaster and caused the death of civilians could face prosecution. 
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, and thousands put in emergency shelters provided by the government, state media said. 
Iran is celebrating the Nowrouz new year holidays, a time when many families travel around the country, but police asked people to avoid unnecessary journeys. 
National Iranian Gas Company said its pipeline network across the country had not been affected by the floods and that domestic and industrial consumers should not be concerned.

Late winter's deadly flooding could turn into catastrophic spring flooding in the Midwest and beyond, forecasters said.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ""spring outlook"" issued Thursday came with dire warnings, even as flooding was already tormenting states including Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. ""More than 200 million people are at risk for flooding in their communities,"" Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said in a statement.
Three deaths from the Midwest flooding have been confirmed, and on Thursday, President Donald Trump approved Nebraska's request for federal disaster assistance. The Nebraska National Guard used helicopters Thursday to drop hay bales to feed cows stranded by floodwaters.
Heavy rain supplemented by rapid snow melt has widened rivers and put farms underwater. But Mary C. Erickson, deputy director of National Weather Service, on Thursday warned that the trouble may just be beginning.
""The major flooding weve already experienced across the lower Missouri [River region] and the lower to middle Mississippi [River] valley is a preview to what we expect the rest of the spring,"" she said. ""In fact, we expect the flooding will get worse and become more widespread.""
The outlook states that spring, which this year concludes on June 20, could bring major or moderate flooding in 25 states, with at least two-thirds of the continental United States expected to see an ""elevated"" flood risk and above-average precipitation.

""Additional spring rain and melting snow will prolong and expand flooding, especially in the central and southern U.S.,"" the federal outlook reads. ""As this excess water flows downstream through the river basins, the flood threat will become worse and geographically more widespread.""
Erickson said flooding could stretch into May.
""The communities in the high-risk threat areas need to prepare for impacts as the floodwaters move down the river system,"" she said.
Jack Boston, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said the private forecaster has a similar outlook for spring, with most of the flooding in Missouri and Mississippi river regions likely occurring in April.

With as much as 19 inches of snow on the ground in parts of the Dakotas and a lot of snow remaining in western Minnesota, the situation doesn't bode well, he said: ""All that snow has to melt.""
California and Colorado mountains also have above-normal snow pack that has been boosted by a weak El Niño weather condition in the Pacific, he said.
That could contribute to spring avalanches, Boston said.

"Residents in parts of southwestern Iowa were forced out of their homes Sunday as a torrent of Missouri River water flowed over and through levees, putting them in a situation similar to hundreds of people in neighboring Nebraska who have been displaced by the late-winter flooding.
In all, thousands of people have been evacuated in Nebraska and Iowa, where disaster declarations have been issued. Flood warnings and watches are in effect for at least a dozen states.
Heavy rainfall and snowmelt have led to dangerously high water in creeks and rivers across several Midwestern states, with the Missouri River hitting record-high levels in many areas. Many major roadways and interstates are shut down.
At least two deaths were blamed on flooding, and two other men have been missing for days.
While river depths were starting to level off in parts of Nebraska on Sunday, the water is so high in many places that serious flooding is expected to remain for several days. And downstream communities in Kansas and Missouri were bracing for likely flooding.

Some residents are still out of their homes and roads are closed throughout Wisconsin due to severe flooding. 
But, forecasters say drier weather there this week should give cresting rivers and streams a chance to recede. Shelters at a church in Fond du Lac County and at Preble High School in Green Bay remain open.
In Iowa, the Missouri River reached 30.2 feet Sunday in Fremont County in the state's far southwestern corner, 2 feet above the record set in 2011. People in the towns of Bartlett and Thurman were being evacuated as levees were breached and overtopped.
County Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius said it wasn't just the amount of the water, it was the swiftness of the current that created a danger.
""This wasn't a gradual rise,"" Crecelius said. ""It's flowing fast and it's open country - there's nothing there to slow it down.""
Thurman has about 200 residents. About 50 people live in Bartlett.
Lucinda Parker of Iowa Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management said nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated at eight Iowa locations since flooding began late last week. Most were staying with friends or family. Seven shelters set up for flood victims held just a couple dozen people Saturday night.
In Nebraska, the Missouri River flooded Offutt Air Force Base, with about one-third of it under water on Sunday. Spokeswoman Tech. Sgt. Rachelle Blake told the Omaha World-Herald that 60 buildings, mostly on the south end of the base, have been damaged, including about 30 completely inundated with as much as 8 feet of water.
Hundreds of people remained out of their homes in Nebraska, where floodwaters reached record levels at 17 locations. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency highlighted some remarkably high crests. The Elkhorn River got to 24.6 feet Saturday in Waterloo, breaking the 1962 record by 5-1/2 feet.
The water there stretches as far as the eye can see, reports CBS News correspondent DeMarco Morgan.
The National Weather Servie Omaha office tweeted that the Missouri River had broken records at Plattsmouth:

In hard-hit Sarpy County, Nebraska, up to 500 homes have been damaged, including some cabins along a lake, said Greg London of the Sarpy County Sheriff's Office. The damage followed breaches of levees along the Platte River on Thursday and Saturday, and a Missouri River levee break on Thursday. The two rivers converge there.
London said many of the damaged homes are wet up to the roof line and likely ruined.
""This area's had flooding before but not of this magnitude,"" London said. ""This is unprecedented.""
Nearly 300 people have been rescued from high water across the state.
At least two people have died in the floodwaters. Aleido Rojas Galan, 52, of Norfolk, Nebraska, was swept away Friday night in southwestern Iowa, when the vehicle he was in went around a barricade. Two others in the vehicle survived - one by clinging to a tree. On Thursday, Columbus, Nebraska, farmer James Wilke, 50, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to try and reach stranded motorists.
Two men remain missing. A Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away. Water also swept away a man after a dam collapse.
Downstream in St. Joseph, Missouri, home to 76,000 people, volunteers were helping to fill sandbags to help secure a levee protecting an industrial area. Calls were out for even more volunteers in hopes of filling 150,000 sandbags by Tuesday, when the Missouri River is expected to climb to 27 feet - 10 feet above technical flood stage.
Flooding was causing problems for passenger train service between Kansas City, Missouri, and St. Louis. Amtrak said Sunday that its Missouri River Runner service between the state's two largest cities was experiencing delays up to five hours because of flooding and rail congestion. All Missouri River Runner trains will be canceled Monday. The service typically travels twice daily between the two metropolitan areas.
The rising Mississippi River also was creating concern. The Mississippi was already at major flood level along the Iowa-Illinois border, closing roads and highways and swamping thousands of acres of farmland. Moderate Mississippi River flooding was expected at several Missouri cities, including St. Louis.
Flooding has also been reported in Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, officials said residents who evacuated their homes could return now that floodwaters have receded there.",Missouri River setting flooding records in many areas and close eye being kept on rising Mississippi,2019-03-18T11:01:51Z,"Historic, deadly flooding forces thousands to evacuate in Midwest",CBS News,1
"In the mountains far above the red-brick city, behind a locked gate, there is a great, green valley. Its high stone walls are streaked by waterfalls; its floor dotted with flowers and grazed by horses and cows. Six boulder-strewn miles beyond the gate, the valley ends abruptly at an enormous wall of rock and ice. Beneath it lies a stretch of calm, bright water in milky turquoise — Lake Palcacocha. Though few of its residents have ever seen this lake, the city below lives in fear of it.
On Dec. 13, 1941, a piece broke off a hanging glacier and fell into Palcacocha, creating a great wave that overwhelmed a natural dam and sent a flood surging toward Huaraz, a provincial capital in the Peruvian Andes, about 14 miles below. A third of the city was destroyed and at least 1,800 people were killed. In response, the government reinforced the natural dam and installed drainage tubes to lower the level of the lake. Huaraz boomed to 130,000 inhabitants from 20,000. Occasionally there was a scare — a rock slide into the lake in 2003 sloshed a smaller amount of water over the edge, causing panic — but to many people in Huaraz the danger began to seem remote. Until it became clear that the lake was getting bigger.
In 2009, glaciologists found that amid the widespread melting of Andean ice, the amount of water held in Palcacocha had increased by 3,400 percent over just a couple of decades. Even more worrying, this melt associated with climate change was destabilizing the glaciers hanging above it, making major avalanches more likely. The regional government declared a state of emergency and began posting guardians to watch the lake around the clock.
The guardians of the lake live above Palcacocha, in a little stone house with a tin roof. It was built by hand from nearby rocks and has no insulation, though at 15,000 feet the air is thin and the cold brutal, even in summer. There is no heat apart from a cook fire, and few supplies: raincoats, warm blankets, flashlights for working at night, snowshoes for working in winter.
On a cold summer day in February, I looked up from the lake to see a man descending a zigzagging trail. He walked lightly across loose boulders to the water’s edge, where a large ruler pierced the surface. He read it, and then turned to climb the switchbacks back to the hut, where a radio was wired to what looked like a car battery. It was his job, shared with two other men, to report on the status of the water levels every two hours, day and night.
The man introduced himself as Víctor Morales, one of the guardians. I followed him up to the hut, where we listened to the rumble of falling ice echoing repeatedly off the high walls around the lake. Seeing me jump as yet another distant waterfall of white tumbled down, Morales laughed and said in Spanish: “Little! Just a little avalanche.” He would mark the activity on his next report, he said, as “minimal,” far less than the fall two weeks before, which raised 12-foot waves in the placid lake. That one he described, with a shrug, as “regularcito.” Should a more substantial avalanche happen, something that researchers consider a significant risk, the resulting flood would careen down the valley, overwhelming houses and farms until it arrived in Huaraz. According to the best available estimates, even without a collapse of the glacial moraine, a wall of rock that serves as the lake’s natural dam, which is considered unlikely, a large avalanche could lead to the inundation of 154 city blocks and more than 6,000 deaths. The regional government has considered various solutions: lowering the lake level by another 60 to 100 feet; creating a more technologically advanced early-warning system with sensors and sirens; plastering the city with evacuation maps. “We want a map in every schoolchild’s notebook,” César Portocarrero Rodríguez, an engineer and glaciologist in Huaraz, says.
One of the first neighborhoods to be flooded would be Nueva Florida, blocks of brick-and-adobe homes that edge the stream from the canyon. Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a soft-spoken, 39-year-old farmer and father of two who also works as a mountain guide during the tourist season, lives there in a bright yellow house, across the street from Morales’s parents; the families have known each other for decades. Many people in Huaraz, Luciano Lliuya told me, don’t fully appreciate the sacrifices that the guardians make to do their jobs — in part because they don’t fully realize the dangers of deglaciation. Over the years, Luciano Lliuya has seen lakes expanding and avalanches increasing and ice retreating with every climb; he has seen farmers begin to argue over diminishing clean water. The loss of ice, it is clear to him, means a future that’s more uncertain in all kinds of ways. “I depend, in every sense, on the mountain,” he told me. “It is everything.”
One day, five years ago, Luciano Lliuya sat talking with a friend about the many changes and costs that climate change is bringing to the Andes, whose residents have, by global standards, done very little to contribute to the problem. “We wondered,” he said, “whether we could find los responsables” — the responsible ones — and somehow persuade them to change their behavior. He wanted, fervently, to find a way to stop the ice from melting even more.
Luciano Lliuya’s friend introduced him to a contact at a nongovernment organization called Germanwatch, based in Bonn, that works to promote equity between developed and less-developed countries. In 2015, with the group’s support, Luciano Lliuya, who had never left his country, traveled 6,500 miles to file a lawsuit against RWE, Germany’s largest energy utility. The lawsuit claimed that the company, though it does not operate in Peru, had contributed about half of 1 percent of the emissions that are causing the global climate to change and that it should therefore be responsible for half of 1 percent of the cost of containing the lake that might destroy Luciano Lliuya’s house. His claim entered the courts in the form of a demand for $19,000.
“There weren’t high hopes,” Luciano Lliuya said — either that a lawsuit would have any real effect on how quickly the glaciers were melting or that he would actually be able to make the case, in court, that Huaraz’s woes were the fault of a company an ocean away. But he didn’t know what else to do, and he felt he had to do something: “It was like ... a shout.”
Legal systems have long struggled with the best way to respond when individuals have been harmed by others. Who qualifies as a victim, and what counts as a misdeed? How can harm be traced and measured? If it can’t be undone, what might make things right? Nearly 4,000 years ago, the Code of Hammurabi decreed harsh restitution for dozens of situations. If, for example, someone failed to maintain his dam and it failed, flooding a neighbor’s fields, the negligent dam owner should “be sold for money, and the money shall replace the corn which he has caused to be ruined.” Anglo-Saxon law offered wergild, set amounts to be paid by offenders to the families of their victims, in atonement for murder or adultery. In seventh-century Kent, the lives of freemen were valued at 100 shillings, noblemen at 300.
In the modern era, common-law countries such as the United States have turned to the courts to sift through the complexities of injury, causation and remedy. Common law, as distinct from statutory law, applies in situations where no legislative guidelines have been set and courts instead respond to cases as they happen — leaning on, and adding to, centuries of accumulated decisions interpreting the basic legal idea that individuals have uninfringible rights. Modern cases that take on environmental damage rest on a heritage that includes, for example, William Aldred’s complaint, in the early 1600s, that the stench from a pigsty built by his neighbor Thomas Benton made his home unbearable.
[Read David Leonhardt on the economics of climate change.]
Today, Benton’s action would be considered a tort, a harm or an infringement of a legal right that requires redress. To sue, plaintiffs in tort cases must show they have sufficient connection to a specific harm (what’s called standing); that the defendant owed them some duty of care and breached it; that the harm was particular to the plaintiff and that the defendant’s action was a direct cause of that harm; and that they, the plaintiff, suffered an actual injury or damage — including, perhaps, a future one. First-year law students are initiated into how fraught these seemingly simple questions can become when they study an infamous 1928 lawsuit involving a package that exploded on a train platform in Brooklyn and a woman, Helen Palsgraf, who was injured in the ensuing confusion. That’s the short version; the single injury claim involves, as the Wake Forest law professor Jonathan Cardi has noted, “a series of bizarre twists so curious and mesmerizing that one has trouble averting one’s gaze.” The case, whose details and lessons are still being argued, was repeatedly appealed. Some of the great jurists of the day weighed in, eloquently debating the responsibilities that humans have toward one another, especially when they harm one another indirectly, in ways that are difficult to foresee. If an act “has a tendency to harm someone, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene,” wrote one of the judges. “We draw an uncertain and wavering line, but draw it we must as best we can.”
Tort law has, of course, weighed injuries far trickier than Helen Palsgraf’s. State courts in particular have a history of offering remedies to complex and evolving claims. Mesothelioma patients and their families routinely win monetary relief despite not being able to trace precisely which product was the source of decades-old asbestos exposure (and despite the fact that more than 100 companies tied to the asbestos industry have declared bankruptcy, leaving trusts behind to deal with the continuing suits). Oil companies have paid hundreds of millions of dollars since the mid-2000s in recompense to states and local governments for using a gasoline additive that, while employed to help meet clean-air standards, turned out to pollute groundwater (a fact the companies kept to themselves). Beginning in the 1990s, courts began to find tobacco companies liable for the health effects of cigarette smoking, even though smokers used their products willingly and even though the first 800 or so lawsuits against the companies failed. In recent years, more than a thousand lawsuits have sought to make pharmaceutical companies pay for the sprawling costs of the opioid-addiction crisis, including the costs of hospital visits, overwhelmed foster-care systems and overburdened coroner’s offices. (In March, Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, agreed to a $270 million settlement in just one of those cases, avoiding going to trial in state court in Oklahoma.)
Now a new wave of lawsuits is testing whether fossil-fuel companies can be made to pay for the costs of climate change. Since 2017, eight United States cities, including New York and San Francisco, six counties, one state and the West Coast’s largest association of fishermen have brought suit against a host of corporations — Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, Peabody Energy, among others — for selling products that caused the world to warm while misleading the public about the damage they knew would result. The suits demand compensation for a variety of expenses: in California, sea walls and infrastructure to cope with rising waters; in Colorado, the costs of combating wildfires, floods, pine beetle infestations, agricultural losses and heat waves.
A separate legal argument underpins a parallel set of new cases, the most famous of which was brought in 2015 by a group of American children, which target governments for failing to adequately tackle climate change and uphold what one judge called “the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life.” Another track is to sue companies for misleading their shareholders, in violation of securities law. In November, Ralph Regenvanu, the foreign minister of the Pacific nation of Vanuatu, offered a glimpse of what may become a new reality: “My government is now exploring all avenues to utilize the judicial system in various jurisdictions, including under international law, to shift the costs of climate protection back onto the fossil-fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country.”
Ann Carlson, faculty co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at U.C.L.A. School of Law, says that lawsuits linking fossil-fuel companies to the climate impacts of their products could set significant legal precedents. “If one of these cases succeeds,” she says, “even if all the others are dismissed, that’s a really big deal. That’s why companies will fight tooth and nail.” But while Luciano Lliuya’s suit was accepted by a regional appeals court in Germany in late 2017 and is now moving into the evidentiary phase, none of the recent United States lawsuits has moved beyond preliminary consideration and into discovery, never mind an actual trial. The question remains whether the American tort system is prepared to litigate a problem of the enormous scale and complexity of global climate change. “Diffuse and disparate in origin, lagged and latticed in effect, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions represent the paradigmatic anti-tort,” Douglas A. Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, wrote in a 2011 paper, “a collective-action problem so pervasive and so complicated as to render at once both all of us and none of us responsible.”
We are still learning what dangers will arise from our altered atmosphere. Some changes, such as warmer ocean water taking up more space and pushing into cities, have a direct, calculable cause. Others, like powerful tropical cyclones or abnormally heavy flood-producing rains, are more indirect products of the ways in which humans are affecting the climate. The largest challenge to adjudicating responsibility for these damages is proving attribution: of specific damages or disasters to climate change; of climate change to specific emissions; of emissions to those responsible for them. In an early test case filed in 2008, an Alaska Native village sought to make energy companies pay for its relocation, which the disappearance of its protective barrier of sea ice necessitated. A United States District Court judge, dismissing the case, wrote, “There is no realistic possibility of tracing any particular alleged effect of global warming to any particular emissions by any specific person, entity, group at any particular point in time.”
But eight years after calling climate change “the paradigmatic anti-tort,” Kysar recently told me that “a fair number of things have changed.” Scientists have gotten better at quantifying the links between emissions and impacts. When the links are indirect, they calculate what’s known in epidemiology as “fraction of attributable risk”: how much more likely it was that an extreme event would occur because of an altered climate. Plaintiffs also argue that they don’t need to prove that specific disasters were directly caused by climate change, because climate change makes future disasters more likely and governments must take expensive steps to adapt now. We also know more about the ways fossil-fuel companies misdirected the public about the risks associated with their products and about how much companies actually emitted. “What I see right now are well-pled complaints that should get beyond a dismissal motion and proceed to discovery,” Kysar says. “For better or for worse, that’s been our process in determining wrongdoing.”
[One storied American institution is ready for the coming climate chaos: the Pinkertons.]
To implicate specific companies, the new lawsuits have turned to data collected by Richard Heede, director of the Climate Accountability Institute in Snowmass, Colo., who has spent much of the past 16 years searching through archives to find reports about how much fossil-fuel companies extracted during their sometimes long histories. He then estimates how much fossil fuel was used for a company’s own operations, how much diverted for things like asphalt or petrochemical production, how much volatilized into the atmosphere. The work is tedious, involving hundreds of thousands of data points and a basement full of dusty reports. Still, Heede told me, “we needed that kind of leverage in order to talk turkey with oil and gas companies.”
Heede’s work reveals that, if you include all the carbon extracted and supplied, just 90 companies are responsible for two-thirds of all the greenhouse gases emitted between 1751 and 2016. Even more startling, more than half those emissions have occurred since 1988, the year that the climate scientist James Hansen, then at NASA, appeared before Congress to urge that “it is time to stop waffling” and recognize the clear link between the emission of greenhouse gases and the warming of the planet.
Heede’s data underpins many of the new United States lawsuits, as well as Luciano Lliuya’s claim about RWE’s share of climate emissions. Plaintiffs believe that they can establish fault that meets the required standard of substantially contributing to a harm by combining these estimates with recent revelations that oil companies had knowledge of the climate dangers of fossil fuels as early as the 1960s but actively worked to undermine the public’s trust in climate science. (Even as they privately prepared for climate impacts on their operations, companies followed a public strategy of emphasizing doubts about the growing scientific consensus that their products would lead to climate change.) According to Carlson, in the first test cases of climate liability (the Alaska village lawsuit and a case brought by eight states, New York City and three environmental groups in 2005 against five power companies, including the Tennessee Valley Authority), “the courts seemed to be worried, like: ‘Oh, did these people really cause the problem? Some power plants, maybe 2 percent?’ ” Now, she says, “it feels like you have the big contributors right in front of you.” Roda Verheyen, the lawyer representing Luciano Lliuya, concurs. “I long to present Heede in court,” she said. “Just because it’s a complex issue doesn’t mean that you can’t prove liability.”
The year before Luciano Lliuya was born, his father decided to move his six children — Saúl was the seventh and last — from the countryside above Huaraz to the Nueva Florida house, where they could be close to school and he to his job as a watchman. (The family also kept a house and land in the hills for raising crops and animals, which Luciano Lliuya and his wife, Lidia, still maintain. They have seven cows and raise corn, potatoes, quinoa and mint.) Land in Nueva Florida was relatively cheap; when people dig into the soil, Luciano Lliuya told me when I visited, they regularly find huge boulders, reminders of the 1941 flood.
It wasn’t guiding season, but Luciano Lliuya was dressed in hiking gear; Lidia wore the tall bowler hat and wide woolen skirt that is common to the mountains. She spoke mostly in Quechua, which is also Luciano Lliuya’s first language, while he translated to Spanish. Luciano Lliuya is currently renovating the house, replacing adobe walls with concrete, so everyone sat on the floor or on overturned buckets. “If I said, ‘It’s a flood zone, I won’t fix the house,’ that would look crazy,” Luciano Lliuya mused. “But it’s also crazy to do it knowing the danger, no? From both sides, it’s crazy.”
[Read about how Wall Street is hedging against the apocalypse.]
The technical term for the disaster that threatens Huaraz is glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF, a fairly obscure offender in a lineup of climate impacts that includes famine-inducing droughts, the acidification and deoxygenation of the oceans and the inundation of cities like New York and Jakarta. But GLOFs are a growing concern not just in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca, the mountain region where Huaraz is — hundreds of square kilometers of ice have melted in recent decades, creating at least 100 new lakes and more risk of flooding from existing ones — but also in the Himalayas and the Alps.
As Luciano Lliuya’s case makes its way through the German court system, court-appointed experts have been assigned to investigate his claims against RWE. First, hydrologists and other scientists will study how much danger the house in Nueva Florida faces. If they confirm the danger exists, the court will consider how much, if any, of the responsibility lies with RWE. The company, for its part, has objected to the entire premise of the case. “It is simply not allowed to pick one out of a million and say, ‘You are guilty, I put the blame on you,’ ” Guido Steffen, a spokesman for RWE, told me. Should such lawsuits be allowed, he continued, a person might be sued for flying in planes or driving a car. “It would mean the war of everybody against everybody,” he said.
German courts do not use common law, but the statute under which Luciano Lliuya sued is similar to the nuisance principle invoked in many of the United States lawsuits: the legal category of “nuisance,” one of the oldest torts. It has played a role in innumerable public health, pollution and injury cases since the dispute over Thomas Benton’s stinky pigsty. Companies targeted by lawsuits in the United States also put forward arguments similar to the one made by RWE: Climate change is simply too vast an issue for courts to be able to respond adequately to the injuries it causes. There are too many contributors, too many tangled chains linking emitters to harms, too many benefits to be weighed against costs and too many consequences for national and international policy if demands for redress are actually met. They argue that responding to greenhouse-gas emissions should fall to the legislative and executive branches (though those branches have in fact failed to regulate emissions) and that cases should be moved to federal court, where judges, including the justices of the Supreme Court, have found that common-law climate claims are superseded by federal law (including the Clean Air Act, under which a 2007 Supreme Court decision determined that the E.P.A. must treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant).
These arguments have helped persuade judges to dismiss climate lawsuits before they can move on to document discovery or the testimony of experts. “The dangers raised in the complaints are very real,” wrote Judge William Alsup, when dismissing suits brought against five oil companies by Oakland, Calif., and San Francisco last year. “But those dangers are worldwide. Their causes are worldwide. The benefits of fossil fuels are worldwide. The problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public-nuisance case.” Indeed, the sheer vastness of the climate problem has been a boon to defendants. “If I were the fossil-fuel company,” says William Ruskin, who has spent his career defending large companies in environmental litigation, “I’d open this up as broadly as possible. I’d talk about the industrial revolution. I would basically create a historical tableau and put civilization on trial.”
For plaintiffs in the new wave of cases, however, such defenses represent a fundamental misunderstanding not only of what the lawsuits are claiming but also of what the law is capable of handling. Kate Sears is a supervisor of Marin County, which is suing to recoup the costs of combating more extreme and more persistent flooding; she is also a lawyer and was part of California’s suit against banks for deceptive mortgage practice that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, which resulted in the state’s receiving a multibillion-dollar settlement in 2012. “These are accepted and established and sort of tried-and-true claims in state courts,” Sears says. “We’re not trying to create new law here,” adding, “We’re just trying to get damages for injuries caused.” Last year a federal judge agreed, sending the case, now joined with others filed by California cities and counties, back to the court. Vic Sher, whose firm is handling that case as well as suits brought by Baltimore and Rhode Island, says that the lawsuits pose a simple question: “Should those costs be paid for by the taxpayers or by the companies who knew what they were doing and caused the impacts?”
San Francisco, New York and Oakland are all appealing the federal dismissals of their cases, and the two sides continue to wrangle over where the suits belong. In an amicus brief in the New York case, eight states and the District of Columbia argued that the refusal to hear the lawsuit in state court “would lead to the extraordinary conclusion that no law at all applies to the environmental harms caused by defendants’ allegedly tortious activities.” In another brief in the San Francisco and Oakland case, a group of Democratic United States senators noted that fossil-fuel companies’ insistence that curbing climate change is the responsibility of the legislative and executive branches seemed to be in conflict with the same companies’ past efforts to prevent those branches from actually curbing emissions. “It becomes apparent,” the senators wrote, “that Defendants’ real position is that no one should address climate change, the cataclysmic effects it is already having and particularly the real injuries that Defendants have proximately caused.”
If courts are persuaded to allow any of the United States cases to follow Luciano Lliuya’s to the evidentiary phase and onward to a full hearing, they will still have to find satisfactory answers to a long list of difficult questions. Where on the chain of causality — from coal extraction to power generation, for example — does responsibility lie? How do we put a dollar amount on the degree of liability? How do we account for nonclimate variables, such as whether a city magnified its exposure to damages from wildfire or rising seas by permitting development in risky places? How should other contributors to climate change, from deforestation to population growth, be considered?
Defendants know they benefit from complicating the question of fault. They could theoretically seek to name co-defendants — the auto industry, perhaps, or chemical refineries or cement manufacturers — that they argue should shoulder or share in the blame. Chevron filed a third-party complaint to include Equinor, the Norwegian state oil company, as a fellow defendant in the cases brought by California cities and counties. And when New York City filed suit against BP and others, the companies responded that the city, because of its use of the oil industry’s products in its own police cars and garbage trucks and so on, shouldn’t be able to sue because it had what’s known as “unclean hands.” If everyone is at fault, the argument goes, no one can be held responsible — or, if courts decide they can be, it will create a legal free-for-all, “the war of everybody against everybody” that RWE’s spokesman described.
It might be good political theater to “name John and Jane Does One through Eight Billion,” says Michael Burger, the executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, who has written amicus briefs in support of the new suits. But if “companies are arguing that they, individually, are too small to be held legally responsible, it would be absurd to think that an individual human being would be responsible enough to haul into court.” Complicity is not the same as liability.
Proponents of lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies have studied the cases against tobacco companies carefully. For decades, the suits failed by the hundreds as tobacco companies argued that ultimate responsibility fell not on them but on the people who chose to use their products — an argument akin to oil companies contending that they can’t be held responsible for what comes out of consumers’ tail pipes. The tide began to turn against the tobacco industry once subpoenaed documents showed a longstanding conspiracy to cover up the harms of smoking. But the parallels aren’t perfect. Unlike tobacco, energy companies have argued, the existence of the fossil-fuel economy has provided considerable advantages to society. If we had understood the perils of climate change sooner, would we have stopped driving cars or using electricity from polluting sources? Most likely not, at least not on an individual level. So plaintiffs offer a different narrative: That companies actively prevented the development of alternative energy sources and the regulation of carbon-intensive ones, thus politically and economically propping up a polluting system. “It’s incorrect to say that there’s a strong public demand for fossil fuels,” Sher, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, told me. “What we have is a desire for energy.” In February, at a hearing in Rhode Island’s lawsuit against 21 oil and gas companies, Sher argued that “emissions magnify the harm, but the tort is the deception.”
Lawsuits themselves have sometimes led to novel attempts at untangling the Gordian knot of responsibility. Settling the tobacco lawsuits eventually involved attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories, more than $125 billion and dozens of companies — all but four of which asked to sign on after a settlement was reached. The Superfund law of 1980 imposes strict, retroactive liability on companies that create hazardous pollution and holds that any companies with even potential responsibility may be held liable for the entire cleanup of a site. Some observers imagine a future in which fossil-fuel companies support carbon regulation because it includes a provision shielding them from a morass of liability. Others point to disgorgement, a legal remedy most associated with securities fraud that compels surrendering profits gained through wrongful acts. Still other scenarios include companies’ offloading liability onto shell corporations or lawsuits continuing to lead nowhere, with climate change remaining a problem that is too large to litigate. Or the law may one day come to see things as straightforwardly as Luciano Lliuya does. “They have polluted,” he said, “and now there are consequences. They have to be responsible.”
One morning in Huaraz I woke up to the sound of tubas, part of an early celebration of carnival. People from the countryside streamed into the city, carrying enormous crosses decorated with leaves and flowers, and the streets filled with people dancing, food stalls selling fried guinea pigs and the cacophony of more brass bands than might reasonably be expected from the region’s population. As people swayed to the music, passing bottles of beer, the guardians of Lake Palcacocha were by the radio up at their cold hut, filing their latest report about the safety of the dancers below.
[How is climate change affecting your area? We want to hear from you.]
Luciano Lliuya also missed the day’s festivities. He was at a meeting in Llupa, the small village above Huaraz where he and Lidia raise their crops. The community was debating whether to share its water source with a neighboring village, whose drinking water, Luciano Lliuya explained, came from a stream that was becoming polluted. “The children have been getting sick,” he said. The water had become contaminated by another of climate change’s lesser-known impacts: what’s called acid rock drainage, which occurs when melting glaciers expose sulfur-bearing minerals to air and water, creating sulfuric acid. Like GLOFs, it’s only the beginning of the problems that the people of Peru will face as glaciers melt. The country has depended on consistent runoff from its rapidly disappearing ice to irrigate its fields, to run its power plants and to support the growth of Lima, a city of almost 10 million, in a desert. After a long debate, the people of Llupa agreed to share their water. It was impossible to say no to their neighbors, though they knew it would make the coming dry season even harder.
In Huaraz, above the street party, the sky darkened. Lightning flashed, but the thunder was inaudible over the noise of the crowd. The brass bands kept playing as the rain began to fall.",Local communities are taking the world's largest polluters to court.

"It was promising to be an uncharacteristically warm winter day in Boston. The temperature on Jan. 15, 1919, had soared to 40 degrees from 2 degrees earlier in the week, prompting many downtown workers to head outdoors.
Shortly after noon in the citys bustling North End, as Model T Fords chugged by and elevated trains screeched above Commercial Street, a group of firefighters sat down for a game of cards in a firehouse near a massive tank that stored molasses used in the production of industrial alcohol.
As the firefighters puzzled over their hands, they heard a strange staccato sound. The rivets on the 50-foot-high storage tank began to shoot off and a dull roar followed. At the noise, firefighter Paddy Driscoll whipped around. Oh my god! he exclaimed as he saw the dark torrent spilling out. Run!
The Great Molasses Flood was underway. The syrup swamped one of Bostons busiest neighborhoods, killing 21 and injuring 150.
Midday turned to darkness as the 2.3 million gallons of molasses engulfed the Boston waterfront like a black tidal wave, 25 feet high and 160 feet wide at the outset, Stephen Puleo recounted in his book Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919, which vividly captures details of the disaster, including the chilling reactions of Driscoll and others to the tank rupture.
Boston Police patrolman Frank McManus spotted the 26 million-pound wall of goop and shouted to the dispatcher, Send all available rescue vehicles and personnel immediately theres a wave of molasses coming down Commercial Street!
By now traveling at 35 mph, the wave of sugary doom tore through the North End with enough power to crumple small structures, blast a truck through a fence, knock the firehouse off its foundation and rip away a beam supporting the elevated train tracks.
Within seconds, two city blocks were inundated and the death toll began to climb.
[Two ships collided in Halifax Harbor. One of them was a floating, 3,000-ton bomb.]
City workers who were taking advantage of the warmth to eat lunch outside drowned where they sat. Two 10-year-olds who were collecting firewood near the molasses tank were swept away. Others suffocated as their homes and basements quickly filled.
I was in bed on the third floor of my house when I heard a deep rumble. I awoke in several feet of molasses, Martin Cloughtery told the Boston Globe in 1919. A pile of wreckage was holding me down, and a little way from me I saw my sister. I struggled out from under the wreckage and pulled my sister toward me and helped her on to a raft. I then began to look for my mother.
Even animals didnt escape.
A score of Public Works Department horses were either smothered in their stalls by the flood of molasses or so severely injured as their stable collapsed that they were shot by policemen to end their suffering, the Globe wrote in 1919.
Here and there struggled a form whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell, the Boston Post wrote. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was.
Scientific American magazine in 2013 explained why a wave of molasses can be much deadlier than a wave of water. The dense wall of syrup surging from its collapsed tank initially moved fast enough to sweep people up and demolish buildings, only to settle into a more gelatinous state that kept people trapped.
Rescuers and sailors from the USS Nantucket descended on the scene in droves, but struggled in the muck, which stained the waters of Boston Harbor brown for several days.
[With a blizzard raging, these rescuers set out on a doomed mission for an icebound island]
The search for survivors became a search for answers: Why did the tank rupture and were there signs beforehand?
The second part of that question was easily answered. During the summer of 1918, one of the hottest on record in Boston, North End residents began noticing leaks at the tank. After an employee reported a leak, the company acted by painting over the gray shell of the tank with a rust-brown color. The sticky liquid now blended, chameleon-like, with the fresh coat of paint, indiscernible from the tanks wall, Puleo wrote.
Litigation swiftly followed the explosion, and the lawsuit and trial against the tanks owner, U.S. Industrial Alcohol, would last six years and grow to one of the most exhaustive in the states history.
The trial produced three theories about the cause of the rupture: structural failure of the tank, fermentation of the molasses that led to an eruption and sabotage via a bomb. The company steadfastly blamed anarchists. A court-appointed auditor disagreed, and in 1925 ruled that the company was to blame for the disaster. U.S. Industrial Alcohol would later pay the flood victims and their families $628,000 the equivalent of $9.2 million today.
Today, studies have offered grim insight into why the tank collapsed. In a 2015 issue of Civil and Structural Engineer Magazine, engineer Ronald Mayville concluded that the walls of the tank were too thin, a flaw that builders at the time should have known. No one disputed they underdesigned the tank walls, he told the Boston Globe.
Back in the Boston of 1919, the city grieved as more bodies were found, some so battered and glazed by molasses that identification proved difficult. Four months later, the last body attributed to the flood was discovered under the wharf.
Boston is appalled at the terrible accident, Mayor Andrew J. Peters said in 1919. Over time, however, the Great Molasses Flood has become less of a catalyst for outrage and more of a quirky footnote in history.
The ood today remains part of the citys folklore, but not its heritage, Puleo wrote. The substance itself molasses gives the entire event an unusual, whimsical quality.
But for years after the flood, the memories of it resided not just in North Enders minds, but in their noses. The smell of molasses, journalist Edwards Park wrote in 1983, remained for decades a distinctive, unmistakable atmosphere of Boston.

"(Reuters) - U.S. solar installations fell 15 percent in the third quarter as the Trump administration’s tariffs on overseas-made panels forced developers to put off large projects, according to a report commissioned by the industry’s primary trade group. Current weakness in the utility-scale market, however, will be offset by larger volumes of projects than had been expected over the next five years because solar energy is now cheaper than ever, the report said. Quarterly installations of utility-scale solar were 678 megawatts, the lowest quarter since 2015 and a more than 30 percent decline from a year ago, the report by Wood Mackenzie for the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association said. The total market, which includes residential and commercial installations, came in at 1.7 gigawatts. The slowdown is a shift for solar, which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade. Through the first three quarters of the year, solar accounted for 30 percent of electricity generating capacity additions. Large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the 30 percent tariffs as panels can account for up to half their costs. Trump announced the levy on all imported solar panels in January, his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers rebound from years of decline. Solar installers opposed the move because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels. Most of the panels installed in the United States are made in Asia by companies including China’s JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd ( JKS.N ), Canadian Solar Inc ( CSIQ.O ), and U.S.-based SunPower Corp ( SPWR.O ). Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2018 utility-scale forecast to 6.6 GW from 6.8 GW as more projects get pushed into 2019. The firm raised its forecasts for 2019 through 2023 by a combined 2.5 GW, however, as utilities procure projects that will qualify for a federal tax credit that begins to phase out in 2020. Developers will start projects next year but delay buying modules until 2020 or later because the tariff drops by 5 percent each year. Sliding solar panel prices are also spurring demand from utilities. A move by China earlier this year to slash subsidies for solar installations has unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing down prices. Solar energy system prices are at historical lows in all segments of the market, the report said. U.S. module prices are down more than 15 percent from a year ago.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Thousands of Belgian schoolchildren skipped classes on Thursday to flood Brussels in an unprecedented protest against global warming and pollution, vowing to miss school once a week until the government takes action. 
Students banging drums and carrying signs decrying man-made climate change gathered around the European Parliament. 
Police said the 35,000-strong gathering was the biggest turnout of recent times for a student protest in the Belgian capital, which is also home to European Union institutions. 
“If we skip every Thursday, if we don’t go to school, the big people in our country and in the world will see that this is a problem,” said high school student Joppe Mathys. 
Another student held a sign saying: “Be part of the solution, not the pollution.” 
A nine-year-old girl, who gave her name only as Lalla and was with her teacher, said it was time people stopped driving cars and walked and cycled instead. 
“Dinosaurs thought they had time too,” read one banner. 
Brussels police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said the student demonstration was the biggest in recent memory. 
Broad protests started across Belgium on Dec. 2 with a “Claim the Climate” march, when over 65,000 demonstrators called for Belgian and European leaders to adopt ambitious climate policies in line with goals set by the Paris agreement in 2015. 
That demonstration came before the COP24 U.N. climate summit in Poland, where a report was released ranking Belgium 31 out of 60 on the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index, or a “medium” performance in implementing the Paris agreements. 
Brussels has been regularly ranked as one of the most congested cities in western Europe in recent years due to Belgium’s high population density and large number of commuters. 
That is also a mark of shame for a capital where the EU sets European climate policies. 
Across the EU, road congestion costs the bloc one percent of its annual economic output, or 100 billion euros ($113.70 billion) per year, according to the European Commission.

"(Reuters) - Australia’s Incitec Pivot Ltd said on Monday it would face a weekly loss due to the closure of a rail line connecting the flood-hit city of Townsville in northern Queensland and its fertilizer plant. 
The industrial explosives maker said the rail closure would see about A$10 million ($7.08 million) a week wiped off its earnings before interest and tax from Feb. 9 until production can resume. 
The company, over the weekend, started to shut down plants within its ammonium phosphate Phosphate Hill facility, it added in a statement. 
The northeastern state of Queensland was the scene of severe flooding last week, which forced thousands of people to evacuate after authorities opened up dam gates as torrential rains filled reservoirs to overflowing. 
Incitec said its Phosphate Hill facility had not sustained any damage from the flooding, but added that its Townsville fertilizer distribution and port facilities experienced minor damage but were operational. 
Townsville, a major port for northern Australia, is the country’s top exporter of copper, zinc, lead and sugar.

"MALVERN, Iowa (Reuters) - The Black Hawk military helicopter flew over Iowa, giving a senior U.S. agriculture official and U.S. senator an eyeful of the flood damage below, where yellow corn from ruptured metal silos spilled out into the muddy water. 
And there’s nothing the U.S. government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops here under current laws or disaster-aid programs, U.S. Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey told a Reuters reporter who joined the flight. 
The USDA has no mechanism to compensate farmers for damaged crops in storage, Northey said, a problem never before seen on this scale. That’s in part because U.S. farmers have never stored so much of their harvests, after years of oversupplied markets, low prices and the latest blow of lost sales from the U.S. trade war with China - previously their biggest buyer of soybean exports. 
The USDA last year made $12 billion in aid available to farmers who suffered trade-war losses, without needing Congressional approval. The agency has separate programs that partially cover losses from cattle killed in natural disasters, compensate farmers who cannot plant crops due to weather, and help them remove debris left in fields after floods. 
But it has no program to cover the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored-crop losses from the widespread flooding, triggered by the “bomb cyclone” that hit the region in mid-March. Congress would have to pass legislation to address the harvests lost in the storm, according to Northey and a USDA statement to Reuters. 
“It’s not traditionally been covered,” he said. “But we’ve not usually had as many losses.” 
Indigo Ag, an agriculture technology company, identified 832 on-farm storage bins within flooded Midwest areas. They hold an estimated 5 million to 10 million bushels of corn and soybeans - worth between $17.3 million to $34.6 million - that could have been damaged in the floods, the company told Reuters. 
Across the United States, farmers held soybean stocks of 2.716 billion bushels as of March 1, the largest on record for the time period, the USDA said on Friday. Corn stocks were the third-largest on record. 
Some Congress members have expressed interest in pursuing legislation to provide aid for damaged crops in storage, Northey said. But passing legislation could require a lengthy political process in the face of an urgent disaster, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley told farmers at a meeting in Malvern, Iowa. 
“If we have to pass a bill to do it, I hate to tell you how long that takes,” said the senator from Iowa, who joined Northey on the helicopter tour. 
With farm incomes declining for years before the flood, many farmers had planned to sell their grain in storage for money to live, pay their taxes or finance operations, including planting this spring. 
THROWING AWAY CROPS 
From the helicopter, piloted by National Guard members, officials surveyed miles of flooded fields in Iowa, littered with lawn chairs, fuel tanks, furniture, tires and other flood debris. 
Farmers will have to destroy any grains that were contaminated by floodwater, which could also prevent some growers from planting oversaturated fields. 
Near Crescent, Iowa, farmer Don Rief said the flood damaged more than 60,000 bushels of his grain, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He tried to move the crops before the flood, but dirt roads were too soft from the storm to support trucks. 
“We were just hurrying like hell,” Rief said. “Hopefully USDA will come in and minimize some of the damage.” 
The USDA does not have a program that covers flood-damaged grain because farmers have typically received more advance notice of rising waters, allowing them to move crops and limit losses, said Tom Vilsack, who ran the agency under former President Barack Obama. 
In this case, floods inundated fields quickly after multiple levees failed when rain and melting snow filled the Missouri River and other waterways. The frozen ground was unable to soak up the water. 
Near Percival, Iowa, railroad tracks leading up to a grain facility were flooded and broken. A Deere &amp; Co dealership, Wendy’s restaurant, Motel 6 and gas station nearby were also underwater, along with homes, cars and farm equipment. 
Some farmers moved machinery such as tractors on to highways to keep it out of the path of the floods. The equipment was still parked there during the flyover on Friday. 
DISASTER RELIEF ‘GAP’ 
About 416,000 acres of cropland across six counties in Iowa were flooded, said Amanda De Jong, state executive director for the USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency. 
Of that, about 309,000 acres will be eligible for the federal program that helps farmers and ranchers remove debris left by natural disasters on farmlands, De Jong said last week. She estimated the program would need about $34 million to clean up the fields. 
Iowa’s agriculture secretary Mike Naig said the U.S. government also should help compensate farmers for some of the grain that was damaged. 
“This is clearly a gap that we think needs to be addressed,” said Naig, who accompanied Grassley and Northey in the chopper. 
Time is short for a solution, said Carol Vinton, supervisor of Mills County, Iowa, one of the state’s two most heavily damaged counties. 
Vinton said she was getting calls from farmers whose grain was damaged and are worried about making good on previously signed contracts to deliver those crops to elevators. 
The USDA wants to do everything it can to help farmers hurt by the disaster, Northey said. 
“They spent all last year raising that crop, putting it in the bin and they maybe already have it marketed,” he said. “And now they’re going to have to spend time just to get rid of it - just to clean the place up.”

"(Reuters) - Four low-lying communities along a swollen river in Northern California wine country remained cut off by floodwaters on Thursday, even as the river receded and sun peeked through after days of non-stop rain, officials said. 
With water rising to rooftops and submerging cars as the Russian River burst its banks, authorities in Sonoma County, about 70 miles (100 km) north of San Francisco, ordered 3,600 people to evacuate on Tuesday. 
Some people who stayed used kayaks to traverse flooded streets. By Thursday, National Guard troops, along with state and local responders, had used high water vehicles to rescue nearly 60 people, Sonoma County officials said. 
A National Weather Service (NWS) flood warning remained in effect for the rain-soaked area on Thursday and at least 20 roads in the Russian River valley, including sections of two highways, were still closed, authorities said. 
Three thousand properties in the area have reported flood damage to authorities, according to local officials. 
The towns of Rio Nido, Guerneville, Monte Rio and Cazadero are still completely inaccessible, according to the Sonoma County emergency operations center. 
And with the sun breaking through, authorities face a new problem - keeping people safe as they try to return home, said Ann DuBay, a spokeswoman for the operations center. 
“It’s still in flood stage, it’s still very dangerous out there,” DuBay said, adding that authorities do not know when the four communities will become accessible. 
Guerneville, home to more than 4,500 people, is the largest town in the area still cut off. 
“You cannot get into or out of town. All roads leading to the community are flooded,” Sonoma County Sheriff’s office tweeted on Wednesday, referring to Guerneville. 
The Russian River reached its highest point late on Wednesday, cresting at 45 ft (13.7 m). The river was expected to drop below flood levels early on Friday and then fall by another 15 ft (4.6 m), said NWS hydrologist Peter Fickenscher. 
The service predicts more rain will fall late on Friday, but it is not expected to cause further flooding.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will aim to achieve “a good start” in the first quarter for the economy, the state planner said on Tuesday, signaling authorities could roll out more stimulus measures in the near term to counter slowing growth. 
China will strengthen monitoring of its economic situation and improve its “reserve” of economic policies, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement. 
The world’s second-biggest economy slowed in 2018 as Chinese authorities carried out painful long-term structural adjustments to transition to a more gradual but sustainable growth trajectory. 
A trade war with the United States has also heaped uncertainty on China’s near-term outlook. Exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December in a sign of mounting pressure on the economy. 
Premier Li Keqiang said China achieved its key 2018 economic targets, which were “hard-worn”, and seeks a strong start to the economy in the first quarter to establish conditions helpful to meeting this year’s goals, according to state television on Monday. 
Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6-6.5 percent this year after an expected 6.6 percent in 2018, the slowest pace in 28 years. 
The proposed target, to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in March, was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in mid-December, the sources told Reuters. 
Annual growth of about 6.2 percent is needed this year and in 2020 to meet the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020, and to turn China into a “modestly prosperous” nation. 
China has lowered the level of reserves that commercial banks need to set aside for the fifth time in a year, to spur lending, particularly to small and medium-sized firms. Beijing has also cut taxes and fees, and stepped up infrastructure investment to shore up the economy. 
This year, China will step up fiscal expenditure and implement larger tax and fee cuts. The cuts will focus on reducing burdens for small firms and manufacturers, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Stabilizing employment is the government’s top priority, NDRC Vice Chairman Lian Weiliang said at a press conference on Tuesday. 
NO FLOOD OF STIMULUS 
China will speed up investment projects and local government bond issuances, but will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus, Lian said. 
The central bank, in a separate statement, said it will maintain prudent monetary policy, keeping it neither too tight nor too loose, and strengthen the counter-cyclical adjustments. 
Monetary policy will be made more forward-looking, flexible and targeted, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said. 
A prudent monetary policy does not mean that there will be no changes, PBOC Deputy Governor Zhu Hexin said at the press conference. 
When asked if the PBOC should cut benchmark interest rates, Zhu said existing monetary policy measures should be improved. 
A few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility, but most expect Beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past, due to worries that it could add to a mountain of debt and weaken the yuan. 
“Both fiscal and monetary policy have been loosened over the past few months and this should start to feed through to the real economy by the second half of this year,” analysts at Capital Economics said in a note. 
“However, the scale of the stimulus so far has been more limited than in 2015-16, and the effect on activity is likely to be correspondingly smaller.” 
Chinese banks extended 16.17 trillion yuan ($2.40 trillion) in net new yuan loans last year, the PBOC said in its statement, blowing past the previous record of 13.53 trillion yuan in 2017. 
Outstanding yuan loans were up 13.5 percent at the end of 2018 from a year earlier, according to the central bank.

"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine government ministers met with a top adviser of Japan’s prime minister on Wednesday, in a effort to move forward major infrastructure projects, just hours after a visit by the Chinese president pledging to do the same. Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte has made a $180 billion infrastructure overhaul the centerpiece of his economic policy agenda, but already into the third year of his presidency, he is under some pressure to show signs that his ambitious “Build, Build, Build” program is making much progress. While attention has been focused largely on fanfare of Duterte’s “pivot” to China and his frequent praise for Beijing’s economic support, agreed Japanese loans so far dwarf those of China, which has pledged billions of dollars of financing and investment for projects that are still largely ideas. Japan will finance 156.4 billion yen ($1.39 billion) for the construction of a subway in the capital Manila, rehabilitation of one of its troubled elevated rail lines, a new Manila bypass road and a new airport on Bohol, a tourist island. The loans are part of an 1 trillion yen aid and investment package offered in 2017 by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose special advisor, Hiroto Izumi, is in Manila to discuss revamping a railroad across the capital, a flood control system, and jointly operating an industrial zone, Finance assistant secretary Antonio Lambino told Reuters. Edmund Tayao, a Manila-based political analyst, said the strong performance of the Philippine economy meant it had outgrown its infrastructure, and there was public pressure to modernize it. “This is a long-delayed requisite,” he said. “When we speak of trains, mass transit systems, disappointment is an understatement. It is frustrating to compare it with neighbors.” Expectations have been high since Duterte left China two years ago with $24 billion of investment and loans pledges, and there were hopes that this week’s visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first in 13 years, would have seen firm commitments for those to advance.

In last Thursday’s attack, the deadliest in 16 years, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV carrying about 80 kilograms (176 lbs) of high explosive pentolite, broke through checkpoints onto the grounds of the General Santander School in the capital before it detonated, also damaging hundreds of apartments nearby. 
Colombia’s National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group has been blamed for the attack, prompting Duque to request Havana capture and extradite 10 rebel commanders in Cuba for peace talks. 
The driver of the car, ELN explosives expert Jose Aldemar Rojas, was also killed in the blast, authorities said. 
On Sunday, police officers lined the streets emotionally overwhelmed by the flood of support for their fallen comrades, cadets between 18 and 23 years old. 
“It fills my heart to see so many marching and supporting us,” said a tearful Javier Sosa, dressed in olive green uniform. 
Nuns holding white daisies and handkerchiefs marched alongside police singing “a united Colombia will never be defeated.” 
The bombing has heightened fears that a new wave of attacks had been launched in the Andean nation as a reaction to the right-wing president’s stance. 
Duque, who took office in August, pledged during his election campaign to toughen the fight against the group and drug-trafficking crime gangs that kill and kidnap civilians. 
“This is a symbol of patriotism, public spirit and union,” Duque told Reuters as he marched. 
“Today we’re here as ordinary citizens to reject terrorism and violence. We’re honoring the memory of those heroes, of those boys who were vilely murdered.” 
The ELN, formed by radical Catholic priests in 1964, has not claimed responsibility or issued a public statement, but Duque’s demand to arrest its peace negotiators makes it almost impossible for talks to restart. 
Cuba has sidestepped Duque’s request and said it will abide by the rules set out before talks began. 
The negotiation protocols provide security guarantees for guerrilla leaders to return to Colombia and protection from military attacks for an agreed period. 
Composed of some 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, the ELN began peace talks with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos in early 2017, but they were suspended by Duque until the group frees its hostages and stops attacks. 
The latest incident was the deadliest car bomb attack since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) attacked Bogota’s upmarket El Nogal social club in 2003, killing 36. 
Car bombs were frequently used during decades of civil war but the worst of the violence, which killed some 260,000, ended in 2016 when peace was signed with FARC.

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Rival campaigners in Indonesia’s elections next month are sparring over ways to fix the education system in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, which is widely blamed for failing to equip students with the skills to find jobs. 
As a flood of young people enters the workforce, President Joko Widodo, who seeks re-election on April 17, has pledged to develop human capital in his second term, after focusing on roads, railways and airports since taking office in 2014. 
In a vice presidential debate this week, partly focused on education, opposition candidate Sandiaga Uno attacked Widodo’s record and his signature program to improve one of the world’s biggest vocational high school systems. 
“How ironic it is that this country’s economy is the world’s 15th or 16th biggest, but faces difficulties providing jobs for its youth,” Uno said, adding that Indonesia’s vocational school graduates are the largest chunk of its 7 million unemployed. 
Uno, who is running alongside retired general Prabowo Subianto, promised to cut youth unemployment by 2 million if elected. 
Widodo and his running mate, cleric Ma’ruf Amin, have a double-digit lead in most opinion polls, but education could prove a weakness. 
Indonesia should be enjoying a demographic sweet spot with its youthful population, but 90 percent of its labor force of 131 million have no college degree and more than half works in informal sectors. 
The World Bank said more than 55 percent of citizens who complete education are functionally illiterate, far more than 14 percent in neighboring Vietnam, which has been more successful in wooing manufacturers moving out of China. 
The OECD ranks Indonesia’s education system 62nd among the 72 nations in its Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) that rates 15-year-olds’ maths, science and reading skills. Neighboring Vietnam placed 8th. 
Pledging to emulate Germany’s skills training system, Widodo’s government wants to spend $1.22 billion in 2019 on improvements to 14,000 vocational schools which have 320,000 students, or more than double the past three years’ spending. 
Vocational schools have failed to keep pace and offer the skills employers want, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of Indonesia’s employers’ association. 
“Once we hire people, they always have to be retrained.” 
A joint assessment by the government and the World Bank revealed shortages of skills in managerial positions, from chemical manufacturing to biochemistry and food technology. 
At one of Jakarta’s best vocational schools, deputy head Handayani said it was tough to keep pace with technology. 
While a course on office management that replaced secretarial training taught use of a fax and even a typewriter, there were no courses on artificial intelligence or automation, she added. 
During Sunday’s debate, the 76-year-old Amin defended the government’s program to produce a skilled workforce. 
He touted a plan for skills training and cash handouts to the unemployed, but some economists have warned that could stretch the budget. 
Uno, a businessman and former deputy governor of Jakarta, said he would push training for entrepreneurs and boost teachers’ salaries if elected. 
Experts point to the looming demographic challenges. 
“Like it or not, this population is growing older and before it turns old, people have to be made more productive,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said this month.

"LIMA (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Peru have opened a preliminary probe into the mayor of an Andean city who promised to “free” his city of Venezuelan immigrants and force companies to hire more locals, the attorney general’s office said on Monday. 
The investigation will seek to determine if Henry Lopez, the mayor of Huancayo - a commercial hub of about 500,000 people in Peru’s central highlands - committed discrimination and incitement to discrimination, the office said on Twitter. 
Peru’s constitution bans discrimination on the basis of origin, race, sex, language, religion, opinion or economic status. 
Lopez was not immediately available for comment but one of his advisors said by telephone that prosecutors cannot start an investigation for comments that were “taken out of context.” 
In a statement published by his office on Wednesday, Lopez blamed Venezuelans for what he claimed was a spike in crime and street hawking in Huancayo, and promised to pass a municipal ordinance requiring companies to ensure locals made up at least 80 percent of their workforce. 
He also suggested a Venezuelan immigrant who had been working as a security guard plotted to kill a local man whose death is still under investigation. 
“I was elected to bring order to the city. They’ll call me xenophobic but I don’t mind,” Lopez said in the statement. “Today I declare ‘Huancayo free of Venezuelans.’” 
Lopez’ comments are part of a recent flare-up in xenophobia in South America since a flood of poor and desperate Venezuelan migrants entered the region in recent years, fleeing an acute economic and political crisis under President Nicolas Maduro. 
Peru has been one of the most welcoming countries for Venezuelan immigrants, granting them special residency cards that allow them to work and access public healthcare as well as education services. 
The Andean nation is now home to 700,000 Venezuelans, the largest population of Venezuelan immigrants outside of Colombia, which shares a border with Venezuela. 
But the government of President Martin Vizcarra tightened entry requirements for Venezuelans last year. 
Earlier on Monday, Peru Foreign Minister Nestor Popolizio said the government was now evaluating whether to require Venezuelans to obtain a “humanitarian visa” from its consulate in Caracas before migrating, similar to a measure Chile implemented that has made it harder for Venezuelans to enter the country legally. 
“Venezuelan migration has impacted the labor market and our health and education systems. It’s a reality that our country’s capabilities are overwhelmed,” Popolizio told lawmakers in televised comments. 
Still, Lopez’ comments triggered a wave of criticism in Peru last week, including condemnation from the culture ministry, which deemed them “unacceptable in a democratic state that respects fundamental rights.” 
Supporters of Lopez’ position say Peru, where about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty, should help its poorer citizens before Venezuelan migrants. 
Last year, a candidate for mayor of Lima, Ricardo Belmont, stoked fears that Venezuelans were a threat to Peruvians’ jobs and to public order. Belmont lost the election, coming in sixth.

"(Reuters) - The collapse of a Brazilian tailings dam owned by Vale SA on Jan. 25 ranks among the worst mining disasters in decades. 
More than 300 people are feared dead after the dam failure near the town of Brumadinho released a torrent of mining waste into Vale’s facilities and a nearby community in Minas Gerais state. 
The IndustriALL union, which represents mining and energy workers globally, said the Brazilian dam disaster is already recognized as the most deadly labor accident in the history of Brazil. 
It follows on from the country’s worst environmental incident in November 2015 when the collapse of the Samarco dam, operated by Vale and BHP, resulted in the death of 19 people.

"XINZO DE LIMIA, Spain (Reuters) - Until January, Jose Martinez and his wife Arelis Morales were in the eye of Venezuela’s political storm: he worked for an opposition leader, she advised human rights groups. 
But after years of opposing President Nicolas Maduro’s increasingly repressive leftist government - including 2017 protests that ended with 125 deaths - they decided to put family life first. 
“The main reason for leaving was that we want to have children,” Martinez, 31, told Reuters, from the rural town of Xinzo de Limia in Spain’s Galicia region where they left to live with relatives. 
“It hurts, but we have to move on. How could we expose a child to everything that goes on in Venezuela?” 
The exodus of more than 3 million Venezuelans from an imploding economy, crime-ridden streets and constant political violence, is a well-known phenomenon, especially the flood of lower-income migrants around Latin America. 
There has been less attention paid to middle-class professionals who, though enjoying more resources, also face agonizing dilemmas, often giving up years of training and work. 
Martinez, a coordinator in the party of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, suffered depression last year. But he is recovering in Xinzo de Limia and reinventing himself as a photographer, doing documentary and wedding work. 
His wife Morales, 30, wants to stay working in human rights, while seeking to have a baby. “We gave everything we could for the country until my body literally said: ‘I cannot take this anymore’,” she said, saying stress stopped her getting pregnant. 
Both are encouraged by recent events in Venezuela, where congress leader Juan Guaido invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency after declaring Maduro’s 2018 reelection illegitimate, galvanizing the opposition and earning Western recognition. 
The couple hope to move back if Maduro loses power. 
PROFESSIONAL DREAM 
Thousands of Venezuelans have moved to Spain in recent years, many reconnecting with roots after waves of immigration in the opposite direction following the 20th century World Wars. 
According to official data, Venezuelans living in Spain rose to 109,880 by mid-2018, up nearly 19,000 in the previous six months. Those figures probably do not include many dual nationality citizens who also moved, people like Mariana Elias. 
Before moving to Barcelona in January, Elias spent years in Caracas doing two degrees in chemical and production engineering, helping to pay her way with work as a teacher. 
She protested on the streets against Maduro, was faculty student council president at Simon Bolivar university, and felt the chaos of Caracas close up when robbed on three occasions. 
Her reason for moving to Barcelona was straightforward: “My job ambitions. As I really prepared myself academically, I wanted to have the opportunity in the long-term to progress and upgrade. I wasn’t able to see that in Venezuela right now.” 
Elias, 27, wants to find a job in engineering, but for now has started at a British company organizing conferences. In Spain she enjoys basic services such as public transport that her compatriots can no longer take for granted. 
“In Venezuela I would never take public transport unless I had no other choice. I would pray and ask all the deities to make me invisible so I wouldn’t get robbed,” said the bubbly, bilingual Elias, adding she had no plans to return home any time soon. 
She enjoys Venezuelan traditions with compatriots in Spain. 
“The Venezuelans I know are all trying to work and make ends meet. But we meet up to talk about our country and to eat ‘arepas’,” she said, referring to the cornmeal flatbread staple. 
“I am not able to leave Venezuela out of my mind, never.”

"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran evacuated residents from inundated areas of the southwestern city of Ahvaz on Wednesday as the nationwide death toll from the worst flooding in 70 years reached 77, state media reported. 
The state news agency IRNA said more than 200 villages were also evacuated in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, and 46,000 people were housed in emergency shelters provided by the government. 
Further districts of Ahvaz were put on flood alert, the provincial governor said, as more torrential rain was forecast in coming days. A hospital in the city was evacuated on Monday. 
Floods described by officials as the worst since the 1940s have hit some 1,900 cities and villages across Iran after exceptionally heavy rain since March 19. Western and southwestern areas of the country are suffering the worst. 
The disaster has left aid agencies struggling to cope, and the armed forces were deployed to help flood-hit people. 
Early estimates put flood losses in agriculture sector at 47 trillion rials ($350 million). 
The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. The Islamic Republic’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved Iranian oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad. 
Iranian officials have repeatedly said the massive floods have not affected production and development of oilfields, or the flow of crude through pipelines to recipient markets.

"DALLAS Another senior employee at a chemical company is facing criminal charges connected to a 2017 explosion at a Houston-area plant following Hurricane Harvey.
Michael Keough, vice president of logistics for Arkema Inc.'s North American subsidiary, was indicted for felony assault over his actions ahead of a chemical fire and explosion at the company's Crosby facility, the Harris County District Attorney's office announced Wednesday. The company was also charged.
Keough falsely told officials that Arkema was monitoring potentially explosive chemical tanks in real time when the company had insufficient data to give early warning, according to District Attorney Kim Ogg. These ""misrepresentations"" led two sheriff's deputies to drive directly into a toxic cloud, which then spread to exposing others, she said.
An attorney for Keough, Dan Cogdell, called the indictment ""absurd"" and ""beyond rational thought.""
""There has, quite literally, never been a prosecution like this one for one singular reason — what Mike did wasn't a crime"" Cogdell said in a statement.
The charges against Keough were announced weeks after fires at two other Houston-area chemical plants , and on the day President Donald Trump visited Crosby to sign executive orders designed to speed up oil and gas pipeline projects
Ogg acknowledged during a press conference that criminal charges are rarely brought against company employees over environmental violations, but said civil regulations have proven insufficient to protect the public.
""Too often corporations are simply allowed to pay fines and that doesn't change corporate behavior,"" she said.
Keough is the third Arkema employee to be indicted since the hurricane knocked out power at the company's Crosby facility. Without electricity, some of the chemicals at the plant caught fire and partially exploded, sending plumes of smoke skyward.
Richard Rowe, the France-based company's chief executive, and plant manager Leslie Comardelle were charged with releasing toxic chemicals last year. They are set to be tried in May.
In 2018, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board released a report saying that Arkema failed to consider how a Harvey-level flood could affect its electrical power system.
A lawyer for the company, Rusty Hardin, said Wednesday that prosecutors are trying to hold Arkema responsible for an ""Act of God"" and called the case ""political.""",Employee charged with assault in Texas plant explosion Fox News Harris County DA announces new indictments for Arkema and its VP of Logistics KTRK-TV Another Arkema official indicted in chemical release during Harvey KPRC Click2Houston Texas chemical plant em…,2019-04-10T19:17:34Z,Employee charged with assault in Texas plant explosion - Fox News,Fox News,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission voted on Wednesday to clarify that wireless carriers have the authority to block unwanted or spam text messages, but Democrats warned the decision would allow carriers to block or censor texts that customers send. The FCC voted 3-to-1 to classify text messages as an information service rather than a telecommunications service, which it said would have limited the ability of wireless carriers to combat robotexts and spam messages. The FCC said text messages have become a trusted form of communication as wireless providers like AT&amp;T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Sprint Corp successfully eliminated most spam texts. In 2017, 1.77 trillion text messages were exchanged in the United States. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission’s decision would allow wireless providers “to continue taking action against unwanted text messages.” But FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the vote means “you no longer have the final say on where your text messages go and what they said. That means your carrier now has the legal right to block your text messages and censor the very content of your messages.” The FCC said the decision addressed bulk messaging and did not affect individuals sending messages or blocking specific senders. Pai said “the FCC shouldn’t make it easier for spammers and scammers to bombard consumers with unwanted texts. And we shouldn’t allow unwanted messages to plague wireless messaging services in the same way that unwanted robocalls flood voice services.” The declaration was prompted after Twilio Inc, which sends texts for companies, in 2015 asked the FCC to declare that text messages are “telecommunications services.” Twilio asked the FCC for the declaration to prohibit what it said was wireless providers’ “unfettered” blocking of text messages. Public Knowledge, an advocacy group, said carriers could discriminate against text fundraising campaigns or by political campaigns and marketing firms. The group argues the action “undermines the public’s right to use text messaging without undue interference from wireless companies.” Last week, nine Democratic U.S. senators said the vote would “stifle free speech” and cited Verizon’s 2007 decision to briefly block mass text messages from a group supporting abortion rights before reversing itself. CTIA, a wireless industry trade group, praised the FCC “for protecting consumers from an avalanche of messaging spam and allowing them to continue to benefit from a flourishing and competitive messaging ecosystem.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe","The Federal Communications Commission voted on Wednesday to clarify that wireless carriers have the authority to block unwanted or spam text messages, but Democrats warned the decision would allow carriers to block or censor texts that customers send.",2018-12-12T18:05:52Z,FCC affirms that wireless carriers can block unwanted text messages,Reuters,0

"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions have prevented the Iranian Red Crescent from obtaining any foreign financial aid to assist victims of flooding that has killed at least 70 people and inundated some 1,900 communities, the group said on Sunday. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Washington was ready to help via the Red Cross and Red Crescent, but accused Iran’s clerical establishment of “mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness”. 
“No foreign cash help has been given to the Iranian Red Crescent society. With attention to the inhuman American sanctions, there is no way to send this cash assistance,” the Red Crescent said in a statement. 
It said the group had received some non-financial help from abroad which had been distributed to flood victims. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said last week that U.S. sanctions - reimposed after Washington quit a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers - were impeding aid efforts to flood-stricken towns and villages. 
“Blocked equipment includes relief choppers: This isn’t just economic warfare; it’s economic TERRORISM,” he said on Twitter. 
The flood disaster, arising from exceptionally heavy rainfall since March 19, has left aid agencies struggling to cope and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters. 
The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. 
Iran’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved its oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad. 
Iran acted on Saturday to evacuate more towns and villages threatened by floods after continued rain in the southwest.

"Chicago — R. Kelly has posted bail after spending the weekend in a Chicago jail on sex abuse charges, authorities said Monday. Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari told CBS News around 4 p.m. CT he was expected to be released within the hour.
Kelly, one of the best-selling music artists of all-time, was arrested late Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were minors. A judge on Saturday set bond at $1 million, requiring the Grammy Award-winning singer to pay 10 percent to be released. 
At a court hearing Monday, Kelly's case was assigned to Cook County Associate Judge Lawrence Flood, who will preside over the trial. Kelly clasped his hands behind his back and was not handcuffed during the five-minute hearing. Defense attorney Steve Greenberg said Kelly would enter a plea of not guilty and waived a formal reading of charges.

"Such a change wouldnt stem the flood of outside money deforming the political system, but it would give candidates an alternative way to run and provide not-so-rich Americans a greater sense that their voices can be heard. It is the foundation on which other anti-corruption efforts rest, reformers say, with a warning that if lawmakers dont address this problem, their credibility will remain in the toilet.
The data suggest that the public has an appetite for taking on campaign finance. A Pew Research poll from May found that 77 percent of Americans favor limits on the amount of money individuals and organizations can spend on campaigns. (This includes 71 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.) Sixty-five percent believe that new laws could effectively reduce the influence of money in politics.
At this point, the hunger for reform is so fierce among the Democratic base that the caucus will need to work to temper expectations. While H.R. 1 is near the top of incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosis to-do list, the package will take a while to make its way to a floor vote. At least five committees have oversight of pieces of it, and even among Democrats there are competing visions for various provisions that must be worked through. Democratic House leaders are hoping to get a bill passed early in the year. And then it is likely to go nowhere fast.
One reason H.R. 1 can be so big and bold is that it is mostly an expression of what Democrats would like to do rather than what has any real shot at moving through this divided government. Even staunch fans of the measure expect the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to jam it up in the Senate. The phlegmatic Mr. McConnell may not get worked up about much, but over the years he has consistently displayed a fierce passion for strangling anything resembling campaign finance reform.
The package could prove awkward for Republican members in other areas as well. For instance, measures to make voting easier might be a hard sell in a party that appears to have so vigorously committed to curtailing voter access.
Realistically speaking, enacting even pieces of a bill like H.R. 1 is more of a medium- to longish-term legislative goal. But this does not diminish the urgency of passing the package in the House as a declaration of Democrats commitment. Its champions seem to grasp this. Mr. Sarbanes expressed optimism that serious revisions could be achieved within a couple of election cycles but only if Democrats move quickly to get people fired up and then keep the pressure on.
Even the most ethically bankrupt politician can spout drivel about draining the swamp. For the next couple of years, Democrats challenge is to keep this issue hot enough to make life uncomfortable for reform foes like Mr. McConnell and to make clear to voters what must be done if they want to take this crusade beyond one chamber of Congress.

"Just three weeks after one of the most intense storms on record pounded the Plains and Midwest, another ""bomb cyclone"" of similar strength is in the forecast. The spring storm seems poised to dump even heavier snow and could be followed by another round of significant river flooding.
For the past few days, various forecast computer models have shown a blizzard of epic proportions for the north-central Plain States and Upper Midwest. Every time a model is updated, the storm depicted seems to get even more intense. At this point, it seems likely that some of the same areas impacted by devastating flooding just weeks ago are about to get slammed by an historic blizzard Wednesday through Friday.
As of Sunday night, the storm system was located in the eastern Pacific Ocean and was moving onshore along the U.S. West Coast.

Early this week, the system will move across the Rockies and bring heavy snow to the mountains of Wyoming and Colorado. The storm will intensify as it enters the central Great Plains on Wednesday. The barometric pressure — a measure of intensity in which lower means stronger — may drop to levels nearly as low as during the record-setting bomb cyclone in mid-March. In fact, this storm could tie or set April low pressure records.

As the storm strengthens, it will drag thick Gulf of Mexico moisture northward on a collision course with below freezing temperatures north of the system. It's forecast to slow down at that point and perhaps even stall for 24 hours. That would mean a prolonged period of blinding heavy snow, wind gusts to 70 mph and near zero visibility in Nebraska, South Dakota, northern Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin from Wednesday through Friday.
The latest computer models put the bullseye for the heaviest snow band from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, through Minneapolis east to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Snow totals could be staggering, with some models showing more than 30 inches in some areas.
Models are amazingly similar in forecast snowfall - European, Canadian and FV3 (not pictured here) have bullseyes of 30-40 inches.

While not out of the question, snowfall of more than 30 inches is implausible at any time, but especially this late in the season. That's because in milder spring air, snow tends to be heavier, wetter and more compacted. Still, a narrow band of two feet seems well within reach.
For the sake of comparison, Minneapolis' biggest snowfall was the Halloween Blizzard of 1991, when 28 inches piled up. The second biggest snowfall there was 21 inches in November 1985.
It wasn't a coincidence that the two heaviest snows weren't in the middle of winter. That's because during mid-winter, the atmosphere is often too cold and dry in the Upper Midwest to support the most substantial snowfalls. In fact, 15 of the 20 biggest snow totals happened outside of the dead of winter. But in autumn and spring, the atmosphere is loaded with more moisture, lending more credibility to the possibility of the forecast spring blockbuster topping the charts.
Regardless of snowfall amounts, it seems certain that copious amounts of water will be squeezed out of the air - a liquid equivalent of two to four inches. Once the snow melts starting this weekend, the water would run off into already flooded rivers in the High Plains and Midwest.
As of Sunday night, dozens of gauges along the Mississippi, Big Sioux and James rivers were in major or moderate flood stage. Flooding has mostly receded along the Missouri River.
Across the nation 34 river gauges are in major flood stage, 55 in moderate and many of those are in the Midwest.

"More than 10 inches of snow were dumped on Lubbock, Texas, as an intense winter storm slammed the state and moved toward the Southeast, threatening millions in its path. The same storm dumped heavy rains on Los Angeles earlier in the week. The storm tore through Texas, dumping snow and unseasonal heavy rain, CBS News' Janet Shamlian reports. Travel grinded to a near-standstill as plows and tow trucks became a lifeline for those caught off guard. Overnight, heavy rains hammered Houston. Roads and highways turned into fast-moving streams as sewers backed up and overflowed. First responders used a high-water rescue truck to help these drivers after they stalled on a flooded city street. With the warnings widespread, many taking no chances. ""Getting candles for sure, batteries for flashlights and headlamps,"" said Stephanie Cantu. ""I already have my propane stove ready just in case."" Around 1,724 were without power in Texas as of Saturday afternoon. There were 10,195 total flight delays reported, according to FlightAware, and 809 cancellations. In Houston, the Harris County Flood Control District said major flooding is expected at, near and east of Highway 59. The flooding is expected to impact the Belleau Woods, Forest Cove, Northshore and Riverside Crest subdivisions, CBS Houston affiliate KHOU reports. Officials told KHOU the elevated structures in these areas could be cut off for several days. The river is expected to rise to threshold levels by Saturday afternoon and reach its peak crest Monday evening. It is forecasted to remain above flood stage into Wednesday, and officials say some residents may be cut off for 4 to 5 days. The high water that swamped roads and bayous in Houston is already draining away, but the system is now targeting the Carolinas with snow and bitter cold. Governors in Virginia and North Carolina already declared emergencies. Up to 18 inches of snow could fall in the Carolina mountains. A winter weather advisory is in effect from Texas to the Carolinas, said CBS Minnesota meteorologist Lisa Meadows. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced Saturday he'd declared an emergency to help state agencies prepare for a storm that's expected to hit hard the southern part of the state. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued his declaration Friday and said impacts of the storm would vary across the state. Forecasters are calling for up to 18 inches of snow in the mountains and possible flooding at the coast. ""Snow may be beautiful but it can also be treacherous and I urge North Carolinians to take this storm seriously and get ready for it now,"" Cooper said in a statement Friday. The National Weather Service said Saturday the heaviest snow is expected in northwest North Carolina and southern Virginia. The weather service said a ""prolonged period of snow is expected"" to begin as early as Saturday evening and lasting until Monday. Winter storm warnings are in effect for areas in northeastern Georgia, northwestern South Carolina, western North Carolina and southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Winter storm watches and winter weather advisories are also in effect for sections of the southern Plains across the Mid-South as well as parts of northern South Carolina and southwest Virginia.

"WASHINGTON (AP) President Donald Trump and Democrats are trading blame for the partial government shutdown but doing little substantive talking with each other as the disruption in federal services and public employees pay slogs into another weekend.
Trump upped the brinkmanship by threatening anew to close the border with Mexico to press Congress to cave to his demand for money to pay for a wall. Democrats vowed to pass legislation restoring the government as soon as they take control of the House on Thursday, but that wont accomplish anything unless Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate go along with it.
The effects to the public of the impasse grew as the Environmental Protection Agency, which had the money to function a week longer than some agencies, implemented its shutdown plan at midnight Friday night. EPA spokeswoman Molly Block said many of the agencys 14,000 employees were being furloughed while disaster-response teams and certain other employees deemed essential would stay on the job.
Also running short on money: the Smithsonian Institution, which said its museums and galleries popular with visitors and locals in the capital will close starting midweek if the partial shutdown drags on. But federal flood insurance policies will continue to be issued and renewed, in a reversal prompted by pressure from lawmakers, said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.
Trump appeared no closer to securing money for his signature border wall, which he vowed during the campaign that he would make Mexico pay for. Hes failed to do so. Now Democratic leaders are adamant that they will not authorize money for the project, calling it wasteful and ineffective. They show no signs of bending, either.
We are far apart, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told CBS on Friday.
Trump tweeted: We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. He also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, among countries he deems have not done enough to combat illegal immigration.
Hes made similar threats in the past without following through, and it is Congress, not the president, that appropriates aid money.
The shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay.
Trumps incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said Democrats are no longer negotiating with the administration over an earlier offer by the White House to accept less than the $5 billion Trump wants for the wall.
Democrats said the White House offered to accept $2.5 billion for border security, but that Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told Vice President Mike Pence that it wasnt acceptable. It was also not guaranteed that Trump would settle for that amount.
Theres not a single Democrat talking to the president of the United States about this deal, Mulvaney said Friday
Speaking on Fox News and later to reporters, he tried to drive a wedge between Democrats, pinning the blame on House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.
Mulvaney said Schumer was really interested in doing a deal and coming to some sort of compromise but he understood that Pelosi was at risk of losing the speakership of the House if she went along. So were in this for the long haul, he said.
In fact, Pelosi has all but locked up the support she needs to win the speakers gavel Thursday and there has been no sign that she and Schumer are in conflict.
For the White House to try and blame anyone but the president for this shutdown doesnt pass the laugh test, said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.
Pelosi has vowed to pass legislation to reopen the nine shuttered departments and dozens of agencies now hit by the partial shutdown as soon as she takes the gavel, which is expected when the new Congress convenes. But that alone wont solve the shutdown, absent Senate approval and Trumps signature.
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill added that Democrats united against the wall and wont seriously consider any White House offer unless Trump backs it publicly because he has changed his position so many times.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador reacted cautiously to Trumps threat to close the border, calling it an internal affair of the U.S. government.
We are always seeking a good relationship with the United States. We do not want to be rash, he said.
As for EPA, workers needed for preventing immediate public health threats at more than 800 Superfund hazardous-waste sites will remain on the job as well as emergency response workers for disasters.

"Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts says farmers are bearing the brunt of ""the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our state's history."" Ricketts spoke to CBSN on Wednesday about the dire set of circumstances Nebraska faces after the unprecedented flooding disaster. 
Rickets declared a state of emergency as more rain is expected to soak the already flooded region. States of emergency have also been declared in Iowa, Wisconsin and South Dakota. Record-setting flooding hit the Midwest due to a confluence of conditions that include the recent bomb cyclone storm, as well as frozen ground melting in the spring, warming weather patters and heavy rain. The bomb cyclone pummeled the region with low pressure, heavy rains and blizzard-like conditions before melting off and spawning floods that have forced more than 4,400 people to evacuate their homes. 
""Obviously we've got a lot of recovery left ahead of us,"" Ricketts told CBSN. ""It's going to be a long road for us to rebuild our infrastructure and get people back in their homes."" 
The floods have been nothing short of catastrophic: At least three people have died, and estimated farm loses could top $1 billion. Parts of 15 states are under flood watches and warnings. Ricketts said14 state bridges were damaged and 200 miles of highways can't be used until roads are repaired.
""We're still very focused on keeping people safe right now and as late as yesterday we were still conducting rescues of people,"" he added. 
Flooded areas are seen in Bellevue, Nebraska, U.S., March 19, 2019. 
BELLEVUE (NEBRASKA) POLICE DEPARTMENT/via REUTERS
No group of Nebraskans have been hit harder by the floods than the state's farmers, who form the backbone of the region's agricultural economy. 
""In our initial assessment, we've got $400 million in livestock loses and $440 million in grain losses,"" Ricketts said. ""We're encouraging our farmers and ranchers to contact their local FSA office, Farm Service Agency, to notify them that they've got these loses and to keep track of this, so they can take advantage of things like the livestock indemnity program."" He said there's also a conservation program for farmers whose land needs to be rehabilitated. 
Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Omaha, Nebraska on Tuesday to survey the damage and offer support to the region. Ricketts said the state's coordination with the federal government has been ""fantastic"" thus far, stating that he's spoken to regional EPA administrator Paul Taylor, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Cho, and officials at FEMA, who helped the state get its disaster declaration prepared. He said Nebraska has filed paperwork for federal disaster relief funds. 
Ricketts also praised the American Red Cross, which has worked to provide shelter and meals for state residents. ""The Red Cross has been great,"" the governor said. ""They've been the ones setting up most of the shelters we have across our state and serving thousands of meals to take care of folks.""  Ricketts estimated Nebraska has 475 people in shelters. 
When asked for a timeline for full recovery once the waters recede, Ricketts said it will be ""a months-long process"" and referenced a 2011 flood, where it took 108 days for the waters in one region of Nebraska to recede before farmers could access their water treatment plant. 
""We know this will be a long recovery,"" Ricketts said. ""We will work as quickly as possible to get people back in their homes to provide that relief. But when it comes to the major projects like our public infrastructure, roads, bridges, we're going to need the public's patience because it is going to take a while to get all of this recovered.""",Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts spoke with CBSN about the devastating flooding affecting his state,2019-03-20T15:41:53Z,"Nebraska gov. on ""most widespread destruction we've ever seen""",CBS News,1

"(CNN)The US Air Force said Wednesday that it needs nearly $5 billion in additional funding to help rebuild two bases damaged by hurricanes and floods.
""We desperately need the supplemental funding to recover from the natural disasters that hammered Tyndall and Offutt,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said at a speech at the Heritage Foundation Wednesday, referring to installations in Florida and Nebraska that were damaged by a hurricane and flooding.
Tyndall Air Force Base, located just east of Panama City, Florida, was badly damaged by Hurricane Michael in October of last year, and Offutt Air Force Base, just south of Omaha in Nebraska, was flooded earlier this month.
The Air Force said it requires $1.2 billion in additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2019 and $3.7B in fiscal year 2020/2021 to help rebuild the two bases.
Without the additional funding, the Air Force warned that it would have to delay 61 facility repair projects at 18 Air Force bases world-wide.
""These are just the first decisions that we had to make yesterday,"" Wilson said, adding that ""61 projects in 18 states are not going to happen because we have not gotten a disaster supplemental for Tyndall.""
The Air Force warning comes days after similar warnings from the Commandant of the US Marine Corps. Gen. Robert Neller, who said that hurricane repair damage had forced unexpected costs on the Marines and that billions in additional funding were needed.
Neller said that he has been forced to curtail or cancel several training exercises to free up funds for hurricane repair.
The Pentagon is seeking additional funds from Congress to help meet these needs, but the ability to move unused funds from existing accounts toward hurricane and flood repair has been limited by the Trump administration's decision to shift unused funds to help fund a wall on the southern border.
Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan sent a memo last week saying that he had notified Congress of his intent to shift $600 million in 2019 Pentagon funds to help meet hurricane repair related needs, a figure below what Air Force and Marine Corps officials say they need.
The Trump administration's 2020 budget request includes an additional $2 billion in funds for hurricane repair efforts in North Carolina and Florida.

"(CNN) She had pictured the trick plenty of times in her mind's eye and even tried it once onto an airbag but no woman had ever pulled it off on snow. Now, high on Austria's Stubai Glacier, snowboarder Anna Gasser gazed down at the huge white ramp that could propel her into history. Quiet in her helmet and dark goggles, Gasser contemplated her leap into the unknown. ""I'm thinking triple,"" she whispered. Specifically, she was thinking a cab triple 1260, a trick that involves taking off in the switch position -- the opposite direction of travel with your ""wrong"" foot forward -- before completing three-and-a-half full rotations and landing with your other foot in front. Pulling it off would require confidence, commitment, and a whole lot of bottle. ""For sure it was one of the craziest tricks I've ever done,"" the 27-year-old Austrian told CNN Sport. Staring down the run in, Gasser tried to flood her body with confidence. Naturally, though, nerves crept in. Her stomach churned, but she hopped forward on her snowboard and started speeding towards the giant snow ramp sculpted by machines. For sure it was one of the craziest tricks I've ever done. ""I had some butterflies in my stomach for sure before I dropped in,"" said Gasser, who won gold in the big air contest at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in 2018. ""There was not much going through my mind actually, I was just trying to trust myself and telling myself that I could do it. Other than that, I was just full-on focusing on what I wanted to do."" Gasser knew a big take off would be essential. A triple requires far more force and power than your average jump; complete commitment to the cause is key, because abandoning the trick midair can be treacherous. She sped up the steep ramp and launched into the Austrian sky. Once airborne, the feeling was like nothing she had experienced on a snowboard before. Gasser had made history before when she became the first female snowboarder to perform a cab double cork 900 -- two back somersaults and a horizontal spin, giving the effect of a corkscrew -- in November 2013. Now she was about to take the sport into another new realm. My heart was still racing and I had so much adrenaline. ""I had more physical power than I've experienced compared to another trick... There's so much more physics to jump up and spin that fast,"" says Gasser. ""As soon as I took off I knew there was no way back because when you initiate it you cannot open up anymore. It's maybe more dangerous than just going for it."" It was a trick so daring, so nerve-wracking, and so exhilarating, that it took Gasser an hour away from the slopes to come to terms with what she had just done and for the rush to subside. ""My heart was still racing and I had so much adrenaline,"" she says. ""I went to sit down for an hour before I started riding again."" Her secret? It was all about waiting for the right moment and seizing it with both hands when it came. ""I've had the trick on my mind for a long time, over a yea now,"" she admits. ""I've been doing doubles for so long and I knew the next step would be to go for the triple. I just knew I had to feel it and that was the case when I was at Stubai."" Gasser's milestone was, in many ways, a giant leap for women's snowboarding, five years after her double. To put that in perspective, Torstein Horgmo became the first man to land a triple cork in 2010, seven years after JP Walker stomped the first recorded double. Gasser has arrived at her snowboarding career via an early life competing in gymnastics. Despite being selected for the Austrian national squad at the age of 14, she wasn't satisfied her athletic energies being spent on the bars. ""I was a competitive kid and I just thought that I wasn't good enough at gymnastics at that age,"" she explains. ""It was really time consuming. I had a lot of fun and it was a passion of mine but at one point I was like, it's not worth the work for what I get out of it. ""Then I stopped with the gymnastics side and after not doing anything for two years my cousin took me snowboarding for the first time and I just loved. ""It's more about freedom. You always decide yourself what you're going to do with snowboarding. In gymnastics someone tells you what to do; with snowboarding actually in the first couple of years it was everything I wanted to do. I loved it from the beginning."" It's a love that, in recent years, has brought great success. Slopestyle gold at the Winter X Games in 2017 was backed up with big air gold at the world championships in Sierra Nevada a few months later. At the start of 2018 she won gold at the Winter X Games, and she added victory in the inaugural Olympic big air competition in South Korea. With the confidence of the world's first cab triple 1260 in her locker, Gasser is flying high. But she's keen to keep pushing the sport -- and herself. ""In snowboarding there are always a lot of ways to improve,"" she says. ""It doesn't always have to be a triple. ""There so much more stuff I can learn and want to learn. ""Of course I want to be one of the top girls but I'm just going to see how it feels. In this sport you never know what's going to happen.""","She had pictured the trick plenty of times in her mind's eye and even tried it once onto an airbag but no woman had ever pulled it off on snow.

Authorities in Sonoma County, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of San Francisco, issued the evacuation orders on Tuesday as the Russian River threatened to flood. 
“Please, heed the warning, evacuate now,” Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said at a news conference on Tuesday. “Do not wait until it’s too late.” 
The evacuation orders affected more than 20 communities stretching dozens of miles along the river, including Guerneville, with a population of more than 4,500 people. 
The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office posted video online on Tuesday that showed water running down a stairway at a house in the community of Summerhome Park. 
The sheriff’s office deployed two boats on the river to help with the evacuation, Essick said. 
The Russian River surpassed its flood stage of 32 feet (9.8 meters) on Tuesday evening, according to a website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
The river was projected to crest at a height of 46 feet at 10 p.m. local time on Wednesday, Sonoma County officials said in a warning posted online. 
The Russian River reached flood stage after three days of heavy rains, with melting snow from the mountains also playing a role, Sonoma County director of emergency management Christopher Godley said at the news conference.

"(CNN) The rain falling in some parts of Northern California could bring frustration to search crews, more suffering to displaced people and relief to firefighters battling the Camp Fire. Authorities fear the showers -- even as they clear the choking smoke and help extinguish flames -- will trigger mudslides and floods in areas scarred by the state's deadliest blaze, complicating the search for remains. Rain could also pile on misery for people forced from their homes, some of whom are living in tented camps outside. Two weeks after the devastating fire started, 563 people are unaccounted for, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said. Of those killed, at least 58 of them have been tentatively identified as rescue crews sift through debris, searching for the remains of loved ones. The rain could make the process of scouring through the ash and debris more complicated, and lead to treacherous conditions for firefighters, officials said. It has been raining on and off for the past several hours in the town of Paradise, which was wiped out by the fire. A flash flood watch remains in effect through Friday morning, CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. 1 million people are under flash flood watch Almost 1 million people are under flash flood watch in that part of California, where 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected through Friday. Rain began falling in Paradise on Wednesday, with nearly an inch dropped by late afternoon. Potential downpours could end the fire season or at least ease the risk while bringing new dangers. ""Rapidly rising water could flood roads, hampering search efforts and putting displaced residents camping outdoors in peril,"" Norman said. Search for missing to be 'much more difficult' The first bout of heavy rain is expected to hit Butte County. The heaviest amounts will come Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon, with between 2.5 and 4 inches expected during that 24-hour period. When the rain comes, it's going to have major effects on the debris. ""It's going to consolidate the material and make it more dense. And it's going to present much more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find that's still there, it's going to make a difficult task... that much more difficult,"" said Brian Ferreira, rescue squad officer for California Task Force 4. In Paradise, a town virtually wiped out by the Camp Fire, the storms could cause ash flows, or a slurry of ash swept away by rainwater. Evacuees flee, some brace for flooding Across Butte County, residents prepared for a possible deluge. Jennifer Debrunner is staying at the Butte County Fairgrounds in a motor home loaned by a stranger. She told CNN affiliate KCRA that her family covered everything they own with a tarp. Debrunner said she knows the rain will bring ""a lot of mud, a lot of cold"" to the area. But this Thanksgiving week, Debrunner said she's grateful her family has a borrowed RV. Cady Machado has been camping out in a Walmart parking lot with her husband and 9-month-old baby. Due to the expected rain, Machado told CNN affiliate KTXL, she's sending her child to her sister's in Arizona. As for herself and her husband? ""There's a nice bridge with my name on it to go underneath where I won't get flooded out with my husband,"" she told KTXL. Woolsey Fire now contained Rain also is expected in Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire has killed three people and torched nearly 100,000 acres. It's now 100% contained. The Woolsey burn area is expected to get less than an inch of rain. But it's still at risk of mudslides and minor debris flow from Wednesday to Thursday, the National Weather Service said.

"A woman who has accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of raping her while they were undergraduates at Duke University nearly two decades ago called Monday for the state's general assembly to hold a public hearing into her allegations and those of another woman against the Democrat.
Meredith Watson wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece that she was ""frustrated by calls for an investigation rather than a public hearing"" into the allegations brought against Fairfax by her and Vanessa Tyson.
""Such 'investigations' are secret proceedings, out of the public eye, leaving victims vulnerable to selective leaks and smears. And we all know how such investigations end: with 'inconclusive results,'"" Watson wrote. ""My privacy has already been violated, yet I am still willing to testify publicly under oath. Tyson has made the same offer. Our plea to the Virginia General Assembly to require the same of Fairfax has been met with inaction.""
Watson has said that Fairfax raped her in 2000, but that she did not report it because of how Duke officials responded to her earlier claim that she was raped by basketball star Corey Maggette. An attorney for Watson has claimed that Fairfax was one of the people she told about the alleged assault by Maggette and that the future lieutenant governor ""used this prior assault against Ms. Watson"" when he allegedly raped her. The attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, claimed that Fairfax told Watson at a campus party after the alleged assault that ""I knew that because of what happened to you last year, you’d be too afraid to say anything.""
FACEBOOK MESSAGES SHOW SECOND FAIRFAX ACCUSER DETAILED RAPE ALLEGATIONS DURING 2017 RACE
Last week, Fox News obtained Facebook messages from Watson in which she commented on Fairfax's 2017 candidacy for Virginia lieutenant governor and told contacts about the alleged rape.
""I see you’ve been promoting Justin Fairfax on FB despite knowing he raped me, which is mind-blowing to me. Are you seriously voting for him today? #METOO,” she wrote to one contact on Election Day, 2017.
Tyson, an associate professor of politics at Scripps College in California, previously accused Fairfax of forcing her to perform oral sex on him during the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax, who was attending Columbia Law School, was working as a so-called ""body man"" for vice presidential nominee John Edwards.
Fairfax has said that the encounters with Watson and Tyson were consensual and suggested that both women's accusations are part of a political smear campaign to prevent him from succeeding Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam if he's forced to resign amid a racist photo scandal.
Watson wrote that she had refused to make her allegations ""a partisan issue"" or ""a financial issue by suing for compensation. I have refused to make it a law-enforcement issue. Despite nearly 100 offers to be interviewed, I have refused to make my rape a media opportunity ... My motivation was never for personal gain. And what have I gained? I have endured relentless scrutiny of my personal life and an unending, bitter flood of hurtful misinformation trumpeted by the media.""

""Despite every attempt to shame me, I am not ashamed,"" Watson concluded. ""It is Justin Fairfax who should be ashamed. It is the Virginia legislature that should be ashamed. And it is the media that should be ashamed.
""If we as a society continue to allow women who report rape to be abused, disparaged and tormented a second time, then shame on us all.""

"A weather system known as an ""atmospheric river"" is unleashing heavy rain across California, bringing the threat of mudslides and flooding Thursday to a region that's already been slammed by days of rain and heavy snow.
The National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center said a strong storm system is unleashing an ""anomalous surge of tropical moisture"" across the Golden State.
""Several inches of rainfall is expected across much of southern California, with the highest totals for the coastal mountain ranges,"" the NWS said. ""There is a high risk of excessive rainfall on Thursday for the southern California mountains, capable of causing flash flooding and mudslides.""
WHAT IS AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER?
The storm system is part of what's known as an atmospheric river, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says is a huge plume of subtropical moisture.
""Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics,"" the NOAA states. ""These columns of vapor move with the weather, carrying an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River.""
Atmospheric rivers bring plumes of moisture from the tropics to the Western U.S.
 (NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS))
The storm on Thursday spawned flash flood warnings across the state, with forecasters urging residents to move away from areas that recently burned in wildfires over fears heavy rains will likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows.

"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is facing yet more reports that she mistreated staff working in her Senate office, including claims that she attempted to torpedo departing employee’s future job opportunities -- an allegation the senator denies.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential intentions earlier this month, has been dogged by claims of mistreating her staff. On Friday The New York Times reported on a bizarre allegation that she’d berated a staff member for failing to bring her a fork with her salad. She is alleged to have chastised the aide, and then ate the salad with a comb before telling the aide to clean the comb.
AMY KLOBUCHAR REPORTEDLY ORDERED STAFFER TO CLEAN COMB AFTER SHE USED IT TO EAT SALAD
It was part of a list of incidents that aides described as being “not just demanding, but often dehumanizing.”
HuffPost, citing multiple Capitol Hill staffers and former Klobuchar employees, reported Friday that Klobuchar is “well known” for calling prospective employers and shutting down job opportunities for her departing staff. That includes at least one opportunity within the Obama Treasury Department, according to the outlet.
Klobuchar’s office denied the claims, telling the outlet: “This is completely false. The senator has never criticized her staff to prospective employees.”
In one example, HuffPost reported that Klobuchar confronted a fellow Democrat and told them she wanted the offer rescinded. The Democrat ignored her and the staffer joined their team.
Former staffers told the outlet that fear of her attempting to kill off a job offer was so well known that the culture in the office was to treat a job offer “like a state secret.”
Klobuchar has been hit by a flood of allegations in outlets such as The Times, HuffPost and Buzzfeed, including that her conduct became so well known that the Senate minority leader at that time, Harry Reid, D-Nev., told her to change her behavior.
AMY KLOBUCHAR'S TREATMENT OF STAFF LED TO REBUKE FROM HARRY REID: REPORT
During an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier last week, though, Klobuchar said she spoke with Reid, and “he doesn’t remember that and I don’t remember that either.”
But according to a Buzzfeed News report, numerous staffers said Klobuchar routinely sent late-night emails and berated subordinates over minor details and missteps. The report also said, ""one aide was accidentally hit with a flying binder, according to someone who saw it happen, though the staffer said the senator did not intend to hit anyone with the binder when she threw it.""
When asked about the report that she threw a binder, she did not flat-out deny it.

""I don't know, it's all anonymous. I will say that I'm proud of our staff,"" Klobuchar told Fox News last week. ""And yes, I can be a tough boss, and push people -- that's obvious. But that's because I have high expectations of myself, I have high expectations of those who work for me, and I have a high expectation for our country. My chief of staff has worked for me for six years, my state director for seven years, my campaign manager for 14 years.""
Asked specifically whether she had thrown a binder at someone, Klobuchar responded: ""If you look at that story, I think you'll see it said something about me throwing a binder down -- not at somebody,"" Klobuchar said. ""I just know that I should be judged, and I will take responsibility for, everything that happens on this campaign.""

"Officials with the Tampa International Airport (TPA) say there is no credible threat against the air hub after hackers took control of the Tampa mayor’s Twitter account and made bomb threats on Thursday morning.
The personal Twitter account of Mayor Bob Buckhorn of Tampa, Fla., was hacked early Thursday morning with the hijacker posting racist and pornographic images and a threat against Tampa International Airport (TPA). Reps for the mayor have confirmed they are working to suspend the account.
Around 4 a.m. on Feb. 21, Twitter messages with offensive content and photos — described as “racist, misogynistic, and pornographic” by Fox 13 — began to flood the personal Twitter feed of the Sunshine State mayor, spamming his following of 52,000.
MAN'S GUN ALLEGEDLY STOLEN FROM SFO BAGGAGE CAROUSEL: 'THIS IS A NIGHTMARE'
""I have hidden a bomb in a package somewhere at the Tampa international aiport,"" one tweet from the hacker read. ""Looking forward to seeing some minorities die.""
“EMERGENCY ALERT BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAD INBOUND TO TAMPA BAY AREA. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL,” another message read, as per WFLA.
Threats against Tampa city employees and the local VA office were also posted from the compromised account, as per Fox 13.
Ashley Bauman, Buckhorn's communications director, released the following statement in response to the incident:
“Earlier this morning we noticed someone hacked Mayor Buckhorn's twitter account, this was clearly not Mayor Buckhorn. Upon noticing the hack we immediately began investigating these reprehensible tweets. We will work with our Tampa Police Department as well as all investigators to figure out how this breach was made,” Bauman told WFLA. “We urge residents to change their passwords and continue to alert officials when they see an unlikely change in account activity. We are work working with law enforcement to investigate all threats made by this hack.""
Buckhorn told WFLA that he is out of state on a hunting trip, and that his staffers are working to get the hacked social media account closed.

Reps for the Tampa Police Department (TPD) and TPA airport police have also said that there are no “known credible threats” to the airport at this time.
""Tampa Police are investigating a hack to Mayor Bob Buckhorn's Twitter account. The Mayor is aware of the hack. TPD detectives are working to determine who is behind the despicable messages. There are no known credible threats,"" TPD spokesman Steve Hegarty told WFLA.
“Airport Police are aware of hackers who made threats against the airport via the Tampa mayor’s twitter account. Police do not believe the threats are credible but are taking appropriate action to ensure the safety of TPA. Operations for passengers are normal at this time,” reps for the air hub tweeted from TPA’s official Twitter account.

"Comedian Michelle Wolf, who made headlines last year after her controversial performance at the 2018 White House Correspondents' Association dinner, gave her thoughts on President Trump's announcement that he was skipping the event for the third year in a row.
Wolf, 33, told Variety during the Power of Women NY event presented by Lifetime Friday, that Trump is probably not attending the April 27 press dinner because ""can't handle being made fun of."" Audi a premiere sponsor of the event while Shea Moisture, iHeart Media and Icelandic Glacial are additional sponsors.
“He’s probably just really busy,” the comedian said of the commander in chief. “You know, he’s got to golf. And honestly I don’t know if anyone really wants to watch him eat, so I think it’s for the best probably. You gotta love someone that just can’t handle being made fun of.”
President Trump on Friday said that he once again would not be attending the White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) dinner set for later this month. 
 (AP)
When asked if she thinks Trump should attend the event, which is a fundraiser for college scholarship where politicians, journalists and celebrities mix, Wolf said he should 'man up.'
COMEDIAN MICHELLE WOLF'S JOKES FALL FLAT, OR OFFEND, AT DC DINNER
“I think he doesn’t have a big enough spine to attend,” she told Variety. “If a president can’t take someone making fun of them, I don’t really care about them.”
Trump announced Friday that he’ll skip the “boring” and “negative” dinner. He said he will hold one of his signature political rallies instead. This year, organizers decided to scrap the usual format featuring a comedian and instead are having Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow speak. Chernow wrote the biography about founding father Alexander Hamilton that inspired the hit Broadway show ""Hamilton.""
The White House Correspondents' Association decided to shift to a featured speaker instead of a comic after a sharply anti-Trump performance last year by Wolf that some believed was too pointed against White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and other White House staff. The jokes aimed at Sanders prompted many to call out Wolf for attacks on Sanders' job performance, appearance and even her Southern roots.
""I actually really like Sarah. I think she’s very resourceful,"" Wolf said at last year's event. ""She burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies.""
MICHELLE WOLF: WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION 'COWARDS' FOR DITCHING COMEDIANS IN 2019
""I'm never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders,"" the comedian continued. ""Is it Sarah Sanders? Is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?""
When it was announced that the association would ditch comedy for a speaker, Wolf called them “cowards.”
“The @whca are cowards. The media is complicit. And I couldn't be prouder,” Wolf tweeted at the time.
While Trump has not attended the dinner as president, he has gone in the past. He was famously mocked by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner.

"Heavy snow and strong winds hammered parts of the central U.S. on Thursday, knocking out power to tens of thousands of people and creating hazardous travel conditions a day after pummeling Colorado.
The spring blizzard — the second ""bomb cyclone"" storm system to hit the region in a month — left behind hundreds of canceled flights at Denver International Airport, along with wintertime temperatures and snarled traffic before blanketing parts of South Dakota in as much as 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) of snow.
Hundreds of schools canceled classes in Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota, where the governor closed state offices in much of the state for a second day Thursday because of dangerous road conditions.
The Minnesota State Patrol said it had responded to more than 200 crashes statewide since Wednesday, while the National Guard stood ready to rescue any stranded motorists. In Nebraska, the State Patrol sent additional troopers into the state's panhandle, and several highways were closed.
Whiteout conditions were reported in western Nebraska and northwest Kansas, while blizzard conditions were expected to linger into early Friday in Minnesota.
A ""bomb cyclone"" is a weather phenomenon that entails a rapid drop in air pressure and a storm strengthening explosively. Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota, said this week's storm system drew up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico as it moved out of the Rocky Mountains.
Connelly said that could translate into as much as 2 feet (0.61 meters) of snow in parts of South Dakota and Minnesota, and make the snowfall ""historic.""
""This time of year (in) the central, southern Plains, you get severe weather — thunderstorms and tornadoes. Unfortunately in the Dakotas, we get feet of snow,"" he said.
Nearly 40,000 homes and business were without power across Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa early Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us. The main culprit was snow and ice accumulating on power lines, along with strong winds, said Matt Lindstrom, spokesman for Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy.
In southwest Minnesota, the National Weather Service said there could be half an inch of ice accumulations and winds up to 50 mph (80.46 kph).
The system also created hazardous wildfire conditions in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as ""thunder snow"" — snow accompanied by thunder and lightning — was reported Wednesday in central South Dakota.
In addition to the immediate impacts, the storm threatened to swell rivers in the Midwest that flooded after March's drenching, which caused billions of dollars in flood damage in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota. Forecasters aren't expecting similar flooding this time around thanks to the absence of a wet snowpack on frozen ground.
But even moderate rises in the Missouri River will push more water ianto drenched Fremont County in southwestern Iowa, Emergency Manager Mike Crecelius said. Last month's flooding swamped 455 houses and thousands of acres of farmland in his region.
""The problem is that we're not getting any time for the water to recede and things to dry out, so the levees can't be fixed; houses can't be fixed; crops can't be planted,"" he said.

"Eastern Syria — Fierce battles are being fought as U.S.-backed forces appear on the verge of taking the last ISIS stronghold in eastern Syria. As the military moves in, civilians are pouring out. 
CBS News saw the latest surge in an overwhelming flood of civilians. Human shields trapped inside the last remaining ISIS village are the single biggest obstacle slowing down the U.S.-led offensive.
On Tuesday, there were 500 people alone, who said they escaped in the early hours, defying ISIS death threats. They wouldn't let us go, Hala Mohammed, a mother of five said. She said they had to risk their lives to get there.
Every day, they came out streaming out — far more than soldiers in the region anticipated. What's striking is the number of children, who have only known life under ISIS.
If there is a positive note about the mass exodus, it's that people here say there are now very few civilians left inside. There are just 500 to 600 ISIS fighters facing inevitable defeat.
For Hala, whose husband has already been killed in an airstrike, there's no love lost. When asked what it means to her to see the end of ISIS, she said they mean nothing, calling them trash.
With civilians left, the U.S.-led defeat of the last ISIS holdouts in Syria may be imminent. Each person who escapes that village is one less civilian to worry about inside it.

"The problem may be more than government indifference, said Josh Wright, executive director of Ideas42, which uses behavioral science to study and design public policies. Some states lets be realistic: They dont want it to be easier, he said.
Signing up for SNAP, getting a shelter bed, going to housing court or getting out of jail after an arrest can involve considerable amounts of frustration, confusion and disrespect. And its often said that being poor is expensive. Late fees, money-transfer fees, check-cashing fees, exorbitant interest, reconnection fees and overdraft fees all add up to poor people spending proportionally more on financial services than wealthier people.
Technology can provide solutions to obstacles:
Systems dont take human nature into account.
The early SNAP payment did, in fact, set off a flood of early spending. Communications about the early payment werent very good; many beneficiaries might have thought that the money was extra, or that their benefits card wouldnt work in February. Mr. Kaiser gave an example from Vermont, which normally deposits benefits on the first of the month: The average balance on Feb. 3 was $88, compared with $145 on Jan. 3.
But not for Ms. Stoneman. She was relieved when she learned February benefits were coming, despite the shutdown. But she knew she had to be careful. I might go too far on buying groceries and not be able to be prepared for next month, she said. My kids have birthdays next month, and I want to be able to make a cake.
Then Ms. Stoneman got a message on her Fresh EBT app: Want help budgeting your February benefits? Hide some of your benefits from your balance to help you budget. You can still spend your full amount any time.
She eagerly signed up. I knew I needed to set this aside and not spend it, she said.
Others didnt manage it. Mr. Kaiser said that a third of Fresh EBT users benefits had already been spent by Feb 1. (He said the company doesn't know yet whether the ""hide my benefits"" tool helped.) In mid-January, he said, Propel went to Full Cart, which ships free meal kits as a part of the organization Feeding Children Everywhere, offering to raise the money to pay for at least half a million meals for the end of February. They have so far raised a quarter of the needed funds, he said.
In normal months, most people with Fresh EBT use it to check their balance. Before the app, they had to buy something, creating what Mr. Kaiser calls the balance banana. Or they had to call an 800 number. That took 10 or 15 minutes, Ms. Stoneman said. The app is better. Im on it every day.","From managing the government’s SNAP food-assistance program to paying parking tickets on time or using payday loans, new apps can guide low-income people through complexity.",2019-02-05T04:35:50Z,Fixes: Navigating Bureaucracy?

"WASHINGTON (AP) The Trump administration is considering using billions in unspent disaster relief funds earmarked for areas including hurricane-pounded Puerto Rico and Texas and more than a dozen other states to pay for President Donald Trumps border wall as he weighs signing a national emergency declaration to get it built without Congress.
The White House has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to comb through its budget, including $13.9 billion in emergency funds that Congress earmarked last year, to see what money could be diverted to the wall as part of a declaration. Thats according to a congressional aide and administration official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
It is the latest sign that the administration is laying the groundwork for a possible emergency order as negotiations between Trump and congressional Democrats to reopen the partially shuttered government have ground to a halt. Trump is demanding billions for his wall that Democrats wont give him. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are set to miss paychecks Friday.
Trump on Thursday gave his strongest public indication yet that he is leaning toward an emergency declaration as he traveled to the Texas border to continue to press his case for the wall.
Trump told reporters as he left the White House that he was still holding out hope for a deal, but that if it doesnt work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.
Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers, was traveling with Trump on Thursday. The Army Corps of Engineers directed questions to the Pentagon, which directed questions to Congress.
Nearly $14 billion in emergency disaster relief funds have been allocated but not yet obligated through contracts for a variety of projects in states including California, Florida and Texas and in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico that have been ravaged by recent hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, according to the aide familiar with the matter.
The money funds a variety of projects, mostly flood control to prevent future disasters.
A second official with knowledge of the proposal said it would fund construction of about 315 miles (500 kilometers) of border barrier. Right now, barriers blanket about one-third of the 1,954-mile (3,145-kilometer) border with Mexico.
Defense Department officials had already been combing data on more than $10 billion in military construction projects to determine how much of it would be available for emergency spending this year.
Officials have estimated that roughly one-quarter to one-third of the money, or $2.5 billion to $3 billion, could be available less than the $5.7 billion Trump is seeking. The majority has also already been obligated meaning that it has been spent or a contract has been signed and there would be penalties for cancellation.
Regardless of where the money is found, an emergency declaration would draw immediate legal challenge from Democrats, who have accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis at the southern border to justify his wall. Critics have said the move would be an unconstitutional abuse of emergency powers. Trump said Thursday that his lawyers have told him he has the absolute right.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers raised immediate concerns over shifting funds that have already been approved by Congress for projects in states across the nation.
Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, a top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said he has been hearing from lawmakers in recent days concerned that Army Corps projects in their states could be canceled or postponed.
If they drag the money out of here, Simpson said in an interview late Thursday, a lot of members will have problem with it.
Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., the incoming chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in an interview that rebuilding the disaster areas is a way higher priority benefiting the American people than a wasteful wall.
He said the Army Corps works on dams, levees and other projects across the nation and has an enormous backlog of unfunded needs. It would be an incredible disservice to the American people and the economy to divert the money to the border wall, he said.
And Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., said in a statement that it would be beyond appalling for the president to take money from places like Puerto Rico that have suffered enormous catastrophes, costing thousands of American citizens lives, in order to pay for Donald Trumps foolish, offensive and hateful wall.
Siphoning funding from real disasters to pay for a crisis manufactured by the president is wholly unacceptable and the American people wont fall for it, she said.

"Donald Trump is the richest president in U.S. history – but as he gears up for a re-election campaign, the real estate magnate could end up facing off against someone even wealthier.
The budding 2020 field of potential challengers includes no fewer than four fellow billionaires.
The wealthiest of the pack, by far, is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The media mogul and gun control advocate’s net worth is estimated at nearly $52 billion, according to the latest Forbes 400 Richest Americans list.
That dwarfs Trump, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $3.1 billion (though Trump has claimed his net worth is higher). Bloomberg may be the best-known of the billionaires eyeing a bid – and the most likely to take the plunge, given recent trips to early-voting states and a public switch back to the Democratic Party after years as an independent – but several others have stirred speculation.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
They include: Hedge fund-manager-turned-environmental-activist Tom Steyer (worth $1.6 billion, says Forbes); former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (worth $3.3 billion); and investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban (worth $3.9 billion).
It’s unclear if any of them would decide to run. While Cuban reportedly is flirting with a White House bid as a Republican or independent, the other three would be entering a sprawling Democratic field that includes high-profile senators and several former presidential candidates.
At least on the Democratic side, their immense wealth could amount to a double-edged sword.
Like Trump, they would have the ability to self-finance – which would help not only flood the airwaves with commercials but assert their political independence from special interests. Trump wouldn’t be the only one who could claim he’s not for sale with donors.
“What it can do is keep you in the race a lot longer than somebody who’s not able to raise money and it obviously allows you to get your message out, whatever that is,” said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist who served as senior aide on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
At the same time, their wealth could become a liability, as they seek the nomination in a party where all the energy is with the progressive wing.
“I think it’s an uphill battle for a billionaire in the Democratic Party in a way that is distinct from the Republican Party,” said Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America. “It’s not necessarily going to hurt them, but it’s definitely not going to help them.”
Sroka noted the “income inequality” issue will be front and center in the Democratic primary.
“It’s not as if it’s a cross to bear, but it’s something that they’re going to have to talk about and be forthright with throughout the primary process,” he said.
For now, Bloomberg is attracting the most attention among the billionaires. He took a highly visible swipe at the president over the weekend, with a blistering column for his media company decrying Trump's ""recklessly emotional and senselessly chaotic approach to the job.""
A former Republican turned independent who returned to the Democratic Party this year, Bloomberg made stops in the early caucus and primary voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this past fall, fueling speculation he’s gearing up for a White House run.
“He’s done a lot of good in his post-mayoral life with his wealth and he’s espoused a lot of progressive values as part of that,” Elrod said of Bloomberg’s efforts to battle gun violence and his vow to make climate change the defining issue in 2020.
But she added that “the biggest thing that’s going to hurt him more than his personal wealth is the fact that he used to be a Republican.” She said that would be a “far bigger liability” competing in “a very left-leaning progressive grassroots primary.”
2020 DEM PROSPECTS MAKE EARLY MOVES IN IOWA
Steyer, meanwhile, has attracted attention spending millions on a campaign to impeach the president. The former hedge fund manager – who’s said he’ll decide on a White House run early in the new year – kicked off a town hall tour this month in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote in the primary and caucus calendar. That tour will also bring him to New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada, other early-voting states.
Steyer has also built up a vast email distribution list through his “Need to impeach” drive and NextGenAmerica, the grassroots advocacy organization he created five years ago.
“When you think of Tom Steyer, the first thing Democratic voters think of is he’s for impeachment, which is not a bad thing, because he’s able to get his message out and break through,” Elrod said.
But she questioned whether the impeachment push would actually translate to primary votes.
Schultz, who suffers from a lack of name recognition compared with some of the other uber-wealthy potential candidates, has hired a major public relations team and is expected to crisscross the country early in 2019 as he promotes a new book.
For any of these businessmen who enter politics, strategists say the message will matter more than the money.
“You can bring a lot of big money in, but we just saw in some of our recent elections here that that doesn’t mean at the end of the day that you’re going to be the one with your name on the ballot,” Zandra Rice-Hawkins, executive director of the New Hampshire-based progressive group Granite State Progress, said.
Ultimately, a hurdle for these candidates may be whether any of them can represent change in a party torn between the old and new guard, after rallying behind Clinton in 2016 only to see the establishment choice narrowly lose to Trump.
“I don’t know that the Democrats are necessarily interested in a candidate like [the billionaires] rather than somebody who is younger or who speaks to questions of diversity or who is going to run a much more unabashedly liberal or progressive campaign,” Saint Anselm College politics professor Christopher Galdieri said.","Battle of billionaires brewing?

"(CNN)Numerous rivers in the Southeast are overspilling their banks after recent heavy rains, and communities along the lower Mississippi River in particular have days to go before they see the worst of it.
In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Friday because the threat of more rain in the region and more flooding along the Mississippi. 
The US Army Corps of Engineers this week opened Louisiana's Bonnet Carre Spillway to divert rising water away from New Orleans to sparsely populated areas. In the capital, Baton Rouge, the river already was at more than 41.28 feet -- more than 1 foot above major flood stage -- and it could rise another 2 feet over the next two weeks, the National Weather Service says.
""We anticipate some parishes may need assistance dealing with these conditions and the state stands ready to offer that support,"" Edwards said.
The river, already at flood stage in areas from Missouri south into Louisiana and Mississippi, isn't expected to crest in many of those places for days.
In Memphis, Tennessee, the Mississippi is forecast to crest around Wednesday around 41.5 feet -- only 1.5 feet above moderate flood stage, but it would be the fourth-highest crest recorded there, the National Weather Service says.
There, the river has been over its banks for days. Satellite images distributed by NASA show the flooded river on Monday, compared with the same area in late February 2014, with Memphis shown on upper right side of the river.
In Mississippi, north of Vicksburg, farmers were using bulldozers and other equipment to build levees to protect homes from rising waters this week, CNN affiliate WLBT reported.
""This water simply doesn't have anywhere to go,"" Warren County emergency management director John Elfer told WLBT on Monday.
 ""There's still a snow melt we have to account for. There's been a tremendous amount of rain north in the Ohio River valley. As a result, this is what you're seeing.""
Widespread rain is expected from Friday into the weekend for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas, forecasters say.

"(Reuters) - Heavy rains are expected in northern California on Tuesday, raising the risk of mudslides and hindering the search for more victims of the deadliest wildfire in the state’s history as nearly 1,000 people remain listed as missing. Remains of 79 victims have been recovered since the Camp Fire erupted on Nov. 8 and largely obliterated the Sierra foothills town of Paradise, a community of nearly 27,000 people about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. The missing persons list kept by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office still has 993 names on it. That number has fluctuated dramatically over the past week as additional people were reported missing, or as some initially listed as unaccounted for either turn up alive or are identified among the dead. Sheriff Kory Honea has said some people have been added to the list more than once at times under variant spellings of their names. As of Monday, the fire has torched more than 151,000 acres (61,100 hectares) of parched scrub and trees, incinerating about 12,000 homes along the way, Cal Fire said. Containment lines have been built around 70 percent of its perimeter, according to the agency. Efforts to further suppress the flames were likely to benefit from a storm expected to dump as much as 4 inches (10 cm) of rain north of San Francisco between late Tuesday and Friday, said Patrick Burke, a National Weather Service forecaster. ‘MUDDY, MUSHY MESS’ But heavy showers risk setting off mudslides in newly burned areas while also making it more difficult for forensic teams sifting through cinders and debris for additional human remains. Colleen Fitzpatrick, founder of the California-based consulting company Identifinders International, said rain would turn the site into a “muddy, mushy mess”, slick with wet ash. Pathologists from the University of Nevada, Reno worked through the weekend as firefighters peeled back debris, collecting bits of burned bones and photographing everything that might help identify victims. The risk of mudslides could also increase the misery of the evacuees, some of whom are living in tents or camping out of their cars. Residents who only recently were permitted back in homes that survived the fire may be ordered to evacuate again if they live downslope from badly burned areas. Intense fire over the slopes of canyons, hills and mountains makes them more prone to landslides, by burning away vegetation and organic material that normally holds soil in place. The fire also creates a hard, waxy surface that tends to repel rather than absorb water. The result can be heavy runoff of rainwater mixed with mud, boulders, trees and other debris that flows downhill with tremendous force, said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey. “Those debris flows have the consistency of wet concrete and move faster than you can run,” he said. “It’s like a flood on steroids... and a big one can take out two-story buildings.” The number of residents needing temporary shelter was unclear, but as many as 52,000 people were under evacuation orders at the height of the firestorm last week. Nearly 500 miles south of Paradise near Malibu, west of Los Angeles, at least two inches of rain are expected to fall on a second fire, the Woolsey, which has killed three people. That blaze was 94 percent contained by Monday morning. The cause of both fires is under investigation, but electric utilities reported localized equipment problems around the time they broke out. PG&amp;E Corp has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire.

"Light right falling Wednesday in some areas of Northern California could aid crews fighting a deadly wildfire while raising the risk of flash floods and complicating efforts to recover the remains of those killed. Heavier rain was expected later in the day in the Paradise burn area, where a monstrous wildfire has killed at least 81 people and destroyed more than 13,000 homes. Residents of communities charred by a Los Angeles-area fire stacked sandbags as they prepared for possible downpours that threaten to unleash runoff from hillsides left barren by flames. Forecasters say rain expected over areas of Southern California burned by recent wildfires could cause mudslides and rock slides. In Paradise, teams sifted through ash and debris as they searched for bodies about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northwest of San Francisco. ""The task is arduous,"" said Rick Crawford with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ""And the possibility exists that some people may never be found."" Officials said nearly 870 people were still unaccounted for. Precipitation could hinder the search by washing away fragmentary remains and turning ash into a thick paste. Authorities trying to identify people killed are using rapid DNA testing that provides results in just two hours. The system can analyze DNA from bone fragments or other remains, then match it to genetic material provided by relatives of the missing. The technology depends on people coming forward to give a DNA sample via a cheek swab. But as of Tuesday, nearly two weeks after the start of the inferno, only about 60 people had provided samples to pop-up labs, said Annette Mattern, a spokeswoman for ANDE, a Colorado company that is donating use of the technology. ""We need hundreds,"" Mattern said. ""We need a big enough sample for us to make a positive ID on these and to also give a better idea of how many losses there actually are."" The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for Paradise and nearby communities and for those areas charred by wildfires earlier this year in Lake, Shasta, Trinity and Mendocino counties. The Camp Fire, which has burned an area about the size of Chicago nearly 238 square miles (616 square kilometers) was 75 percent contained. In Southern California, people who worried days earlier that their homes might be consumed by flames were taking precautions against possible mudslides caused by the approaching storm. Residents filling sandbags at Malibu's Zuma Beach were mindful of a disaster that struck less than a year ago when a downpour on a fresh burn scar sent home-smashing debris flows through Montecito, killing 21 people and leaving two missing.

"Washington (CNN)The specter of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has loomed over all but a few months of President Donald Trump's presidency.
Now, the President and his aides are bracing for Mueller's investigation to conclude -- and whether his final report will signal the end of their long legal nightmare, or merely the beginning.
But like everybody else in Washington, the White House is in wait-and-see mode. White House officials are aware of the speculation that Mueller could file his report at any moment and are prepared for that possibility, but they have no special insight or inside information about when that will happen.
""We're tea leaf reading like everyone else,"" one White House official said.
In the meantime, the White House's special counsel Emmett Flood and his team charged with responding to Mueller's inquiries have prepared possible responses from the White House to whatever becomes public.
Flood and his team have gamed out the outlines of how the White House would react to different scenarios, based on the extent of Attorney General Bill Barr's disclosure to Congress and whether the findings are exculpatory or damaging to the President.
The White House press shop, meanwhile, is on alert, but has largely kept its distance from preparations related to the Mueller report. A senior White House official told CNN earlier this month that the White House has, however, mulled the possibility of responding to the report with a statement from the President or White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, depending on the outcome.
Whatever the preparations, White House officials know that Trump could decide to act on his own -- taking to his favorite social medium, Twitter, to hail or attack the conclusions of the investigation.
The Trump campaign -- which has recently beefed up its communications team to include a research director and head of surrogates -- is also prepared to dive in and respond to whatever surfaces.
""We will be prepared and we anticipate that the reports will exonerate the President and demonstrate that there wasn't any collusion,"" a senior Trump campaign official said. ""The campaign will be naturally involved and engaged in responding to the report.""
""We will be aggressively responding,"" the official added.
Some in the President's political orbit have begun to believe -- and hope -- that the Mueller report will be good news for the President, granting him the exoneration that Trump has so desperately sought since the Justice Department began to probe allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
""This clears the decks for us,"" a Trump campaign adviser said, expressing hope for an exculpatory outcome.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - The risk of floods has forced the Iranian government to order the evacuation of 70 villages in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan on Tuesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. 
The villages were close to the Dez and Karkheh rivers, Shush county governor Adnan Qazi said, quoted by IRNA. 
At least 45 people were killed in the past two weeks in flash floods in northern and southern Iran after the heaviest rains in at least a decade. 
Iran has announced a state of emergency in southern provinces threatened by flooding and has evacuated dozens of villages already.  
Floods have affected at least 23 out of Iran’s 31 provinces since heavy downpours began on March 19.

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s easternmost province of Papua is planning to hold mass burials for the victims of flash floods, as the death toll from the disaster rose to 104 on Wednesday with nearly 10,000 people displaced, the disaster mitigation agency said. 
The floods and landslides injured 160 people, 85 of them seriously, while 79 people were missing, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency. 
After consulting families and churches, a mass funeral for the victims would be held on Thursday, he said. 
The floods and landslide struck at the weekend near the provincial capital of Jayapura after torrential rain fell across the Cyclops mountain range, much of which has been stripped of trees by villagers chopping fire wood and farmers cultivating plantations. 
Disaster authorities had warned provincial officials of the danger of flash floods due to deforestation. 
Fourteen excavators had been deployed to help clear blocked roads, while temporary bridges were also being built in some areas after access had been cut. 
The nearly 10,000 displaced people were scattered across 18 relief shelters and they would be moved to six camps to help streamline aid distribution, the spokesman said.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Flooding has caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to Iranian agriculture, an official said on Thursday, as the speaker of parliament questioned whether government funds would be adequate to compensate affected communities and farmers. 
About 1,900 cities and villages have been affected by floods and exceptionally heavy rains that began on March 19. 
The disaster, which has so far killed 62 people, has left aid agencies struggling to cope and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters provided by the government. 
Early estimates put flood losses in agriculture sector at 47 trillion rials (about $350 million), the head of the agriculture ministry’s crisis management, Mohammad Mousavi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA, based on the unofficial exchange rate of 135,000 rials to a dollar. 
The government has assured citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all their losses will be compensated, but the speaker of parliament said on Thursday the new year budget would not suffice to cover the damages. The speaker, Ali Larijani, said the government should seek other resources. 
Iran’s operating budget is already stretched under a new round of U.S. sanctions on Iranian energy and banking sectors that have halved its oil exports and restricted its access to some revenues abroad. 
President Hassan Rouhani, whose critics have accused him of mismanaging the emergency response to the disaster, said on Wednesday the sanctions were also hampering efforts to deliver aid. 
The lawmakers have summoned several ministers to parliament on Sunday to explain why preventative measures were not in place to save lives and limit suffering. At least 26 of Iran’s 31 provinces have been affected. 
As waters continue to submerge villages, the government said it had deployed more mobile medical units to southern provinces. Around 1,000 people have been airlifted by emergency helicopters to safety in recent days. 
The head of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards reiterated that the forces “were using all their power” to minimize the damages in oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan province. 
Iranian drilling companies and other energy firms have been assisting rescue efforts in flooded areas, notably using their pumps to remove water. 
Rising water, mudslides and rockslide have blocked 36 roads across the country. Many flights and trains have also been affected. 
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has released around 500,000 Swiss francs ($500,000) as cash grants for 3,000 Iranian families that have lost homes and livelihoods in the floods.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister on Wednesday urged local oil and gas firms to help with providing aid to victims of severe flooding, as one international aid agency announced extra funds to bolster relief efforts. 
At least 26 of Iran’s 31 provinces have been hit by heavy downpours that began on March 19. The flooding - the country’s worst in a decade - has killed 62 people, the head of crisis management at the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization said on Wednesday, according to student news agency ISNA. 
A state of emergency was declared in several provinces including oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan, where state news agency IRNA said 70 villages were ordered evacuated on Tuesday. 
Iranian drilling companies and other energy firms have been assisting rescue efforts in flooded areas, notably using their pumps to remove water. 
But minister Bijan Zanganeh suggested they should do more. 
“Along with performing their essential duties, (firms in the sector) should use all of their existing capabilities to help the people and reduce the flood waters,” he said on the ministry’s newsfeed. 
Western oil and gas firms have been forced to pull out of Iran since Washington last year reimposed economic sanctions after quitting a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. 
President Hassan Rouhani, whose critics have accused him of mismanaging the emergency response to the disaster, on Wednesday said the sanctions were hampering efforts to deliver aid, echoing comments by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied that contention on Tuesday, saying Washington was ready to help via the Red Cross and Red Crescent and blaming Iran’s clerical establishment for the scale of the disaster. 
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said it had released just under 500,000 Swiss francs ($500,000) as cash grants for 3,000 Iranian families that have lost homes and livelihoods in the floods. 
“Iran is under water. This is an unprecedented crisis ...The Red Crescent response is massive, and it is growing every day,” said IFRC Middle East and North Africa director Sayed Hashem in a statement.

"Tens of thousands of people were without power in Washington state Tuesday as snow turned to rain in many parts of the Pacific Northwest. Warming temperatures brought relief but also new concerns, as heavy tree branches snapped and contributed to power outages and road closures.
There were also concerns about flooding. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for parts of Washington and northwest Oregon through Wednesday morning.
Spokane and much of northeastern Washington remained under a winter storm warning on Tuesday, with 3 to 6 inches of new snow expected to fall in the region, the weather service said. Overnight, 5 inches of snow fell in the Spokane region, turning the streets into a slippery mess and prompting numerous school districts to cancel classes for the day.

"Randy Buckner was a graduate student at Washington University in st. Louis in 1991 when he stumbled across one of the most important discoveries of modern brain science. For Buckner — as for many of his peers during the early ’90s — the discovery was so counterintuitive that it took years to recognize its significance. Buckner’s lab, run by the neuroscientists Marcus Raichle and Steven Petersen, was exploring what the new technology of PET scanning could show about the connection between language and memory in the human brain. The promise of the PET machine lay in how it measured blood flow to different parts of the brain, allowing researchers for the first time to see detailed neural activity, not just anatomy. In Buckner’s study, the subjects were asked to recall words from a memorized list; by tracking where the brain was consuming the most energy during the task, Buckner and his colleagues hoped to understand which parts of the brain were engaged in that kind of memory. But there was a catch. Different regions of the brain vary widely in how much energy they consume no matter what the brain is doing; if you ask someone to do mental math while scanning her brain in a PET machine, you won’t learn anything from that scan on its own, because the subtle changes that reflect the mental math task will be drowned out by the broader patterns of blood flow throughout the brain. To see the specific regions activated by a specific task, researchers needed a baseline comparison, a control. At first, this seemed simple enough: Put the subjects in the PET scanner, ask them to sit there and do nothing — what the researchers sometimes called a resting state — and then ask them to perform the task under study. The assumption was that by comparing the two images, the resting brain and the active brain, the researchers could discern which regions were consuming more energy while performing the task. But something went strangely wrong when Buckner scanned the resting states of their subjects. “What happened is that we began putting people in scanners that can measure their brain activity,” Buckner recalls now, “and Mother Nature shouted back at us.” When people were told to sit and do nothing, the PET scans showed a distinct surge of mental energy in some regions. The resting state turned out to be more active than the active state. The odd blast of activity during the resting state would be observed in dozens of other studies using a similar control structure during this period. To this first generation of scientists using PET scans, the active rest state was viewed, in Buckner’s words, as “a confound, as troublesome.” A confound is an errant variable that prevents a scientist from doing a proper control study. It’s noise, mere interference getting in the way of the signal that science is looking for. Buckner and his colleagues noted the strange activity in a paper submitted in 1993, but almost as an afterthought, or an apology. But that passing nod to the strangely active “resting state” turned out to be one of the first hints of what would become a revolution in our understanding of human intelligence. Not long after Buckner’s paper was published, a brain scientist at the University of Iowa named Nancy Andreasen decided to invert the task/control structure that had dominated the early neuroimaging studies. Instead of battling the “troublesome” resting state, Andreasen and her team would make it the focus of their study. Andreasen’s background outside neuroscience might have helped her perceive the value lurking in the rest state, where her peers saw only trouble. As a professor of Renaissance literature, she published a scholarly appraisal of John Donne’s “conservative revolutionary” poetics. After switching fields in her 30s, she eventually began exploring the mystery of creativity through the lens of brain imaging. “Although neither a Freudian nor a psychoanalyst, I knew enough about human mental activity to quickly perceive what a foolish ‘control task’ rest was,” she would later write. “Most investigators made the convenient assumption that the brain would be blank or neutral during ‘rest.’ From introspection I knew that my own brain is often at its most active when I stretch out on a bed or sofa and close my eyes.” Andreasen’s study, the results of which were eventually published in The American Journal of Psychiatry in 1995, included a subtle dig at the way the existing community had demoted this state to a baseline control: She called this mode the REST state, for Random Episodic Silent Thought. The surge of activity that the PET scans revealed was not a confound, Andreasen argued. It was a clue. In our resting states, we do not rest. Left to its own devices, the human brain resorts to one of its most emblematic tricks, maybe one that helped make us human in the first place. It time-travels. Imagine it’s late evening on a workday and you’re taking your dog for a walk before bedtime. A few dozen paces from your front door, as you settle into your usual route through the neighborhood, your mind wanders to an important meeting scheduled for next week. You picture it going well — there’s a subtle rush of anticipatory pleasure as you imagine the scene — and you allow yourself to hope that this might set the stage for you to ask your boss for a raise. Not right away, mind you, but maybe in a few months. You imagine her saying yes, and what that salary bump would mean: Next year, you and your spouse might finally be able to get out of the rental market and buy a house in a nicer neighborhood nearby, the one with the better school district. But then your mind shifts to a problem you’ve been wrestling with lately: A member of your team is brilliant but temperamental. His emotional swings can be explosive; just today, perceiving a slight from a colleague, he started berating her in the middle of a meeting. He seems to have no sense of decorum, no ability to rein in his emotions. As you walk, you remember the physical sense of unease in the room as your colleague ranted over the most meaningless offense. You imagine a meeting six months from now with a comparable eruption — only this time it’s happening in front of your boss. A small wave of stress washes over you. Perhaps he’s just not the right fit for the job, you think — which reminds you of the one time you fired an employee, five years ago. Your mind conjures the awkward intensity of that conversation, and then imagines how much more explosive a comparable conversation would be with your current employee. You feel a sensation close to physical fear as your mind runs through the scenario. In just a few minutes of mental wandering, you have made several distinct round trips from past to future: forward a week to the important meeting, forward a year or more to the house in the new neighborhood, backward five hours to today’s meeting, forward six months, backward five years, forward a few weeks. You’ve built chains of cause and effect connecting those different moments; you’ve moved seamlessly from actual events to imagined ones. And as you’ve navigated through time, your brain and body’s emotional system has generated distinct responses to each situation, real and imagined. The whole sequence is a master class in temporal gymnastics. In these moments of unstructured thinking, our minds dart back and forth between past and future, like a film editor scrubbing through the frames of a movie. The sequence of thoughts does not feel, subjectively, like hard work. It does not seem to require mental effort; the scenarios just flow out of your mind. Because these imagined futures come so easily to us, we have long underestimated the significance of the skill. The PET scanner allowed us to appreciate, for the first time, just how complex this kind of cognitive time travel actually is. In her 1995 paper, Nancy Andreasen included two key observations that would grow in significance over the subsequent decades. When she interviewed the subjects afterward, they described their mental activity during the REST state as a kind of effortless shifting back and forth in time. “They think freely about a variety of things,” Andreasen wrote, “especially events of the past few days or future activities of the current or next several days.” Perhaps most intriguing, Andreasen noted that most of the REST activity took place in what are called the association cortices of the brain, the regions of the brain that are most pronounced in Homo sapiens compared with other primates and that are often the last to become fully operational as the human brain develops through adolescence and early adulthood. “Apparently, when the brain/mind thinks in a free and unencumbered fashion,” she wrote, “it uses its most human and complex parts.” In the years that followed Andreasen’s pioneering work, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of studies and papers mapped out the network of brain activity that she first identified. In 2001, Randy Buckner’s adviser at Washington University, Marcus Raichle, coined a new term for the phenomenon: the “default-mode network,” or just “the default network.” The phrase stuck. Today, Google Scholar lists thousands of academic studies that have investigated the default network. “It looks to me like this is the most important discovery of cognitive neuroscience,” says the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman. The seemingly trivial activity of mind-wandering is now believed to play a central role in the brain’s “deep learning,” the mind’s sifting through past experiences, imagining future prospects and assessing them with emotional judgments: that flash of shame or pride or anxiety that each scenario elicits. A growing number of scholars, drawn from a wide swath of disciplines — neuroscience, philosophy, computer science — now argue that this aptitude for cognitive time travel, revealed by the discovery of the default network, may be the defining property of human intelligence. “What best distinguishes our species,” Seligman wrote in a Times Op-Ed with John Tierney, “is an ability that scientists are just beginning to appreciate: We contemplate the future.” He went on: “A more apt name for our species would be Homo prospectus, because we thrive by considering our prospects. The power of prospection is what makes us wise.” It is unclear whether nonhuman animals have any real concept of the future at all. Some organisms display behavior that has long-term consequences, like a squirrel’s burying a nut for winter, but those behaviors are all instinctive. The latest studies of animal cognition suggest that some primates and birds may carry out deliberate preparations for events that will occur in the near future. But making decisions based on future prospects on the scale of months or years — even something as simple as planning a gathering of the tribe a week from now — would be unimaginable even to our closest primate relatives. If the Homo prospectus theory is correct, those limited time-traveling skills explain an important piece of the technological gap that separates humans from all other species on the planet. It’s a lot easier to invent a new tool if you can imagine a future where that tool might be useful. What gave flight to the human mind and all its inventiveness may not have been the usual culprits of our opposable thumbs or our gift for language. It may, instead, have been freeing our minds from the tyranny of the present. The capacity for prospection has been reflected in, and amplified by, many of the social and scientific revolutions that shaped human history. Agriculture itself would have been unimaginable without a working model of the future: predicting seasonal changes, visualizing the long-term improvements possible from domesticating crops. Banking and credit systems require minds capable of sacrificing present-tense value for the possibility of greater gains in the future. For vaccines to work, we needed patients willing to introduce a potential pathogen into their bodies for a lifetime of protection against disease. We are born with a singular gift for imagining the future, but we have been enhancing those gifts since the dawn of civilization. Today, new enhancements are on the horizon, in the form of machine-learning algorithms that already outperform humans at certain kinds of forecasts. As A.I. stands poised to augment our most essential human talent, we are faced with a curious question: How will the future be different if we get much better at predicting it? “Time travel feels like an ancient tradition, rooted in old mythologies, old as gods and dragons,” James Gleick observes in his 2017 book, “Time Travel: A History.” “It isn’t. Though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead, time machines were beyond their ken. Time travel is a fantasy of the modern era.” The idea of using technology to move through time as effortlessly as we move through space appears to have been first conceived by H.G. Wells at the end of the 19th century, eventually showcased in his pioneering work of science fiction, “The Time Machine.” But machines have been soothsayers from the beginning. In 1900, sponge divers stranded after a storm in the Mediterranean discovered an underwater statuary on the shoals of the Greek island Antikythera. It turned out to be the wreck of a ship more than 2,000 years old. During the subsequent salvage operation, divers recovered the remnants of a puzzling clocklike contraption with precision-cut gears, annotated with cryptic symbols that were corroded beyond recognition. For years, the device lay unnoticed in a museum drawer, until a British historian named Derek de Solla Price rediscovered it in the early 1950s and began the laborious process of reconstructing it — an effort that scholars have continued into the 21st century. We now know that the device was capable of predicting the behavior of the sun, the moon and five of the planets. The device was so advanced that it could even predict, with meaningful accuracy, solar or lunar eclipses that wouldn’t occur for decades. The Antikythera mechanism, as it has come to be known, is sometimes referred to as an ancient computer. The analogy is misleading: The underlying technology behind the device was much closer to a clock than a programmable computer. But at its essence, it was a prediction machine. A clock is there to tell you about the present. The mechanism was there to tell you about the future. That its creators went to such great lengths to predict eclipses seems telling: While some ancient societies did believe that eclipses harmed crops, knowing about them in advance wouldn’t have been of much use. What seems far more useful is the sense of magic and wonder that such a prediction could provide, and the power that could be acquired as a result. Imagine standing in front of the masses and announcing that tomorrow the sun will transform for more than a minute into a fire-tinged black orb. Then imagine the awe when the prophecy comes true. Prediction machines have only multiplied since the days of the ancient Greeks. Where those original clockwork devices dealt with deterministic futures, like the motions of solar bodies, increasingly our time-traveling tools forecast probabilities and likelihoods, allowing us to imagine possible futures for more complex systems. In the late 1600s, thanks to improvements in public-health records and mathematical advances in statistics, the British astronomer Edmund Halley and the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens separately made the first rigorous estimates of average life expectancy. Around the same time, there was an explosion of insurance companies, their business made possible by this newfound ability to predict future risk. Initially, they focused on the commercial risk of new shipping ventures, but eventually insurance would come to offer protection against just about every future threat imaginable: fire, floods, disease. In the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials allowed us to predict the future effects of medical interventions, finally separating out the genuine cures from the snake oil. In the digital age, spreadsheet software took accounting tools that were originally designed to record the past activity of a business and transformed them into tools for projecting out forecasts, letting us click through alternate financial scenarios in much the way our minds wander through various possible futures. But cognitive time travel has been enhanced by more than just science and technology. The invention of storytelling itself can be seen as a kind of augmentation of the default network’s gift for time travel. Stories do not just allow us to conjure imaginary worlds; they also free us from being mired in linear time. Analepsis and prolepsis — flashbacks and flash-forwards — constitute some of the oldest literary devices in the canon, deployed in ancient narratives like the “Odyssey” and the “Arabian Nights.” Time machines have obviously proliferated in the content of sci-fi narratives since “The Time Machine” was published, but time travel has also infiltrated the form of modern storytelling. A defining trick of recent popular narrative is the contorted timeline, with movies and TV shows embracing temporal schemes that would have baffled mainstream audiences just a few decades ago. The epic, often inscrutable plot of the TV show “Lost” veered among past, present and future with a reckless glee. The blockbuster 2016 movie “Arrival” featured a bewildering time scheme that skipped forward more than 50 times to future events, while intimating throughout that they were actually occurring in the past. The current hit series “This Is Us” reinvented the family-soap-opera genre by structuring each episode as a series of time-jumps, sometimes spanning more than 50 years. The final five minutes of the Season 3 opener, which aired earlier this fall, jump back and forth seven times among 1974, 2018 and some unspecified future that looks to be about 2028. These narrative developments suggest an intriguing possibility: that popular entertainment is training our minds to get better at cognitive time travel. If you borrowed Wells’s time machine and jumped back to 1955, then asked typical viewers of “Gunsmoke” and “I Love Lucy” to watch “Arrival” or “Lost,” they would have found the temporal high jinks deeply disorienting. Back then, even a single flashback required extra hand-holding — remember the rippling screen? — to signify the temporal leap. Only experimental narratives dared challenge the audience with more complex time schemes. Today’s popular narratives zip around their fictional timelines with the speed of the default network itself. The elaborate timelines of popular narrative may be training our minds to contemplate more complex temporal schemes, but could new technology augment our skills more directly? We have long heard promises of “smart drugs” on the horizon that will enhance our memory, but if the Homo prospectus argument is correct, we should probably be looking for breakthroughs that will enhance our predictive powers as well. In a way, those advances are already around us, but in the form of software, not pharmaceuticals. If you have ever found yourself mentally running through alternate possibilities for a coming outing — what happens if it rains? — based on a 10-day weather forecast, your prospective powers have been enhanced by the time-traveling skills of climate supercomputers that churn through billions of alternative atmospheric scenarios, drawn from the past and projecting out into the future. These visualizations are giving you, for the first time in human history, better-than-random predictions about what the weather will be like in a week’s time. Or say that dream neighborhood you’re thinking about moving to — the one you can finally afford if you manage to get that raise — happens to sit in a flood zone, and you think about what it might be like to live through a significant flood event 10 years from now, as the climate becomes increasingly unpredictable. That you’re even contemplating that possibility is almost entirely thanks to the long-term simulations of climate supercomputers, metabolizing the planet’s deep past into its distant future. Accurate weather forecasting is merely one early triumph of software-based time travel: algorithms that allow us to peer into the future in ways that were impossible just a few decades ago, what a new book by a trio of University of Toronto economists calls “prediction machines.” In machine-learning systems, algorithms can be trained to generate remarkably accurate predictions of future events by combing through vast repositories of data from past events. An algorithm might be trained to predict future mortgage defaults by analyzing thousands of home purchases and the financial profiles of the buyers, testing its hypotheses by tracking which of those buyers ultimately defaulted. A result of that training would not be an infallible prediction, of course, but something similar to the predictions we rely on with weather forecasts: a range of probabilities. That time-traveling exercise, in which you imagine buying a house in the neighborhood with the great schools, could be augmented by a software prediction as well: The algorithm might warn you that there was a 20 percent chance that your home purchase would end catastrophically, because of a market crash or a hurricane. Or another algorithm, trained on a different data set, might suggest other neighborhoods where home values are also likely to increase. These algorithms can help correct a critical flaw in the default network: Human beings are famously bad at thinking probabilistically. The pioneering cognitive psychologist Amos Tversky once joked that where probability is concerned, humans have three default settings: “gonna happen,” “not gonna happen” and “maybe.” We are brilliant at floating imagined scenarios and evaluating how they might make us feel, were they to happen. But distinguishing between a 20 percent chance of something happening and a 40 percent chance doesn’t come naturally to us. Algorithms can help us compensate for that cognitive blind spot. Machine-learning systems will also be immensely helpful when mulling decisions that potentially involve a large number of distinct options. Humans are remarkably adept at building imagined futures for a few competing timelines simultaneously: the one in which you take the new job, the one in which you turn it down. But our minds run up against a computational ceiling when they need to track dozens or hundreds of future trajectories. The prediction machines of A.I. do not have that limitation, which will make them tantalizingly adept at assisting with some meaningful subset of important life decisions in which there is rich training data and a high number of alternate futures to analyze. Choosing where to go to college — a decision almost no human being had to make 200 years ago that more than a third of the planet now does — happens to be a decision that resides squarely in the machine-learning sweet spot. There are more than 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States. A great majority of them are obviously inappropriate for any individual candidate. But no matter where you are on the ladder of academic achievement — and economic privilege — there are undoubtedly more than a few dozen candidate colleges that might well lead to interesting outcomes for you. You can visit a handful of them, and listen to the wisdom of your advisers, and consult the college experts online or in their handbooks. But the algorithm would be scanning a much larger set of options: looking at data from millions of applications, college transcripts, dropout rates, all the information that can be gleaned from the social-media presence of college students (which is, today, just about everything). It would also scan a parallel data set that the typical college adviser rarely emphasizes: successful career paths that bypassed college. From that training set it could generate dozens of separate predictions for promising colleges, optimized to whatever rough goals the applicant defined: self-reported long-term happiness, financial security, social-justice impact, fame, health. To be clear, that data will be abused, sold off to advertisers or stolen by cyberthieves; it will generate a thousand appropriately angry op-eds. But it will also most likely work on some basic level, to the best that we’ll be able to measure. Some people will swear by it; others will renounce it. Either way, it’s coming. In late 2017, the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago announced a new collaboration with the Chicago Police Department to build a machine-learning-based “officer support system,” designed specifically to predict which officers are likely to have an “adverse incident” on the job. The algorithm sifts through the prodigious repository of data generated by every cop on the beat in Chicago: arrest reports, gun confiscations, public complaints, supervisor reprimands and more. The algorithm uses archived data — coupled with actual cases of adverse incidents, like the shooting of an unarmed citizen or other excessive uses of force — as a training set, enabling it to detect patterns of information that can predict future problems. This sort of predictive technology immediately conjures images of a “Minority Report”-style dystopia, in which the machines convict you of a precrime that by definition hasn’t happened yet. But the project lead, Jens Ludwig, points out that with a predictive system like the one currently in the works in Chicago, the immediate consequence would simply be an officer’s getting some additional support or counseling, to help avert a larger crisis. “People get understandably nervous about A.I. making the final decision,” Ludwig says. “But we don’t envision that A.I. would be making the decision.” Instead, he imagines it as a “decision-making aid” — an algorithm that “can help sergeants prioritize their attention.” No matter how careful the Chicago P.D. is in deploying this particular technology, we shouldn’t sugarcoat the broader implications here: It seems inevitable that people will be fired thanks to the predictive insights of machine-learning algorithms, and something about that prospect is intuitively disturbing to many of us. Yet we’re already making consequential decisions about people — whom to hire, whom to fire, whom to listen to, whom to ignore — based on human biases that we know to be at best unreliable, at worst prejudiced. If it seems creepy to imagine that we would make them based on data-analyzing algorithms, the decision-making status quo, relying on our meanest instincts, may well be far creepier. Whether you find the idea of augmenting the default network thrilling or terrifying, one thing should be clear: These tools are headed our way. In the coming decade, many of us will draw on the forecasts of machine learning to help us muddle through all kinds of life decisions: career changes, financial planning, hiring choices. These enhancements could well turn out to be the next leap forward in the evolution of Homo prospectus, allowing us to see into the future with more acuity — and with a more nuanced sense of probability — than we can do on our own. But even in that optimistic situation, the power embedded in these new algorithms will be extraordinary, which is why Ludwig and many other members of the A.I. community have begun arguing for the creation of open-source algorithms, not unlike the open protocols of the original internet and World Wide Web. Drawing on predictive algorithms to shape important personal or civic decisions will be challenging enough without the process’s potentially being compromised or subtly redirected by the dictates of advertisers. If you thought Russian troll farms were dangerous in our social-media feeds, imagine what will happen when they infiltrate our daydreams. Today, it seems, mind-wandering is under attack from all sides. It’s a common complaint that our compulsive use of smartphones is destroying our ability to focus. But seen through the lens of Homo prospectus, ubiquitous computing poses a different kind of threat: Having a network-connected supercomputer in your pocket at all times gives you too much to focus on. It cuts into your mind-wandering time. The downtime between cognitively active tasks that once led to REST states can now be filled with Instagram, or Nasdaq updates, or podcasts. We have Twitter timelines instead of time travel. At the same time, a society-wide vogue for “mindfulness” encourages us to be in the moment, to think of nothing at all instead of letting our thoughts wander. Search YouTube, and there are hundreds of meditation videos teaching you how to stop your mind from doing what it does naturally. The Homo prospectus theory suggests that, if anything, we need to carve out time in our schedule — and perhaps even in our schools — to let minds drift. According to Marcus Raichle at Washington University, it may not be too late to repair whatever damage we may have done to our prospective powers. A few early studies suggest that the neurons implicated in the default network have genetic profiles that are often associated with long-term brain plasticity, that most treasured of neural attributes. “The brain’s default-mode network appears to preserve the capacity for plasticity into adulthood,” he told me. Plasticity, of course, is just another way of saying that the network can learn new tricks. If these new studies pan out, our mind-wandering skills will not have been locked into place in our childhood. We can get better at daydreaming, if we give ourselves the time to do it. What will happen to our own time-traveling powers as we come to rely more on the prediction machines of A.I.? The outcome may be terrifying, or liberating, or some strange hybrid of the two. Right now it seems inevitable that A.I. will transform our prospective powers in meaningful new ways, for better or for worse. But it would be nice to think that all the technology that helped us understand the default network in the first place also ended up pushing us back to our roots: giving our minds more time to wander, to slip the surly bonds of now, to be out of the moment.",Looking to the future has always defined humanity. Will A.I. become the best crystal ball of all?,2018-11-15T15:49:54Z,The Human Brain Is a Time Traveler,The New York Times,0
"Parts of Northern California are coping with the worst flooding there in more than two decades. Floodwaters from the Russian River carried away vehicles in the resort town of Guerneville north of San Francisco. Thousands of people are trapped.
The Russian River crested Wednesday night at 46 feet -- 13 feet over flood stage. CBS News' Meg Oliver reports from Hacienda, California, an area completely cut off by the flooding. The river has risen so high, we won't know the full extent of the damage until floodwaters begin to recede.
The only way to get in and out of Guerneville is by kayak or canoe. When the Russian River overflowed, it inundated the small town, surrounding homes with water, submerging cars and trapping anyone who didn't get out. 
 More than two dozen towns along a 25-mile stretch of the river were evacuated. Along with Guerneville, Monte Rio is now also essentially an island and nearly 100 roads in Sonoma County are closed. An area weather station recorded more than 20 inches of rain over the past three days. 
Floodwaters stranded at least 2,000 people in Guerneville, where the water came up so high it reached the roof of an RV. 
 Emergency crews have been forced to prioritize those who are in immediate danger.
""We are not going to be rescuing people unless there is an imminent life safety threat. So people are just going to have to be patient,"" said Sonoma County emergency manager Chris Godley. 
 Rachel Vasquez didn't think the floodwaters would reach her home. Now she's waiting out the disaster with her four kids. She said she and her family should hopefully be OK.  
Sonoma County has urged the governor of California to declare a state of emergency. While the water is beginning to recede, even more rain is expected later this week.","Floodwaters stranded at least 2,000 people in Guerneville, where the water came up so high it reached the roof of an RV",2019-02-28T10:51:10Z,Devastating floodwaters cut off entire towns in Northern California,CBS News,1

A good part of the country was facing dangerous winter weather on Friday as people hit the roads and took to the sky during a busy holiday travel week.
The majority of New Mexico was blanketed in a winter storm warning, according to the National Weather Service, which said heavy winds could create blizzard conditions in parts of the state, and that 2 feet could accumulate in some areas.
Towns outside of Albuquerque, which was under its first-ever blizzard warning, were reporting 16 inches of snow Friday morning. The city usually averages fewer than 3 inches of snow in the entire month of December, and the snowfall record for Dec. 28 is 4.9 inches.
Parts of Texas, Colorado, and Arizona were also under winter weather advisories.
In the Midwest where snow and winds created havoc on the roads Thursday the storm has calmed, but highways were still iced over in states like Minnesota, the Dakotas and Kansas that had areas seeing up to a foot of snow.
Parts of Minnesota were still under no travel advisories Friday morning, according to the state patrol.
One person was killed and nine others were injured when an SUV collided with a small bus carrying eight adults on a slick highway near Big Lake, about 40 miles north of Minneapolis, according to the Sherburne County Sheriff's Office.
In Kansas, a 16-year-old boy was killed and three other people were seriously injured when a semitrailer pinned an SUV against a guardrail on an iced-over section of I-70 Thursday, according to the Kansas Highway Patrol.
Parts of the Southeast had already picked up 6-12 inches of rain overnight Thursday. In Tennessee, a 30-year-old woman's body was discovered Friday after she was swept away by flood waters the night before, NBC affiliate WRCB reported.
Travel wasn't proving to be much easier on roads and skies in the east, from the Gulf Coast through the Carolinas and up toward the Northeast, as heavy rain fell. More than 100 flights at Atlanta International Airport and dozens at Charlotte Douglas International Airport were delayed on Friday morning in the soggy weather.

Heavy winds and pounding rains were turning the Friday before Christmas considered one of the busiest travel days of the year into a wintry mess for millions of Americans hitting the roads or scrambling to catch flights.
Already Friday morning, hundreds of flights were canceled and thousands delayed across the United States. Morning commutes were especially miserable on the East Coast, with about 60 million people from North Carolina to Maine under flash flood warnings, forecasters said. By Saturday morning, some areas could see up to 5 inches of rain.
Flooding was also expected to hit the northern coast of South Carolina to coastal Massachusetts, according to reports.
On Friday morning, northern Florida to Maine were under wind advisories, with cities such as Boston and New York expected to see gusts of up to 45 mph and 60 mph for some coastal areas.
But despite the poor conditions, people in parts of the East Coast, from Florida to New York, saw temperatures hit a balmy 60 degrees.

Elsewhere, the rain was expected to end in Atlanta by Friday night, and in Washington, D.C., by 3 a.m. ET Saturday. Rain will continue in New York and Boston into Saturday.
Parts of the West Coast were expected to see rain through Christmas Day, Accuweather reported, and forecasters said the worst would hit the Northwest.
""While the strongest storm in the series has moved out and waves have eased a bit, expect additional rounds of heavy seas, rough surf, coastal flooding and beach erosion to continue in the coming days,"" said AccuWeather meteorologist Max Vido.
The weather has also caused major flight delays, with about 2,000 affected throughout the country on Friday morning and more than 200 flights canceled, according to FlightAware.com.
United Airlines said Friday morning that it was issuing travel waivers for people experiencing delays at New Jersey- and New York-area airports. The waivers were for affected travelers going to and from those airports or catching a connecting flight.
JetBlue also posted on its website that it would ""waive change/cancel fees and fare differences"" for customers traveling to and from New York and New Jersey.

OMAHA, Neb. Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
The scramble to move people out of harm's way was expected to subside going into the new week, as rivers and creeks in flooded eastern Nebraska and western Iowa were expected to crest Saturday and Sunday. That left officials downstream looking to prepare for likely flooding.

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson had already met with emergency management team members Friday to review and update flood-response plans, and the Missouri Highway Patrol was preparing additional equipment and putting swift water rescue personnel on standby. The Missouri National Guard also temporarily relocated the 139th Airlift Wing's C-130s from Rosecrans Air National Guard Base in St. Joseph as a precaution.
The National Weather Service said the Missouri River at St. Joseph reached nearly 26 feet on Saturday, about a foot below what's considered major flooding at the northwest Missouri city. But it's expected to crest Wednesday or Thursday at 29.3 feet more than two feet above major flooding level.
Evacuation efforts in eastern Nebraska and some spots in western Iowa on Saturday were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. In Fremont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriff's Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River. And in Mills County, Iowa, authorities ordered people in some rural areas to evacuate after the Missouri River overtopped levees.

 Gov. Pete Ricketts (@GovRicketts) March 16, 2019
The flooding followed days of snow and rain record-setting, in some places that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilke's death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Fremont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
""There is no way out of here unless you've got a helicopter or a boat,"" the Rev. Mike Bitter, pastor of Christian Church of Waterloo, told the Omaha World-Herald.
Officials in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska were urging people not to drive unless necessary. In Iowa, a section of northbound Interstate 29 that runs parallel to the Missouri River was closed due to flooding. Authorities were rerouting motorists at Kansas City, Missouri, using a detour that took people almost 140 miles (225 kilometers) out of the way.

Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Service's Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
""What we're having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event that's going to happen in early April,"" he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.
Freeport resident Mary Martin told the (Freeport) Journal-Standard that she went to the store to get milk and bread when she saw floodwaters were rising Friday.
""Within an hour of going to the store, I could not get back in. That's how fast the water was coming up,"" Martin said.","Flooding in Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest have prompted authorities to use boats for rescues, and some areas were evacuated.",2019-03-17T02:03:00Z,"Midwest flooding prompts rescues, evacuations",NBC News,1

Parts of the United States will see snowfall this Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but the real winter weather this year could come after the holiday, forecasters say.
Across the country, more than 2 million people are under winter weather alerts through mid-Christmas Day, according to the National Weather Service and Weather.com.
In New England, parts of central and western New York and eastern Pennsylvania, a light dusting of snow is expected on Monday. It's unclear if the dusting will hold over until Christmas morning.
The heaviest snowfall in the region will happen near the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where winter weather advisories are in effect until 10 p.m. ET. Accumulations in the area could reach 5 to 6 inches.
Farther northeast, snow squalls are possible Monday afternoon, which could inhibit some holiday travel due to low visibility.
Out west, the northern Cascades to central Sierra Nevada stretching from Oregon into eastern California and northern Nevada could receive 3 to 5 inches from a winter storm. The highest snowfall in this region will be at the Sierra Nevada's highest altitude, where 20 inches of new snow could fall through the afternoon of Christmas Day.
Heavy rain is also a threat out west. The Washington coast, northern Oregon coast and the Bay Area of California are under coastal flood advisories through 11 a.m. PST Monday.
That storm system is likely to move eastward through the Plains, upper Midwest and northern New England Wednesday through Friday, according to Weather.com.
Temperatures at the end of the week will be low enough on the storm's north side to generate snowfall from the northern and central Plains into the upper Midwest and northern Great Lakes region, Weather.com reported. That storm system, mixed with strong winds, could cause near-blizzard conditions.

GUERNEVILLE, Calif. Floodwaters that turned two Northern California communities into islands were expected to begin receding Thursday as a rain-engorged river finally peaked after swamping thousands of homes, businesses and other buildings.
The Russian River in the wine country north of San Francisco crested at more than 46 feet Wednesday night, Sonoma County officials said.
The river frequently floods in rainy weather but it hadn't reached that level for 25 years and wasn't expected to recede again until late Thursday night.
The estimated 2,000 buildings inundated by floodwaters were mainly in and around Guerneville, Khan said.
""Guerneville has essentially become an island,"" Khan said. The nearby town of Monte Rio also was isolated when roads leading to it were swamped.
No injuries were reported and by Wednesday night the rain had eased but about 3,500 people in two dozen river communities remained under evacuation orders.
In addition, two sewage treatment plants weren't working, leading to concerns about potential sewage spills, she added.

The river was one of several in Northern California that was engorged by days of rain from western U.S. storms that also dumped heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada, throughout the Pacific Northwest and into Montana, where Gov. Steve Bullock signed an emergency order to help keep up the supply of heating fuel amid frigid temperatures.
Two Amtrak trains together carrying nearly 300 passengers stopped and reversed directions because of an avalanche that closed railroad tracks in the Sierra Nevada.
In Idaho, the mountain town of Stanley became marooned Wednesday after all three highways leading to the town were closed because of drifting snow, avalanches and the risk of more slides.
Several areas in California set record-high rainfall totals, including nearby Santa Rosa, which had nearly 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in one day. The often-waterlogged Venado weather station 5 miles from Guerneville recorded more than 20 inches of rain in 48 hours.
Dozens of people were rescued from cars that became stranded Tuesday and early Wednesday after drivers tried to cross flooded roads.
Nina Sheehan, who is visiting from North Carolina, had to abandon her rental SUV after it got stuck in a flooded hotel parking lot.
""We made a decision to take the rental car through the waist-high water and we got two thirds of the way and then the car stalled,"" she said.

Rhondell Rasmus had pulled to the side of a road too flooded to cross in Sebastopol in Sonoma County late Tuesday night and emergency dispatchers told her to wait for help. But just before dawn, she awoke to find the car was nearly submerged and she was out of gas.
""The water just came up so fast next to my car, it was crazy,"" she told the Press-Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa.
She wound up in an emergency shelter, bringing with her a handbag, a backpack and a pair of rain boots.
In Guerneville, streets became seas of muddy brown water. Jeff Bridges, a hotel co-owner who is president of the Russian River Chamber of Commerce, spent the day canoeing through town and gave a ride to a couple and their dog who were stranded in a low-lying apartment.
Five people whose homes were flooded were bunking down at his two-bedroom home.
""We saw quite a few fish swimming by my front porch,"" he said.
Bridges said this flood was the fourth he's experienced in 33 years and the locals took the disaster calmly.
""It's the price you pay to live in paradise,"" he said. ""Buffalo, New York puts up with blizzards. Miami and Houston put up with hurricanes...we have floods.""
However, Bridges said it will take weeks to clean up his R3 Hotel, as he has done in past floods. More than 8 feet of water inundated the 23-room business.
""Anything that's been flooded you've got to rip it out, sanitize everything...and rebuild,"" he said, but added nonchalantly: ""Everything's fixable.""","The Russian River in the wine country north of San Francisco crested at more than 46 feet Wednesday night, Sonoma County officials said.",2019-02-28T13:35:00Z,California town 'essentially an island' due to floodwaters,NBC News,1
"The Latest on the first use of the nation's tallest dam in two years (all times local):
11:20 a.m.
Water is flowing down the rebuilt spillway of the nation's tallest dam for the first time since it crumbled two years ago and threatened to flood California communities.
Live video by the California Department of Parks and Recreation shows a light stream of water flowing down the main spillway Tuesday. It comes as spring storms are expected to swell the lake behind Oroville Dam this week.
Molly White with the state Department of Water Resources says crews may increase how much water is released if needed.
In early 2017, the dam's half-century-old spillway broke apart as it carried heavy flows from storms. That drove nearly 200,000 people from their homes over fears of catastrophic flooding.
Officials say the rebuilt spillway was ""designed and constructed using 21st century engineering practices.""
9:55 a.m.
California officials say they will start letting water out of the nation's tallest dam into the newly-rebuilt spillway Tuesday for the first time in two years.
The spillway crumbled in February 2017 as water was being released, prompting 200,000 downstream residents to flee their homes over fears of catastrophic flooding.
Molly White, principal engineer with the California Department of Water Resources, says crews will start releasing 8,300 cubic feet per second at 11 a.m. Tuesday. She says they may increase the water release to 20,000 cubic feet per second.
White says the water releases may be increased during the week as spring storms continue to feed the enormous reservoir behind Oroville Dam in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
12:00 a.m.
Water will rush down the main spillway at the nation's tallest dam for the first time since it crumbled in heavy rain two years ago and threatened to flood California communities.
The state Department of Water Resources anticipates releasing water down the spillway at Oroville Dam as early as Tuesday due to stormy weather.
The spring storms follow a very wet winter that coated the mountains with thick snowpack. State experts will coincidentally measure the snowpack Tuesday to determine the outlook for California's water supplies.
In early 2017, the dam's half-century-old spillway broke apart as it carried heavy flows from storms. That drove nearly 200,000 people from their homes over fears of catastrophic flooding.

"A rare coin a teen received from his school cafeteria could fetch well over $1 million at auction.
The coin was produced accidentally in 1943, according to Heritage Auctions, where aspiring buyers are bidding on the coin. The penny was created after ""a small number of bronze planchets was caught in the trap doors of the mobile tote bins used to feed blanks into the Mint's coin presses at the end of 1942,"" according to auction house. 
Those bronze planchets then fed into the coin press, leading to the creation of several coins that were ""lost in the flood of millions of 'steel' cents struck in 1943."" That year, during World War II, the U.S. Mint was striking one-cent coins using zinc-coated steel instead of previously-used copper, which is used in bronze. During the war, copper was considered strategic, said Heritage Auctions.
Today, the Dallas-based auction house describes the 1943 bronze Lincoln cent as ""the most famous error coin in American numismatics.""
High school student Don Lutes, Jr., of Massachusetts, came across one by chance -- back in 1947. 
When he found one in cafeteria change in March that year, he was ""old enough to remember the 'steel' cents struck in 1943, which were still commonly seen in circulation at the time, so this copper-colored example aroused his curiosity,"" according to Heritage Auctions. ""As a coin collector, he set the coin aside for future study, but did not publicize his find until years later.""
The top bid for the coin as of Wednesday morning was $120,000. But, as Fortune reported, that could spike. In 2010, a 1943 penny created with a bronze planchet sold for $1.7 million.

"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor officials on Tuesday pressed lawmakers to strengthen enforcement of the provisions of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) intended to protect workers, the latest sign that the trade deal could face hurdles to passage in the Democrat-led House of Representatives. 
Renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and part of his broader push for better terms of trade for the United States. He has said that bad deals have cost millions of jobs. 
Representatives from some of the largest and most influential unions in the United States told lawmakers on Tuesday that the reworked pact does not go far enough to ensure improvement of wages and working conditions, especially for Mexican workers. 
“All the NAFTA renegotiation efforts in the world will not create U.S. jobs, raise U.S. wages or reduce the U.S. trade deficit if the new rules do not include clear, strong and effective labor rules that require Mexico to abandon its low wage policy,” Celeste Drake of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said at a House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing. 
In late 2018, the leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada signed the deal to replace NAFTA, but it has yet to be reviewed and ratified by Congress. Trade among the three countries totals more than $1 trillion. 
Democrats, who took control of the House of Representatives in January, have traditionally been skeptical of free trade agreements and sympathetic to labor groups. Their support is essential to USMCA’s passage. 
USMCA requires its three signatories to maintain labor laws in line with international standards, and to enforce them. But critics have called the agreement’s enforcement mechanism insufficient, saying it will still allow weak unions and resulting low wages in Mexico, while failing to stanch the flight of U.S. factories to lower-cost Mexico. 
NAFTA, launched in 1994, put labor provisions in an unenforceable addendum to the agreement, allowing Mexican wages to stagnate despite a flood of factory investment from U.S. companies. 
“The (USMCA) labor chapter is an improvement. The problem is the enforceability mechanism,” said Shane Larson, a director with the Communications Workers of America, advocating for reopening the agreement. 
Autoworkers, too, are concerned about the new agreement, despite provisions aimed at requiring more vehicle value content produced in North America and in high-wage areas in the United States and Canada. 
USMCA “takes some positive steps but doesn’t measure up to being able to make more good-paying jobs now and going forward,” said Josh Nassar, legislative director of the United Auto Workers union. 
The imposition of NAFTA led to decades of lost jobs for autoworkers, who watched U.S. factories close as manufacturers moved production to Mexico. 
House Democrats have greeted USMCA coolly, telling U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer earlier this month about their concerns about labor enforcement and provisions that could lock in higher drug prices. 
“This agreement is a continuation of the assault on the American middle class,” Brian Higgins, a Democratic representative from New York, said on Tuesday at the hearing. 
The Trump administration is lobbying to persuade Congress to ratify USMCA this year. Trump visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with Senate Republicans, and was due to discuss the trade pact with House Republicans later in the afternoon.

President Hassan Rouhani promised compensation for all financial losses and called for the armed forces to help in flooded areas. 
“I ask the army and the Revolutionary Guards to help with removing the water and with engineering work in which they have significant capabilities and tools,” Rouhani was quoted as saying on Tuesday at a meeting of a government crisis group. 
Rouhani’s hardline rivals have accused the government of doing too little, too late. 
In a meeting broadcast on state television, the president said: “When a city goes under water because of a flood and neighborhoods face this problem, removing the water is a difficult, heavy task.” 
The head of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi, said that officials who mishandled the disaster and caused the death of civilians could face prosecution, Fars news agency reported. 
The flood killed one person in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province in western Iran on Tuesday and one in Khuzestan Province in the south west, state media said. 
At least 18 deaths were reported on Monday, with hundreds injured. 
The flood has blocked a highway in eastern Tehran, state media said. Videos posted on social media showed cars driving in flooded roads in southeast districts of the capital. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the videos. 
Iran is celebrating the Nowrouz new year holidays, a time when many families travel around the country, but police asked people to avoid unnecessary journeys. 
State television said several villages near rivers and dams in different provinces had been evacuated. 
The country’s crude oil pipelines have avoided damage from flooding in recent days and the transfer of oil is taking place normally, Iranian Oil Pipeline and Telecommunication Co director Abbasali Jafarinasab was quoted as saying by the oil ministry’s SHANA news website.

"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Record floods that submerged parts of three Midwestern states bringing death and destruction were retreating in Kansas City on Monday but icy tributaries in Montana and the Dakotas threatened more floods for weeks to come, the National Weather Service said. 
High flood waters have already returned in the western Dakotas, northwest Nebraska and central and eastern Montana, along smaller rivers that feed into the Missouri, David Roth, a meteorologist with the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said on Monday. 
Warmer weather makes the once solid river ice break-up into giant chunks, like mini-icebergs, Roth said. 
“The ice floats down river until it bunches up in what we call an ice-jam, like a dam, causing flooding,” he said. 
“All that backed-up water is eventually going downstream,” Roth said. “It’ll come down the Missouri in a couple of weeks, and maybe hit Kansas City in mid-April.” 
Midwest floods were unleashed last week after a “bomb cyclone” storm dumped torrential rains on hundreds of square miles (km) of the snow-covered Plains. 
The record flows cascaded down the Missouri, the country’s longest river, killing at least four people, drowning livestock and closing dozens of roads in Nebraska and Iowa. Property losses were estimated at more than $3 billion in those two states. 
Those flood waters crested near Kansas City on Sunday, the weather service said. 
No further precipitation is forecast for the Midwest until midweek, when moderate rainfall is expected, NWS’s Andrew Orrison said Sunday. 
“I think at the worst what it will do is just prolong the gradual receding of the water levels across the various river basins throughout the Midwest.” 
The current flooding threatens Kansas City’s drinking water. More than 600,000 customers in the Kansas City metropolitan area were asked to conserve water as flood-levels in the Missouri River created “treatment challenges,” the city’s water utility said on Sunday. 
But far up the nation’s longest river, floods loom again. 
The Billings Gazette reported late Sunday that rapid snow melt drove ice jams on the Little Bighorn River, forced the shutdown of a stretches of major highways in eastern Montanta all the way to the Wyoming border. 
But the bigger threat is warmer temperatures that will hit the upper 60s in Billings by Tuesday and into midweek, driving more snowmelt that will eventually flow south, said meteorologist Roth. 
“All that water is still headed downstream,” he said.

"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An Australian wedding magazine has closed after LGBT+ activists used the power of the “pink pound” to persuade advertisers to abandon it over a decision not to cover same-sex marriages. The founders of White Magazine, Luke and Carla Burrell, said they had decided to close it after experiencing a “flood of judgement” that left it unviable. “A campaign was launched targeting the magazine, our team and our advertisers,” said the couple, who decided not to include same-sex couples for religious reasons, in a statement. “The result has been that a number of advertisers withdrew their sponsorship out of fear of being judged, or in protest. We have had to recognize the reality that White Magazine is no longer economically viable.” Australia legalized same-sex marriages in December last year. The magazine is the latest company to close as LGBT+ campaigners have increasingly focused on businesses refusing to comply with requests from gay and transgender customers. In the United States, Sweet Cakes by Melissa closed in 2016 following a row over the owners’ refusal to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding three years earlier. At the heart of the matter is the growing economic clout of gay and trans consumers - and their importance for advertisers. Research conducted by Kantar Consulting, part of the major advertising group WPP, estimated LGBT+ buying power in the United States alone at $1 trillion in 2016 almost equal to African-American or Hispanic consumers. “As a business principle you can’t close your doors to certain people,” said Sean Howell, co-founder of Hornet, an LGBT+ social network that commissioned the Kantar survey. “If you close them for gay people, are you going to close them to any woman who’s ever had an abortion? “I don’t think it is the place of business to make a moral judgement against people; business by its nature should be open,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday. Advertisers around the world have taken note. Smirnoff vodka and frozen food company McCain are among the brands to have launched specifically LGBT+ advertisements in recent years. “As a publication, (the White Magazine) has the right to cover what they want, but as a flipside as consumers we have the right to consume what we want,” said Sian Hainsworth, founder and head of production at social content agency Live &amp; Wired. “What this shows to me is that the majority want to consume media that reflects all of society.” Many countries explicitly outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexuality for companies offering goods and services. However, last month Britain’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a refusal by Northern Ireland-based Ashers Baking Company to bake a cake bearing the words “Support Gay Marriage” was not discriminatory.

"A CNN commentator lambasted Israel in a U.N. speech that drew applause from diplomats on Wednesday, while calling for a ""free Palestine from the river to the sea"" -- language critics describe as a dog whistle advocating the elimination of Israel. Marc Lamont Hill made the remarks during a special meeting of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People in observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. In the remarks, in which he accused the Israeli government of “normalizing settler colonialism,” Hill drew a comparison to the civil rights movement in America and suggested violence could be a tool for Palestinian activists. “If we are standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people, we must recognize the right of an occupied people to defend itself. We must prioritize peace, but we must not romanticize or fetishize it,” he said. “We must advocate and promote nonviolence at every opportunity, but we cannot endorse a narrow politics of respectability that shames Palestinians for resisting, for refusing to do nothing in the face of state violence and ethnic cleansing."" At one point, he poured himself some water and told participants that he just got off a flight from “Palestine” and that “I was boycotting the Israeli water so I was unable to quench my thirst.” He finished his speech by saying that ""justice requires a free Palestine from the river to the sea."" The remark was applauded by participants in the chamber. In response, Israel Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon told Fox News: “It is unfortunate to see the forces of hatred and rejection co-opt and seduce news commentators into believing their lies and false narratives."" Commentators accused Hill of employing a phrase used by groups like Hamas that call for the destruction of Israel. “Those calling for ‘from the river to the sea’ are calling for an end to the State of Israel,"" Sharon Nazarian, the Anti-Defamation League’s senior vice president for international affairs, wrote to the Jewish Journal. “It is a shame that once again, this annual event at the United Nations does not promote constructive pathways to ‘Palestinian solidarity’ and a future of peace, but instead divisive and destructive action against Israel.” Washington Examiner commentator Seth Mandel said that it was more than a dog whistle, and accused Hill of going “full Farrakhan,” referring to radical Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has a history of anti-Semitic comments. Hill responded on Twitter to claims he was alluding to a Hamas rallying cry by saying he did not endorse, support, or mention Hamas. “'River to the sea' is a phrase that precedes Hamas by more than 50 years. It also has a variety of meanings,” he tweeted. CNN did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News The U.S. and Israel regularly accuse the U.N. of harboring an anti-Israel bias and encouraging anti-Israeli speakers. Tuesday's meeting was hardly a fringe meeting, with the participants including Secretary General Antonio Guterres and General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés. Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and President of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News that Hill’s speech was an ""especially obscene U.N. moment that reveals the true nature of the anti-Israel and anti-Jewish animus of the modern United Nations."" “Hill's call at the United Nations for the destruction of the Jewish state was not some accident. He didn't misspeak. He was an invited guest. He was the only person invited to speak as 'the' representative of 'civil society.'

"Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, March 20, 2019. A powerful storm this week is expected to dump significant snow and rain on farms and floodplains that are still struggling to recover from last months historic storm. (Hilary Swift/The New York Times)
Written by Richard A. Oppel Jr.
A storm bearing down on the Great Plains this week may or may not qualify as another bomb cyclone. But it will certainly be big.
The unusually powerful storm is expected to dump significant snow and rain on farms and floodplains that are struggling to recover from a historic storm three weeks ago that pummeled the Midwest and left wide areas swallowed by rising rivers.
The coming storm will hit with force Wednesday: Rain first, and then thunderstorms that will turn into heavy snow and squalls. Some forecasters believe this system could drop even more snow on the region than the one in mid-March did, as it moves slowly through the region. Parts of South Dakota, northeastern Nebraska and southern Minnesota could be whipped with wind gusts of up to 50 mph and may get a foot of snow or maybe as much as 2 feet.
But there are reasons to hope that this round of foul weather will not be as devastating as the last. The air has been warmer temperatures reached the high 70s in Omaha, Nebraska, on Monday and the ground has thawed in many areas, so the soil, though still somewhat saturated, will be able to soak up more rain. And the storms overall intensity will probably not be as great.
In other words, this storm may in places appear to be a worse and more blinding blizzard, but forecasters hope that its effects will be less severe.
Of course, they caution that there is no way to predict flooding with certainty. And the forecasters point to a paradox this time around: The more snow, the better.
If most of the storms total precipitation falls as rain, the chances are greater that rapid runoff will swell rivers and streams dangerously setting back efforts to repair dozens of levees that were overwhelmed last month.
But if the storm delivers more snow than rain, the runoff could take days longer. The snow would melt gradually as temperatures rise above freezing during the day and then dip back down at night.
Snowfall will delay the amount of water coming in, and that could be a real benefit, said David Pearson, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Omaha. The snow just takes the edge off.
The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Overall, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees Monday to about 40 degrees Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Pearson, Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Parts of South Dakota, northeastern Nebraska and southern Minnesota could be whipped with wind gusts of up to 50 mph and may get a foot of snow — or maybe as much as 2 feet.",2019-04-09T02:07:29Z,Powerful storm threatens more misery in flood-hit Midwest,The New York Times,1

"It used to be that to see what kind of maneuvers potential presidential candidates were undertaking at this early stage of the process, all we had to go on was whether they turned up in Iowa to speak of their deep affection for ethanol. But with more sophisticated campaigning tools comes a better understanding of how the candidates themselves view the challenge before them. Joshua Green reports on the latest advertising from Democrats : Democrats built a midterm electoral wave by centering their message around health care. But since the Nov. 6 election, many Democratic ads have shifted focus from protecting health insurance to protecting special counsel Robert Mueller. In the past several weeks, prominent Democrats have run thousands of Facebook ads urging viewers to sign petitions in support of Mueller, who may be vulnerable to political interference by the Trump administration after the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They include Senators Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Cory Booker of New Jersey and billionaire activist Tom Steyer, along with a super PAC tied to former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. All those people are of course possible presidential candidates, and what theyre doing could be called pandering, or being sensitive to voters concerns. But you can bet theyre constantly watching how many clicks and likes each of their ads gets, so if theyre all focusing on Mueller right now, thats a good indicator its what Democratic voters want to hear. We cant extrapolate from a brief snapshot what their strategies will be over the course of the next year and a half, but it shows how technology allows them to focus in on what primary voters want, which discourages them from worrying too much about the general election. For both candidates and voters, electability as a primary concern may be essentially dead. And good riddance. As Ive argued before, to say you think a candidate is electable is to say that whatever you might think of her, you suspect other people will like her. While that may sound like a reasonable part of any primary voters judgment, the truth is that generally speaking were terrible at making that prediction. Candidates who look good on paper your John Kerry, your Mitt Romney are often marked as electable but turn out to be uninspiring, while candidates who excite their partys base, like Barack Obama or Donald Trump, tend to be viewed as less electable but wind up being more successful. So what is a 2020 Democratic primary voter who no longer cares about electability looking for? These days, Democrats despise Donald Trump with such a white-hot passion that they may be unable to see much else when choosing from among the 40 or 50 people who will run in 2020. That doesnt necessarily mean theyll gravitate toward the person whos the angriest or the loudest, but it does mean that the vision of each candidates potential matchup with Trump, and their reaction (both logical and emotional) to the critique of Trump the candidates offer, will be foremost in their minds. And because the data available to the candidates is more granular than ever, theyre likely to mirror the voters beliefs and emotions back at them. If a campaign runs one ad about health care and another about the Russia scandal and finds that the latter performed better, then thats what theyll probably spend more time talking about. The result could be a cycle in which voters gravitate toward anti-Trump messaging, candidates give them more of it, which encourages them to feed their anger at Trump, and around it goes. But is there anything wrong with that? He is the president, after all. The 2020 election will inevitably be mostly about him. Ironically, the Democrats could spend more time talking about Trump in the primaries when theyre running against each other than in the general election when theyre running against him. The 2018 election showed them the value of keeping the focus on their own issues (like health care) in a general election and avoiding getting distracted by whatever crazy thing he does on a given day or what issues (like the phantom threat of a few thousand desperate people seeking asylum) he wants everyone to talk about. But the general election of 2020 is a year and a half away. In the meantime, all those Democrats will be telling their base what it wants to hear.",Not that there's anything wrong with that.,2018-11-29T21:44:52Z,"From Democratic presidential candidates, a flood of early digital pandering",The Washington Post,0

"Bangkok (CNN)Thousands of people are fleeing Thai islands popular with tourists ahead of what could be the most devastating storm to hit Thailand in decades, officials told CNN on Thursday.
Tropical Storm Pabuk is expected to make landfall around 7 p.m. local time Friday (5 a.m. ET) near the Chumphon archipelago, on the eastern border of Thailand's Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces, but heavy rains are expected to arrive in the next few hours.
Tourist hotspots in the Gulf of Thailand, including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao islands, along with islands in the Andaman Sea such as Phuket and Koh Phi Phi -- made famous by the movie ""The Beach"" -- are expected to be affected by the storm.
""We are still compiling the number of evacuees. I can say several thousand people for over 16 provinces,"" Thai government spokesman Putthipong Punnakanta told CNN by phone. 
""It is high season, there are many foreign tourists at popular destinations. We have informed them in advance since two days ago. I would say most of them have left islands and come to the mainland.""
Phuwieng Prakhammintara, director general of Thailand's Meteorological Department, told CNN the storm could cause waves as high as seven meters (22 feet), but that waves were more likely to reach 3 to 5 meters in height.
Schools in coastal areas are to be closed and Thailand's armed forces are on standby for Pabuk's arrival.
Bangkok Airways announced the cancellation of all flights to and from Koh Samui on Friday ""for safety reasons."" Affected passengers will be able to rebook their flights without paying fees or charges, the airline said.
After crossing the Chumphon Archipelago the storm will, if the current track holds, make a second landfall over Surat Thani province in the early hours of Saturday morning. 
Pabuk will then move over the Malay Peninsula towards the Andaman Sea relatively quickly, but not before dumping large amounts of rain across the region.
The storm is expected to bring strong winds, high waves and surf along with surge, and heavy rain with flooding. While the winds, surf and surge will be dangerous especially, to an area not used to seeing these types of storms, the most significant danger is the rain and flood potential.
Areas in the southern most portion of Thailand could receive well over 250mm of rain. There is also the possibility of mudslides from the Phuket mountain range on the western side of the peninsula.
It is highly unusual for tropical storms and typhoons to make landfall in Thailand. The last time a tropical storm made landfall in Thailand was in 1962, when Tropical Storm Harriet impacted 12 provinces and claimed 900 lives. The only typhoon ever to make landfall in the Southeast Asian nation was Typhoon Gay in 1989.
The province likely to be worst affected is Nakhon Si Thammarat, where Harriet hit.
As the storm progresses out to the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal into next week it could become a problem for the coasts of Myanmar, Bangladesh or India.

"Meanss first story collection, A Quick Kiss of Redemption (1991), is fairly traditional, but one can already feel him chafing at the surly bonds of realist norms. A native of Kalamazoo, Mich., Means imbues the world of Quick Kiss with winters on the snowmobile and summers on the lake; its a place where a loaded 12-gauge is just common sense, and the awe inspired by a set of train tracks is that they could take you all the way to Chicago, or Detroit, depending on the way you go. The later collections the pathbreaking Assorted Fire Events, The Secret Goldfish (2004), The Spot (2010) and now Instructions for a Funeral take us farther afield in place and time, but tend to return either to the Michigan of Meanss youth or to the Hudson Valley, where he now lives, and where down at the edge of the half-frozen river, the soft shish of ice sliding over itself as the tide swept upstream, or down, became audible when the traffic noise on the road behind them subsided. This is from the new book, from a story called Farewell, My Brother, and if the title echoes Cheever the characters are pure Means: railroad bums and wharf rats and other castaways whose lives have been shattered by violence, loss and chance. Means extends the profound empathy of his attention to those who need it most, even if they deserve it least, which must be why he writes so often about adulterers, criminals and teenagers.
Like Flannery OConnor, Means senses that beneath every act of violence there pulses a vein of grace, a redemptive potential yearning to be tapped. This is a central tenet arguably the central tenet of Christianity, reified at the Crucifixion, which, if you believe it, is the eschatological zero point toward which all prior history was aimed and out of which all future history emerges. And because one must never lose sight of that point, there is a perpetual turning back toward it even as the distance from it grows, so that the structure of time is no longer a line but a spiral. I dont know whether Means believes this in the same way that OConnor (a devout Catholic) did, but his commitment to exploring its implications is the rock on which his writerly project is built.
In a story in the new book called The Ice Committee, a veteran-turned-drifter recalls how me and Billy-T found ourselves in the hot and heavy in Hue, so they call for air support. We hated them the way youd hate any savior, he says. They saved your life and took it at the same time, if you know what I mean. As it happens, the other drifters dont know what he means (or if they do, they wont admit it) but the reader does. This man survived the war, which anyway ended decades ago, but theres a part of him forever imprisoned in that afternoon in Hue, a frightened kid saved and broken as his prayer for rescue is answered in the form of a flood of fire from the sky.
Meanss recursive, iterative approach links individual stories to one another within a given book and connects each book to the rest. The narrator of The Ice Committee seems to be Kurt from Farewell, My Brother, and Billy-T, who appears in both stories, is a character in Meanss 2016 novel, Hystopia, as well as the title story of The Spot. Two of the best stories in Instructions for a Funeral are historical: Fistfight, Sacramento, August 1950 and The Tree Line, Kansas, 1934. The dryly descriptive titles have a precedent in Railroad Incident, August 1995 from Assorted Fire Events. The trilogy is linked not by character or place, but rather by the American male tendency to seek self-definition in conflict, because its easier to do harm and be harmed than to abide in the vulnerability that love requires, or to admit that violence is only the failed exorcism of ones own wild craving for oblivion.
Instructions for a Funeral is Meanss second collection to take an epigraph from William Carlos Williamss Spring and All. In The Secret Goldfish, we were warned that The pure products of America / go crazy an axiom proved by any given Means story. The new books epigraph explains that to refine, to clarify, to intensify that eternal moment in which we alone live there is but a single force the imagination. This would seem to speak less to subject than to process, which is fitting, since this is Meanss most self-reflective and self-reflexive book to date.
Half the stories in Instructions for a Funeral are apparently narrated by the same person (or at any rate, persona), a writer in the Hudson Valley who is increasingly agnostic about his works ability to effect the kinds of transformation on which he has long staked his aesthetic and spiritual claims. One of these stories (Fatherhood: Three) was first published as a personal essay. Another, Carver &amp; Cobain, has a headnote in which the writer-character describes his failure to produce a coherent fiction out of two biographical sketches: one of the legendary story writer Raymond Carver, the other of the grunge-rock icon Kurt Cobain. The connection was based on the fact that both men were from tough mill towns in Washington State, which remind the writer of the rural Michigan of his own childhood. But he never managed to connect these dots, and so presents the work as unfinished and abandoned, a failure. As a gesture, this is either incredibly lazy or incredibly brave. Or maybe, just maybe, the storys performance of failure is the true subject of its inquiry, in which case (i.e., considered as an exploration of artistic implosion) it succeeds, albeit with an asterisk by the win.","David Means’s latest collection, “Instructions for a Funeral,” is filled with adulterers and criminals, railroad bums and wharf rats and other castaways.",2019-03-10T15:00:03Z,Fiction: A Writer Who Finds Grace Beneath the Violence in His Stories,The New York Times,0

"As disastrous as the flood season has already been in the Plains and Midwest, it is likely to expand and become more severe, warned the National Oceanic and Administration, which released its spring outlook Thursday.
The historic flooding that has ravaged eastern Nebraska and other parts of the Midwest over the past week is just a preview of what may come next, officials told reporters Thursday.
We expect the flooding to get worse and become more widespread, said Mary Erikson, deputy director of NOAAs National Weather Service. The stage is set for record flooding now through May.
Erikson said the flooding could be worse than anything we have seen in recent years including the devastating floods in 1993 and 2011, considered among the worst in U.S. history.
Due to rivers levels that are already high, hefty snowpack in the northern plains and above normal soil moisture, conditions are primed for more flooding, said Edwark Clark, director of NOAAs National Weather Center.
This is potentially an unprecedented flood season, Clark said. It may become more dire in the coming weeks.
The outlook said 200 million Americans are at risk of experiencing flooding.
The areas of greatest risk for moderate to major flooding include the upper, middle, and lower Mississippi River basins including the mainstem Mississippi River, Red River of the North, the Great Lakes, eastern Missouri River, lower Ohio, lower Cumberland, and Tennessee River basins, the outlook said.
Major flooding causes extensive inundation of structures and roads, according to the National Weather Service, and frequently requires evacuation of low-lying areas.
The flood damage over the past week has cost $1.3 billion in Nebraska alone and has caused at least four deaths.
[As part of Midwest starts flood cleanup, downstream region braces for inundation]
The Weather Services Erikson described flooding as an underrated killer that leads to nearly 100 fatalities in an average year. 
Clark said about two-thirds of the Lower 48 is likely to experience some sort of flooding this spring. Over outside the zone of greatest risk in nations heartland, minor flooding, which can inundate roads and basements, is a risk east of the Mississippi River and in parts of California and Nevada, the outlook noted.
NOAAs Climate Prediction Center favors above normal precipitation during the April to June period over much of the middle of the nation, which will compound the flood risk. This follows a winter in which record precipitation fell in parts of the north central U.S., in some places 200 percent of normal.
[A nonstop stormy February produced precipitation records all over the nation]
But perhaps a bigger threat than the rain itself is the water locked in the snowpack. In the eastern Dakotas and most of Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground.
Over the next week, computer model simulations show that snowpack eroding, which will release large quantities of water into river systems intensifying flooding and ice jams.

As of Thursday, over 100 river and stream gauges in the Central U.S. indicated moderate to major flooding, and another 140 minor flooding.
The extensive flooding weve seen in the past two weeks will continue through May ... and may be exacerbated in the coming weeks as the water flows downstream, said Clark.

Already brutal weather has caused injuries aboard an American Airlines flight in Texas and the cancellation of a college football bowl game.
Now more dangerous conditions will wreak havoc for travelers through the rest of this week. Some cities will get buried under a foot of snow, while others will get pummeled with a severe storm or flooding.

"HIDALGO, Texas (AP) As President Donald Trump travels to the border in Texas to make the case for his $5.7 billion wall, landowner Eloisa Cavazos says she knows firsthand how the project will play out if the White House gets its way.
The federal government has started surveying land along the border in Texas and announced plans to start construction next month. Rather than surrender their land, some property owners are digging in, vowing to reject buyout offers and preparing to fight the administration in court.
You could give me a trillion dollars and I wouldnt take it, said Cavazos, whose land sits along the Rio Grande, the river separating the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. Its not about money.
Trump is scheduled to visit the border Thursday in McAllen, a city of 143,000 on the river.
Congress in March funded 33 miles (53 kilometers) of walls and fencing in Texas. The government has laid out plans that would cut across private land in the Rio Grande Valley. Those in the way include landowners who have lived in the valley for generations, environmental groups and a 19th century chapel.
Many have hired lawyers who are preparing to fight the government if, as expected, it moves to seize their land through eminent domain.
The opposition will intensify if Democrats accede to the Trump administrations demand to build more than 215 new miles of wall, including 104 miles in the Rio Grande Valley and 55 miles near Laredo. Even a compromise solution to build steel slats, as Trump has suggested, or more fencing of the kind that Democrats have previously supported would likely trigger more court cases and pushback in Texas.
Legal experts say Trump likely cannot waive eminent domain which requires the government to demonstrate a public use for the land and provide landowners with compensation by declaring a national emergency.
While this is Trumps first visit to the border in Texas as president, his administrations immigration crackdown has been felt here for months.
Hundreds of the more than 2,400 children separated from their parents last summer were detained in cages at a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. Three tender-age facilities for the youngest children were opened in this region.
The president also ordered soldiers to the border in response to a wave of migrant caravans before the November election. Those troops had a heavy presence in the Rio Grande Valley, though they have since quietly left. A spokeswoman for the border security mission said they closed their base camp along the border on Dec. 22.
But Trumps border wall will last beyond his administration. Building in the region is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security because its the busiest area for illegal border crossings. More than 23,000 parents and children were caught illegally crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley in November more than triple the number from a year earlier.
Homeland Security officials argue that a wall would stop many crossings and deter Central American families from trying to migrate north. Many of those families are seeking asylum because of violence in their home countries and often turn themselves in to border agents when they arrive here.
The number of families has surged. DHS said Wednesday that it detained 27,518 adults and children traveling together on the southern border in December, a new monthly high.
With part of the $1.6 billion Congress approved in March, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced it would build 25 miles (40 kilometers) of wall along the flood-control levee in Hidalgo County, which runs well north of the Rio Grande.
Congress did not allow construction of any of Trumps wall prototypes. But the administrations plans call for a concrete wall to the height of the existing levee, with 18-foot (5.5 meters) steel posts on top. CBP wants to clear 150 feet (45 meters) in front of any new construction for an enforcement zone of access roads, cameras, and lighting.
The government sued the local Roman Catholic diocese late last year to gain access for its surveyors at the site of La Lomita chapel, which opened in 1865 and was an important site for missionaries who traveled the Rio Grande Valley by horseback.
It remains an epicenter of the Rio Grande Valleys Catholic community, hosting weddings and funerals, as well as an annual Palm Sunday procession that draws 2,000 people.
The chapel is a short distance from the Rio Grande. It falls directly into the area where CBP wants to build its enforcement zone.
The diocese said it opposes a border wall because the barrier violates Catholic teachings and the churchs responsibility to protect migrants, as well as the churchs First Amendment right of religious freedom. A legal group from Georgetown University has joined the diocese in its lawsuit.
Father Roy Snipes leads prayers each Friday for his chapel to be spared. Wearing a cowboy hat with his white robe and metal cross, hes known locally as the cowboy priest and sometimes takes a boat on the Rio Grande to go from his home to the chapel.
It would poison the water, Snipes said. It would still be a sacred place, but it would be a sacred place that was desecrated.
The Cavazos familys roughly 64 acres (0.25 square kilometers) were first purchased by their grandmother 60 years ago.
They rent some of the property to tenants who have built small houses or brought in trailers, charging some as little as $1,000 a year. They live off the earnings from the land and worry that a fence would deter renters and turn their property into a no mans land.
On the rest of the property are plywood barns, enclosures for cattle and goats, and a wooden deck that extends into the river, which flows serenely east toward the Gulf of Mexico. Eloisas brother, Fred, can sit on the deck in his wheelchair and fish with a rod fashioned from a long carrizo reed plucked from the riverbank.
Surveyors examined their property in December under federal court order. The family hasnt yet received an offer for their land, but their lawyers at the Texas Civil Rights Project expect a letter with an offer will arrive in the coming weeks.
Everybody tells us to sell and go to a better place, Eloisa Cavazos said. This is heaven to us.","HIDALGO, Texas (AP) — As President Donald Trump travels to the border in Texas to make the case for his $5.7 billion wall, landowner Eloisa Cavazos says she knows firsthand how the project will play out if the White House gets its way.

"CHICAGO/COLUMBUS, Neb. (Reuters) - At least 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) of U.S. farmland were flooded after the “bomb cyclone” storm left wide swaths of nine major grain producing states under water this month, satellite data analyzed by Gro Intelligence for Reuters showed. 
Farms from the Dakotas to Missouri and beyond have been under water for a week or more, possibly impeding planting and damaging soil. The floods, which came just weeks before planting season starts in the Midwest, will likely reduce corn, wheat and soy production this year. 
“There’s thousands of acres that won’t be able to be planted,” Ryan Sonderup, 36, of Fullerton, Nebraska, who has been farming for 18 years, said in a recent interview. 
“If we had straight sunshine now until May and June, maybe it can be done, but I don’t see how that soil gets back with expected rainfall.” 
Spring floods could yet impact an even bigger area of cropland. The U.S. government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of what could be an “unprecedented flood season” as it forecasts heavy spring rains. Rivers may swell further as a deep snow pack in northern growing areas melts. 
The bomb cyclone of mid-March was the latest blow to farmers suffering from years of falling income and lower exports because of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Fields are strewn with everything from silt and sand to tires and some may not even be farmed this year. The water has also destroyed billions of dollars of old crops that were in storage, as well as damaging roads and railways. 
Justin Mensik, a fifth-generation farmer of corn and soybeans in Morse Bluff, Nebraska, said rebuilding roads was the first priority. Then farmers would need to bring in fertilizer trucks and then test soil before seeding, Mensik said. 
The flood “left a lot of silt and sand and mud in our fields, now we’re not too sure if we’re going to be able to get a good crop this year with all the new mud and junk that’s just laying here,” Mensik told Reuters. 
CORN CONCERN 
For farmers, “the biggest concern right now is corn planting,” said Aaron Saeugling, an agriculture expert at Iowa State University who does outreach with farmers. “There is just not going to be enough time to move a lot of that debris.” 
To be fully covered by crop insurance, Iowa farmers must plant corn by May 31 and soybeans by June 15, as yields decline dramatically when planted any later. Deadlines vary state by state. The insurance helps ensure a minimum price farmers will receive when they book sales for their crops. 
Nearly 1.1 million acres of cropland and more than 84,000 acres of pastureland in the U.S. Midwest had flood water on it for at least seven days between March 8 and March 21, according to a preliminary analysis of government and satellite data by New-York based Gro Intelligence at the request of Reuters. The extent of the flooding had previously not been made public. 
The flooded acreage represents less than 1 percent of U.S. land used to grow corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, cotton, sorghum and barley. In 2018, some 240 million total acres of these crops were planted in the United States, USDA data shows. 
Iowa, the top U.S. corn and No. 2 soy producing state, had the most water, covering 474,271 acres, followed by Missouri with 203,188 acres, according to Gro Intelligence. That was in line with estimates given to Reuters this week by government officials in Iowa and Missouri. 
Gro Intelligence used satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Near Real-Time Global Flood Mapping product, to calculate the approximate extent and intensity of flooding. 
Gro Intelligence then identified how much of this area was either cropland or pastureland, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). 
Gro Intelligence analysts cautioned the satellite imagery did not show the full extent of flooding in Nebraska, where officials declined to provide acreage estimates to Reuters, or in North Dakota. Nebraska’s governor has said the floods caused agricultural damage of $1 billion in his state. 
Cloud cover or snow on the ground makes it difficult to identify the flood waters in NASA satellite data, said Sara Menker, chief executive of the agricultural artificial intelligence company. 
LOST CATTLE 
In Missouri, floodwaters covered roughly 200,000 acres in five northwest counties adjoining the Missouri River as of Wednesday morning, said Charlie Rahm, spokesman for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Columbia. 
In Wisconsin more than 1,000 dairy and beef animals were lost during winter storms and 480 agricultural structures collapsed or damaged, according to an email from Sandy Chalmers, executive director of the Wisconsin state office of the USDA’s Farm Service Agency. 
In the Dakotas and Minnesota, melting snows in coming months will put spring wheat planting at risk. Gro Intelligence found nearly 160 million acres have already been flooded in Minnesota. 
“That’s yet to come and we will deal with that at least until the middle of April,” said Dave Nicolai, an agriculture expert at the University of Minnesota.

"You werent actually involved in any real fighting over there, were you? a childhood friend asked me on my return from Iraq. I felt as offended as if hed walked up and slapped me. I felt invalidated by the very question. Of course I was! I shot back. What do you think Ive been doing for the past 10 years?! I explained that we were tasked with the pursuit and capture of specific individuals, making our mission unrelentingly violent. We used plastic explosives to enter Iraqi homes in the dark hours, flowing through them like a flash flood, heralding our entry into each room with flash-bang grenades that felt like a punch in the head if you followed them too closely. We fought in the homes of our enemies, among their families. I told him what it was like to be in a firefight inside a house. How the blast of automatic weapons fire in a small room is so loud as to strip away conscious thought, leaving muscle memory born of rote repetition to determine who lives or dies. It was seven months of blood and fire and broken glass. He seemed discomfited by the exchange, and after a silence changed the subject. If a friend Id grown up with, who knew me well, could not, or did not want to, understand what I was saying, how could I hope to explain it to anyone else?
On the way home from Iraq, we were herded into a tent in Kuwait and given forms that asked us to indicate the experiences wed had by coloring in bubbles next to questions. Had I seen Americans wounded? Yes. Had I seen Americans killed? Yes. Had I seen Iraqis wounded? Yes. Had I seen Iraqis killed? Yes. Had I been shot at? Yes. Had I shot at anyone? Yes. We turned in the forms, then wandered the camp, constrained by huge sand berms, with little to do other than eat and ogle mannequins in skimpy lingerie being sold by Kuwaiti merchants. I was never asked about that form again. I still dont know its purpose. It was the first of many occasions when someone asked me for my story but didnt seem to know what to do with the answers.
Having spent the majority of the deployment cleaning ourselves under a single cold-water pipe, we took advantage of a nearby shower trailer reserved solely for Marines permanently assigned in Kuwait. Two such Marines entered as we basked in the steam from the hot showers. One of them demanded we leave. No one said a word, but the look in our eyes must have said something dire because the second Marine grabbed the first by the arm and simply said, Back away, man, theyve been up north, and left us to ourselves. Even before we had left the region, even among our fellow Marines, we had already become disconnected. I wondered how we would explain to people back home the things we had done in their name. But I hold to the notion that there is value in the effort value for me and, I hope, for the people who I talk to.
On our return to Camp Lejeune, N.C., we were freed to spend a night with our families. Unable to sleep, I woke my wife at 2 a.m. and made her watch Napoleon Dynamite, a movie that so divided my platoon I thought we would come to blows over its absurdities. I wanted her to see and understand something about the previous seven months of my life. I didnt know how to tell her about a 2-year-old child toddling through window glass shattered by an explosive charge and leaving tiny, bloody footprints on the polished concrete floor of his home. Later that morning, more than a hundred Marines assembled in a final unit formation behind a large brick building immediately across the New River from a demolitions range. Before we were dismissed for the last time as a unified group, some Marines across the river detonated a substantial charge. We all visibly flinched, some of us dropping to the ground, all of us conditioned to dodge the shrapnel and fire that invariably accompanied loud blasts in Iraq. We looked around at one another and slowly stood back up, laughing at ourselves but sharing a level of understanding that has since been elusive.
Ironically, that common understanding is both the thing we most need from each other as veterans and the thing that keeps some of us from effectively reconnecting with civilians, a critical factor as we become civilians ourselves. Sajers notion of remaining separated from the human condition, though he claimed not to feel regret, is nothing less than self-imposed exile. Just as I felt when I stood before that Iraqi policeman, it is my responsibility to say something, to find some sort of connection. I just ask that you not get frustrated or awkward and turn away if the translation comes haltingly, or if the truth proves to be more than you wanted.",I’m ready for the questions about the things I did when I went to war.

"(CNN) As Congress faces a December 21 deadline to avert a partial government shutdown, it must also clear a stack of other must-pass bills that affect millions of people and major sections of the economy. The lame-duck session is winnowing down with the holidays quickly approaching and the next session of Congress kicking off January 3, leaving little time to break through legislative standoffs that have bogged down progress on key issues for months. Also at play are end-of-session dynamics such as retiring lawmakers who have little appetite for congressional fights or Democrats who see a better path to success for major issues once their party takes over the House next year. Key on the to-do list is reauthorizing the monumental farm bill -- a huge piece of legislation that sets the eating and farming policy of the United States. It covers crop insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- commonly referred to as food stamps -- as well as proposed changes to federal forest management policies. The farm bill technically expired September 30, though major elements are funded through the end of the year. Negotiators recently came to an agreement on a final version after the House and Senate passed drastically different bills earlier this year. One of the major sticking points was the House bill's controversial addition of stricter work requirements for SNAP. The new agreement, however, largely resembles the Senate version and excludes the stricter work requirements. Violence Against Women Act Also high on the list is the Violence Against Women Act, which was set to expire on September 30. The bill has been extended through December 21, along with the must-pass spending bill to avoid the partial government shutdown. The current law, enacted in 1994 and reauthorized ever since, addresses sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, primarily by providing grants and support to organizations and law enforcement programs that work with domestic violence victims and prevention. Democrats and Republicans each introduced their own reauthorization bills this fall, but so far a final deal hasn't been reached. A Republican leadership aide said a lapse in funding for VAWA is not anticipated, but it's unclear whether a full five-year re-authorization with new legislation will happen in this Congress or the next. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who's the heavy favorite to be the next speaker of the House of Representatives, urged passage last week of a long-term re-authorization before the end of the year but said Democrats would take it up early next year if not. ""We'd like to do it this Congress, but if not we'll have to take it up at the beginning of next year,"" she said. ""But we'd rather do it (in) the Congress in which it was debated."" The same Republican leadership aide said the National Flood Insurance Program is also expected to see continued funding, even if it's unclear yet whether it will get a full re-authorization. The flood insurance program expired in 2017 but has been continued with multiple stopgaps ever since, and was most recently extended until December 21. The program covers 5 million families in 22,000 communities. Lawmakers have been at odds over how to add investments and make reforms to the program to help mitigate flood costs. Regional divides also exist between those who want to see a smaller federal role in flood insurance and those who live in flood zones and coastal areas. Along the lines of disaster relief, lawmakers are also trying to get emergency relief funding after devastating wildfires in California this year that cost dozens of lives and billions in damage. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Politico on Thursday she doesn't expect to get the $9 billion she requested for her state. Feinstein spokesman Tom Mentzer told CNN that the senator was referring to the fact that the $9 billion may not all come in the first round, but rather in several tranches as it has in the past. ""This isn't a problem now as there's sufficient disaster funds to pay for ongoing work,"" Mentzer said. Sexual harassment legislation Also on the docket for Congress -- though not necessarily must-pass items by the end of the year -- are key bills that remain in limbo as the clock ticks down. Sexual harassment reform in Congress is a high-profile item that was cleared in both chambers but through drastically different bills, and talks to merge the two bills together have stalled. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership and chairman of the Rules Committee, said ""we need to get this settled."" ""There is a House bill and there is Senate bill,"" added the senator from Missouri. ""So, we're down to where we could settle this with one vote on each side of the building and put it on the President's desk and it would be a huge mistake, I think, to miss this opportunity."" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who's set to become the next House majority leader, told reporters last week he was ""hopeful"" Congress would pass a final bill before the end of the year. ""If we don't, it's going to be very early on in our agenda next year,"" he said. If these issues do come for a vote this month, it's unclear if they'll get added to the must-pass spending bill or if they'll get their own separate votes. When GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate appropriations committee, was asked about adding the farm bill, the Violence Against Women Act re-authorization and sexual harassment legislation to the government spending package, he said ultimately it was up to the leadership to decide but he preferred not piling on complicated and politically tricky bills to the spending bills. ""We want to keep as many non-appropriations-type items off the bill, because it helped us move to where we are today,"" he said last week. Overhauling the US prison and sentencing laws Meanwhile in the Senate, there's a heated debate going on over criminal justice reform among Republicans. The legislation at hand, known as the First Step Act, would allow some current and future prisoners to get out earlier, and rehabilitate into society through halfway houses, home confinement or other supervision, by reducing drug-related mandatory sentences and making more offenders eligible for early release. The bill has backing from President Donald Trump and some major Republican donors but faces fierce opposition among some Republicans who say now is not the time to tackle criminal justice reform. GOP leaders in the Senate have repeatedly said they are assessing whether to take the bill to the floor but acknowledge their Republican caucus is deeply divided on the reforms and there is very little time left in the session to debate changes to the bill. ""The question is can you shoe horn something that's extremely controversial into the remaining time,"" Senate Majority Leaders Mitch McConnell said at an event last week. ""It's extremely divisive inside the Senate Republicans conference."" Also in the Senate is a long-running debate over a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller, who's leading the Russia investigation. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of his term in January, has teamed up with Democrats to push for a vote on the bill, but those efforts have gone unsuccessful, as Senate GOP leaders have repeatedly said there's no need for such legislation.

"(CNN)Severe weather is expected to stretch from coast to coast Tuesday, with more than 100 million people under some sort of winter watch, warning or advisory; nearly 25 million people under threat of flooding; and more snow on the way in Seattle.
Up to 4 inches of snow, followed by a coating of ice, was expected throughout the Northeast -- including in Philadelphia, New York and Boston -- into the morning on Tuesday, before turning into rain.
More than 600 flights into and out of John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports in New York had been canceled as of Tuesday morning, according to FlightAware. More than 1,480 flights were canceled across the country.
A winter storm watch is in effect throughout Massachusetts through Tuesday night. Tuesday's evening commute could be a tough one for Bostoners, as the few morning inches of snow turn into heavy sleet and eventually rain.
Cities including Des Moines, Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo could also see dangerous travel conditions as a band of sleet and ice is expected to cover roadways Tuesday.
A band of heavy snow also will set in Northern Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan, where residents could shovel away up to 12 inches of snow Tuesday morning.
Widespread rain will continue to soak the Ohio Valley from Arkansas to Ohio on Tuesday, bringing as much as 4 inches of rain.
Nearly 25 million are under a flood or flash flood watch. Cities including Nashville, Little Rock, Louisville, Lexington and Cincinnati could see flooding. 
Seattle, despite breaking its snowfall record for February not even halfway into the month, hasn't seen the end of its white days. A few inches of snow are possible around the area Tuesday, with heavy snowfall expected just west of town. 
Further south, the Sierra Nevada mountain tops in California can expect to continue to be pounded with snow over the next few days. Extreme winds are also forecast in the Sierra, with gusts of more than 100 mph.

"Congress has passed a continuing resolution to keep the government running through Dec. 21, when funding for the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies will expire. The resolution was approved by voice vote in both the House and Senate Thursday, and it'll now go to President Trump for signature. A partial government shutdown was set to occur if Congress could not agree on outstanding funding bills by Dec. 7, but President Trump and members of Congress agreed to extend the deadline after the death of former President George H.W. Bush. Mr. Bush lay in state at the Capitol on Monday and Tuesday, and his memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington took place Wednesday. Congressional Democrats and Mr. Trump are currently stalemated over funding for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Mr. Trump has said that he is willing to let the government partially shut down if he does not receive $5 billion for the wall. Meanwhile, House Democrats, who take the majority in January, refuse to consider full funding. ""Could there be a shutdown? There certainly could,"" the president told reporters in November, implying a veto threat over funding for his signature campaign issue. ""And it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly press conference she would not support portions of wall funding even if it were paired with a decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Mr. Trump has ended. ""They are two different subjects,"" Pelosi said. She advocated for passing the other remaining six appropriations bills and then passing a ""full year"" continuing resolution to fund the Homeland Security bill. This means that funding for the Homeland Security Department would continue at the same level as this year, rather than at new funding levels for controversial items like the border wall and detention beds. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with President Trump on Tuesday to talk about government funding. In addition to the Department of Homeland Security, Congress must pass new disaster funding, and renew the Violence Against Women Act, the farm bill and flood insurance.

"On top of the world one moment to being left brutally red-faced the next, that’s how things went for 20-year-old Noah Gragson on Sunday. The young star driver managed to secure a huge victory in the 51st annual Snowball Derby at Five Flags Speedway in Pensacola, Fla. His win came after a brilliant overtake following a restart with only seven laps remaining in the race and he held on through the checkered flag. After securing the biggest win of his young career and with a move up to the NASCAR Xfinity Series next season, Gragson was riding an emotional high. He was spectacularly brought back down to earth however when celebrating his monster win in the pitlane. Gragson channeled the words of ice hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky who stated: ""You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take."" Unfortunately, Gragson missed … hilariously.

"Washington plunged into political war on Wednesday in the wake of a split decision by voters in the midterm elections, with President Trump ousting his attorney general and threatening to retaliate against Democrats if they launch investigations into his personal conduct and possible corruption in the administration. The rapid shift to battle stations signaled the start of what is likely to be two years of unremitting political combat as Trump positions himself for reelection. For the first time, Trump will be forced to navigate divided government as Democrats who won the House pledge to be a check on his power and face pressure from their liberal base to block him at every turn. The acrimony was punctuated by Trumps bombast, as the president refused to show contrition or take responsibility for his partys washout in many suburban areas where voters who previously backed Republicans rejected the presidents hard-line politics. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), who is poised to lead the new Democratic majority as speaker, said her caucus would use its subpoena authority to pursue sweeping oversight of the Trump administration. We will have a responsibility to honor our oversight responsibilities, and thats the path that we will go down, she told reporters. But, she added, Democrats would do so in the interest of trying to unify our country. [ Midterm elections: Democrats capture House as GOP holds Senate ] Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), whose party lost seats in the upper chamber, nonetheless cheered the House triumph and said, Theres now a check on Donald Trump, and that is great news for America. In the wake of Tuesdays midterms, some allies said, Trump was both emboldened because he believed he had helped expand the Republican majority in the Senate and apprehensive, because he would no longer be able to bend all of Congress to his will. But unlike his predecessors who acknowledged a shellacking (Barack Obama in 2010) or a thumpin (George W. Bush in 2006) after midterm losses, Trump spun his own reality by claiming very close to complete victory. Trump said in a wide-ranging and often sharp-tongued news conference that any hope for bipartisan deals would evaporate if House Democrats use their new power to investigate him or his administration. Such efforts, he said bluntly, would precipitate a warlike posture. House Democrats have said they plan to begin a series of investigations of the president, including issuing a subpoena for his tax returns, which he has for years refused to release. Trump said he would respond by using the Republican-controlled Senate as a cudgel, instructing his allies there to investigate alleged misconduct by Democrats. They can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate, Trump said. They can look at us, then we can look at them and itll go back and forth. And itll probably be very good for me politically... because I think Im better at that game than they are, actually. [ Trump vows beautiful deals with Democrats but threatens warlike retaliation to probes ] Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday dodged a reporters question about what Senate Republicans would do if House Democrats try to investigate Trump. The Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is good strategy, McConnell told reporters. Im not so sure it will work for them, he added, noting that Republican investigations of President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s backfired politically. McConnell is trying to position the Senate as a stable front for conservative governance and to stay out of the political firefight between Trump and House Democrats, according to his advisers. As the Senate leader told reporters, his top priority will continue to be confirming conservative nominees to federal courts, which Republicans have done at a record pace the last two years. Trump has told advisers that he intends to exploit divisions among House Democrats, according to a senior White House official. He believes he can pit Pelosi and others who are interested in making deals with him on policies like infrastructure spending against those who rose to office intent on blocking his agenda and, perhaps, beginning impeachment proceedings. The presidents allies argued that Democrats were overestimating their mandate from Tuesdays elections and will emerge as a useful political foil for Trump as he seeks reelection. I feel sorry for the Democrats because hes going to crush them, former Trump deputy campaign manager David N. Bossie said. These people hate him more than they want to do their jobs, and thatll allow him to be reelected in 2020. Trump also has said privately that he does not believe his administration should necessarily cooperate with Democratic investigations, and that he would be willing to fight subpoenas to the Supreme Court if necessary, according to the senior White House official and an outside adviser to the president, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions. Trump has been consulting White House lawyer Emmet Flood, who is overseeing the handling of the Russia investigation, and Flood has expressed interest in fighting back against incoming subpoenas, according to the outside adviser. [ Sessionss ouster throws future of special counsel probe into question ] But Trumps confidence in his own ability to navigate the thicket of obstacles facing him will soon be tested, according to Republicans from past administrations who recall being humbled by congressional Democrats winning power. The deluge of legal scrutiny and congressional subpoenas risks overwhelming the presidents agenda. One of the things the White House needs to understand is that we doubled the size of the general counsels office and that wasnt big enough, former top George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove said about the Democrats sweep in the 2006 midterm elections. We found out pretty quick that we didnt have enough lawyers. The White House Counsels Office is undergoing a transition. Pat A. Cipollone only recently took over from Donald McGahn as counsel and has a number of vacancies to fill. The adviser described the office as in desperate need of recruiting more attorneys. Many experienced lawyers at top Washington firms have long been reluctant to join the White House, both because they would have to take a pay cut and because of the chronic turmoil inside. During his remarkably combative news conference in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, Trump repeatedly lost his cool as he answered questions from journalists for 86 minutes. He called CNNs Jim Acosta a rude, terrible person, snapped at Peter Alexander of NBC News and directed April Ryan of American Urban Radio to sit down. And when Yamiche Alcindor of PBS NewsHour asked the president whether by identifying as a nationalist he also was embracing the label white nationalist, he told her repeatedly, Thats such a racist question. To say what you just said is so insulting to me, Trump responded to Alcindor, who is black. Trump also was cutting in his criticism of some House Republicans who lost reelection, singling them out by name and attributing their losses to their decisions to distance themselves from him. Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost, Trump said, referring to the defeated Utah congresswoman who was the lone black Republican woman in the House. In a mocking tone, he continued, Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia. Trump also told reporters that he believes his chances of striking deals such as to fund building projects, lower the prices of prescription drugs and refashion trade policies would be greater with a divided Congress. He said he looked forward to working with Pelosi on a beautiful bipartisan-type situation. [ Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigns at Trumps request ] Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), who was reelected Tuesday in a state that Trump carried in 2016, said, Its in his interests, even with the preoccupation with investigations or the back and forth, to show he can move the country forward. People are pretty exhausted with the back and forth. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a confidant of Trump and head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, The president has always been about making a deal. I think youre going to see a lot more engagement with Congress. Still, Meadows said, he has not heard any consternation or concern expressed by my colleagues that the president will govern in a way that is not conservative. After demonizing Democrats in apocalyptic terms and attacking Pelosi on the campaign trail, Trump said Wednesday, The elections over. Now everybody is in love. But Trump drowned out his own call for unity within hours by announcing via Twitter the sudden ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said in his resignation letter that the president had directed him to resign. The two parties plunged into a fierce disagreement over whether the president was obstructing justice by replacing Sessions with acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, who immediately assumed control over special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The inquiry had previously been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. Democrats indicated that the firing of Sessions would be one of their top investigation targets and warned of a constitutional crisis. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is set to take over as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the Mueller probe was in new and immediate peril. Interference with the special counsels investigation would cause a constitutional crisis and undermine the rule of law, Schiff said. If the president seeks to interfere in the impartial administration of justice, the Congress must stop him. No one is above the law.","Washington Post Washington in battle mode as Trump vows retaliation against Democratic probes Washington Post Washington plunged into political war on Wednesday in the wake of a split decision by voters in the midterm elections, with President Trump ousting h…",2018-11-08T00:32:41Z,Washington in battle mode as Trump vows retaliation against Democratic probes - Washington Post,The Washington Post,0

"A sprawling storm closed schools, snarled travel and threatened homeless populations across a portion of the U.S. Wednesday. Snow and cold stretched from the Midwest to the East Coast, and heavy rain fell in the South. 
Nationwide, more than 2,000 flights were canceled and more than 3,400 were delayed, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. The mid-Atlantic region was especially hard hit as airlines pulled flights ahead of the storm. Washington's Reagan National Airport led the pack Wednesday morning, with 37 percent of departures and 33 percent of arrivals canceled. 
Amtrak earlier announced modifications to its Keystone service between New York and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 
Snow fell along the East Coast, and schools in several parts of the U.S. closed amid predictions for messy afternoon commutes. Philadelphia closed city offices as of 1 p.m. and put a ""code blue"" into effect, putting extra teams out to encourage homeless people to get into shelters. Parts of Pennsylvania could get 6 inches of snow, CBS Philly reported. 
New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency with up to 4 inches of snow expected before turning to rain Wednesday night. ""Our main concern in this storm is the impact on this evening's commute,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.
Farther west, snow forced Minneapolis and St. Paul schools and scores of other districts in Minnesota and Wisconsin to cancel classes. Schools, businesses and government offices in Kansas closed or announced plans to start late. Several school districts closed in Missouri, where officials said many roads across the northern half of the state were partially or completely snow covered. 
Heavy rains caused problems in parts of the Deep South. Flood watches and warnings covered the northern parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, and nearly all of Tennessee is at risk for floods.

Harare, Zimbabwe -- The presidents of Mozambique and Zimbabwe have returned home to deal with the effects of a powerful cyclone that has killed more than 150 people across southern Africa. Hundreds more were missing Sunday while tens of thousands were cut off from roads and telephones in mainly poor, rural areas.
Cyclone Idai has affected more than 1.5 million people in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, according to the U.N. and government officials.
Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi and Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa had both left for foreign trips just as the cyclone hit their respective countries. This drew criticism from some who thought they should have stayed at home to deal with a disaster whose overwhelming magnitude has not been experienced in years.
The International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies on Saturday said at least 126 people had died in Mozambique and Malawi. In Zimbabwe, 31 people have died from the floods, said the country's information ministry.

"Heavy snow and strong winds hammered parts of the central U.S. on Thursday and began moving into the Great Lakes region, knocking out power to tens of thousands of people and creating hazardous travel conditions a day after pummeling Colorado. 
Nearly 77,000 homes and business were without power across Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa and Michigan, according to PowerOutage.us. The main culprit was snow and ice accumulating on power lines, along with strong winds, said Matt Lindstrom, spokesman for Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy. 
The spring blizzard left behind hundreds of canceled flights at Denver International Airport, along with wintertime temperatures and snarled traffic before blanketing parts of the Upper Midwest with up to 2 feet of snow. 
Hundreds of schools canceled classes in Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota, where the governor closed state offices in much of the state for a second day Thursday because of dangerous road conditions. 
CBS Minnesota reported there were over 800 crashes and spinouts on state roads as of Thursday. Conditions were the worst in southwestern Minnesota.
 ""It's a mess out here. And that is an understatement,"" Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Gordon Shank said. 
Winter storm warnings were posted Thursday for northern Wisconsin and Michigan as heavy snow, strong winds, sleet and freezing rain moved into the region. The National Weather Service reported that daily snowfall records had already fallen in La Crosse, Wausau and Green Bay. 
Records also were expected to fall in the Upper Midwest, Weather service meteorologist Steven Fleegel said. As much as 25 inches of snow had been reported in northeastern South Dakota, with snowfall forecast to continue into Friday in that state, Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota. 
""We're calling it historic because of the widespread heavy snow,"" Mike Connelly, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota, said. 
An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as ""thunder snow"" -- snow accompanied by thunder and lightning -- was also reported Wednesday and Thursday in the central part of the state. 
The system created hazardous wildfire conditions in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. 
The threat of severe weather will shift this weekend to southern states including Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, including the cities of Houston, Dallas and New Orleans, according to the weather service's Storm Prediction Center. Threats will include damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes. 
In addition to the immediate impacts, the storm threatened to swell rivers in the Midwest that flooded after March's drenching, which caused billions of dollars in flood damage in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota. Forecasters aren't expecting similar flooding this time around thanks to the absence of a wet snowpack on frozen ground.","The storm has made travel hazardous across Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota",2019-04-11T21:37:44Z,Spring blizzard knocks out power to tens of thousands,CBS News,0

"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro begins a second term in office on Thursday in defiance of international criticism that his reelection last year was illegitimate, further isolating the South American country where an economic crisis is fueling a humanitarian emergency. 
Leaders from the ruling Socialist Party have disavowed criticism of Maduro’s inauguration, which will keep him at the helm of the OPEC oil exporter until 2025, calling for rallies of support and promoting him on social media with Twitter hashtags such as #Iampresident. 
Opposition leaders, however, have portrayed Thursday’s inauguration as the moment at which Maduro will be internationally branded a dictator following a widely boycotted 2018 election that governments around the world described as a farce. 
But continued support from the military, a chronically fractured opposition and a relentless crackdown on opposition critics means that Maduro appears to face few serious challenges at home, despite the international outcry. 
“They’ve tried to turn a constitutional swearing-in ceremony into a world war,” Maduro said during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. “But whether there’s rain, thunder or lightning, we’re going to triumph.” 
The ceremony is scheduled for 10 a.m. local time (1400 GMT) on Thursday. 
Maduro’s triumphalism echoes that of his predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who used abundant oil revenues to flood Venezuela with consumer goods while providing heavily subsidized food and medicine. 
That contrasts sharply with the Venezuela of today. 
Inflation is fast approaching 2 million percent, leaving a monthly minimum wage worth less than a carton of eggs. Some three million people have emigrated since 2015 - many on foot - to escape rising malnutrition and disease, according to the United Nations. 
Bank notes that once paid for months’ worth of groceries are now tossed in trash cans, piled into useless stacks or even woven into multi-colored women’s handbags sold by street merchants. 
Maduro last year won reelection despite the economic chaos in large part because the opposition boycotted the vote, in which Socialist Party activists openly made payments to voters within a stone’s throw of polling stations. 
SOUTH OSSETIA CELEBRATES 
Countries around the world condemned the vote, including the United States and Venezuela’s neighbors in Latin America, leaving Maduro backed by just a handful of stalwart allies from leftist governments. 
While few countries plan to shutter embassies or sever ties with the Maduro government, according to diplomatic sources, the vast majority will not send diplomats to the inauguration as is customary. 
The government feted the arrival of foreign dignitaries who traveled for the inauguration, including the president of South Ossetia - a disputed territory in the Caucasus region that is rarely described as nation. 
That sparked guffaws from opposition critics who called it a signal of isolation. 
Opposition activists have called for protests on Thursday. Authorities have responded by filling streets with police checkpoints and rifle-toting troops. 
Fury in 2017 over Maduro’s aggressive sidelining of the opposition-run Congress led to a four-month wave of protests that killed over 100 but failed to shake him from power and left his adversaries frustrated. 
“They’re trying to scare us so that we don’t protest,” said Henry Ramirez, 39, a computer engineer in the western city of San Cristobal, attempting to cut into a line for gasoline, the type of a queue that has become increasingly frequent amid the crisis. “Tomorrow the dictatorship continues.” 
While politically motivated demonstrations have faded, protests take place nearly every day to demand salary improvements, access to food and medicine, or improvements to spotty power and water services.

Less than 24 hours before Maduro’s swearing in, troops in the second largest city of Maracaibo fired tear gas at informal vendors who were defying an order not to set up stalls at a market in the city center. The vendors later looted nearby shops. 
“Maduro is going to be sworn in and I don’t think it changes anything,” said Angela Perez, 26, who works the cash register at a fast-food restaurant in the city of Valencia, adding she does not sympathize with Maduro or his critics.

"KABUL/MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghanistan’s summer harvest will be one of the most critical in years, especially of wheat, its biggest cereal crop, as the country recovers from floods and the worst drought in decades, government and aid organization officials say. 
Ample snow and rain during winter partly replenished soil moisture and raised hopes for a better wheat crop, which is a food source for rural families who turn their harvested grain into bread. Last year, however, drought displaced hundreds of thousands of people and also forced farmers who stayed in their homes to sell livestock and tools to survive, making recovery a multi-year challenge. 
Many farmers were unable to plant crops last year because of parched conditions. [nL4N1U03AW] 
Jabbar, 44, a farmer in Balkh province in northern Afghanistan, sold sheep, cows and one camel at discounted prices to buy food for his family of 12. Recent floods washed away some of his land that had been planted with peas and wheat. 
“I have a big family so it’s my responsibility to feed them. If it rains or not, it is harmful to us,” he said, referring to the double damage inflicted by drought and flood. 
“I hope I can get good results this year.” 
Floods in March complicated the recovery. Heavy rains killed at least 63 people and destroyed or damaged more than 12,000 homes, affecting 119,600 people, according to the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
Some 243,000 people remain displaced from last year’s drought in the western provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor, according to OCHA. Many have moved to urban areas where they live in tents on public and private lands, creating tensions with landowners. 
“If the harvest is OK, that will help communities come out of a terribly bleak period. If it’s not OK, we’ll need a massive injection of food quickly,” said Toby Lanzer, the U.N.’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan. 
The winter wheat harvested in June and July will need to help feed displaced people and some 10.6 million people who are struggling to find enough food where they live, Lanzer said. 
Farming accounts for one-third of the country’s economy, although only 12 percent of its land is arable. 
The wheat crop’s outlook remains uncertain, said Agriculture Minister Nasir Ahmad Durrani, in an interview on March 20. If the temperature warms too rapidly, melting snow could create floods that wipe out ripe crops, he said. 
It is also unclear how much wheat farmers were able to plant last autumn, said Rajendra Aryal, the representative in Afghanistan for the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 
Many farmers used wheat seed to make bread to survive, rather than save it for planting, Aryal said. 
“The people were already poor,” he said. “It will be very difficult if the harvest fails, so I don’t even want to think that way.” 
The floods also damaged critical farm infrastructure, such as irrigation canals, reservoirs and wells. The Afghan government is working to repair damaged infrastructure, especially in the provinces of Kandahar and Farah, Durrani said. 
Afghanistan produced 3.6 million tonnes of wheat last year, down 25 percent from the five-year average, according to the FAO. 
The country dipped into its grain reserve last year for 190,000 tonnes of wheat, leaving just 50,000 tonnes left, Durrani said. 
The expected shortfall between supply and demand this year will be made up through wheat imports from countries including Pakistan and Kazakhstan, he said. 
Abdul Majid Khan, who coordinates aid related to food security and agriculture for the U.N., said a plan is in place to assist families who return home as the drought abates. It includes food assistance, cash for work and farm supplies, but the plan still requires approval from international donors.

“My biggest concern is delays in funding,” he said. “We can lose the trust of the people.” 
A significant number of families should be able to return, as long as it is safe, said Zlatan Milisic, country director for the World Food Programme. 
“There are no more resilient people on Earth,” U.N. Representative Lanzer said about Afghans. “But goodness me, it is being tested.”

"MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - European and Latin American leaders met on Thursday to seek a peaceful and political solution to Venezuela’s deepening crisis, while a U.S. admiral suggested socialist President Nicolas Maduro does not have the loyalty of many within his military. 
International pressure on Maduro to step down has intensified this week as a flood of EU members followed the U.S. move to recognise opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president of the economically shattered South American nation. 
Russia and China continue to back Maduro and have warned Washington and others not to intervene. 
Holding its inaugural meeting in Uruguay’s capital Montevideo, the European Union-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela called for a more hands-off approach than that advocated by the United States and some other Latin American nations. 
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the group, launched late last month, was pushing for a peaceful and political solution, adding that a resolution ultimately must come from the people of Venezuela. 
“This is not only the most desirable result but is the only result if we want to avoid more suffering and a chaotic process,” Mogherini said in Montevideo alongside Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez. 
“The biggest dilemma facing Venezuela is between peace and war, which is why we are insisting in our call for calm from the parties involved and the prudence of the international community,” Vazquez said. 
In power since 2013 and re-elected last year in a vote critics have called a sham, Maduro has presided over an economic collapse marked by widespread shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation. An estimated 3 million Venezuelans have left the oil-rich OPEC-member country. 
The group meeting in Montevideo said it wants a process within 90 days in which Venezuelans determine their own future through free elections. Some critics have said this stance could let Maduro off the hook. 
EU member states in the group include France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain. Latin America members include Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay. 
Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup, has maintained power with the backing of Venezuela’s military, though the opposition leader has asked the military to side with the forces of democracy. 
In Washington, Navy Admiral Craig Faller, head of the U.S. military’s Southern Command, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the majority of Venezuela’s 2,000 generals were loyal to Maduro because of the wealth they amassed from drug trafficking and petroleum and business revenue. But Faller said rank-and-file soldiers were starving “just like the population.” 
“The legitimate government of President Guaido has offered amnesty, and a place for the military forces, most of which we think would be loyal to the constitution, not to a dictator, a place to go,” Faller told the hearing. 
Faller said the U.S. military is prepared to protect American personnel and diplomatic facilities in Venezuela if needed, though he did not provide any details. 
‘THIS USURPATION’ 
Guaido has galvanized the opposition since taking over as head of Venezuela’s National Assembly in January. Last month, he declared himself interim president, opening the door for Washington and others to recognise him as the legitimate leader. 
“Naturally I appeal to all of those who can help us ... to help put an end to this usurpation of a transition government, and bring truly free elections to Venezuela as soon as possible,” Guaido told the Sky24 television channel in Italy. 
On Monday, the so-called Lima Group, which includes Canada, Brazil, Argentina and other nations that have taken a harder line towards Maduro but not the United States, encouraged international pressure to force Maduro to step down. 
The International Monetary Fund, which a new government in Caracas would likely call on for financial assistance, is awaiting guidance from its member countries on whether to recognise Guaido, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday. 
“I think countries are still establishing their positions in terms of recognition,” Rice told a regular news briefing. 
Some nations, including participants at the meeting in Uruguay, remain wary about getting too directly involved in the Venezuela’s dispute. 
On the eve of the meeting, Mexico, Uruguay and a grouping of Caribbean countries presented a plan for Venezuela, titled the “Montevideo Mechanism,” that calls for a peaceful solution that will prevent an “escalation of violence.” 
Mexico, once an outspoken critic of Maduro, also is urging negotiations to end the crisis. Ties with Venezuela have warmed under leftist Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who invited Maduro to his inauguration last month.

"ABUJA (Reuters) - Lying in bushes by the side of a road, the security officer played dead and hoped the militants would mistake the blood pooling from a colleague’s body as his own. He did not risk looking up to see what was happening, but he could hear. 
“We warned you civilians not to take part in elections, but you refused,” said a fighter loyal to the extremist group Islamic State. “Cut their throats.” 
Kashim Shettima, governor of the war-torn northeastern Nigerian state of Borno, issued a statement two days later saying three people were killed when insurgents attacked his motorcade on route to an election rally. 
But survivors of the Feb. 12 assault, along with two Nigerian and two international security personnel, put the toll much higher. 
Reuters was unable to confirm precise figures. One survivor said he saw about 40 bodies; another estimated that as many as 100 died. The militants also took between 100 and 200 people captive, officials said. 
The scale of the attack raises concern about the ability of militants from Boko Haram and a breakaway group calling itself Islamic State West African Province to disrupt voting in a delayed presidential election on Saturday, despite government assurances that only remnants of the insurgency remain. 
“Islamic State and Boko Haram have over the past weeks ceaselessly warned locals that voting in the elections is tantamount to apostasy,” said Fulan Nasrullah, a researcher who tracks the groups at the Global Initiative For Civil Stabilisation, a Nigerian-based think tank. “They have both explicitly threatened to attack the voters who go out to vote in these communities or who work with the electoral commission or otherwise carry out activities in support of the elections.” 
Others interviewed by Reuters asked not to be identified because they said the government and military command had ordered them not to discuss the ambush, which could be damaging to both Shettima, a government politician, and Buhari. The president, who is seeking a second term, has vowed to defeat the insurgents once and for all. 
A spokesman for the state governor did not respond to requests for comment on the accounts provided to Reuters, saying there might be a response later. A regional military spokesman referred questions to the state government. 
Buhari urged Nigerians “to go out and vote,” assuring them in a televised address on Friday that adequate security measures were in place. 
FATAL CHOICE 
 Shettima’s motorcade left the state capital Maiduguri in the morning, bound for the market towns of Mafa, Dikwa and Gamboru. The 85-vehicle convoy included buses full of supporters headed to campaign events, officials said. 
 In Dikwa, the local army commander urged the governor to stop for the night, according to one of the survivors and a Nigerian security official. Dusk was approaching, and the risk of an ambush was too high. 
But Shettima decided to press on, they said. The governor’s office did not answer questions about the decision. 
At 6:45 pm, as the convoy snaked past the village of Maula, dozens of fighters armed with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked. It was unclear how they found the convoy. 
Survivors heard grenades slam into the middle of the convoy, followed by a hail of bullets. The governor, who was in the front half of the convoy, escaped, they said, but those riding at the back were trapped. 
“They then came out with two pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns, all of the fighters in military camouflage, while the rest of them came from the roadside, firing on us,” said a security official who was part of the motorcade. 
Some people tried to escape by turning back. Others abandoned their vehicles and ran into the bush. 
“As they ran, the insurgents opened fire,” the official said. “I would not be surprised if 100 people lost their lives.” 
‘CUT THEIR THROATS’ 
Lying in the bushes next to his colleague’s body, the officer who was playing dead heard the militants begin to gather survivors by the roadside. 
    There, as the wrecks of the convoy vehicles smoldered, some were killed, he said. He later saw two fresh bodies, their throats slit. 
The fighters ordered other survivors into the remaining vehicles and drove away with at least 100 people, said one of the witnesses and an international security official who looked into the attack. A Nigerian intelligence official put the number of captives as high as 200. 
After the insurgents were gone, the hiding officer joined a flood of survivors fleeing through the bush, making for nearby towns and a military base. More than 200 men and women managed to escape, trekking through the night, another witness said. 
The intelligence official and other security personnel corroborated the witnesses’ accounts. 
    At least 60 bodies were taken to a hospital morgue in Maiduguri after the attack, some with their throats cut, said a humanitarian worker who looked into the incident. A morgue official declined to comment. 
It wasn’t immediately clear whether any Islamic State fighters were killed. 
“SUPREME PRICE” 
    The ambush was part of a surge of attacks as Islamic State and Boko Haram seek to sow chaos during the election. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced since December. 
    Last Saturday, the day voting was supposed to take place before it was delayed for logistical reasons, six people were killed in a bomb blast in Maiduguri. 
There have also been reports of dozens of people abducted from buses as they returned to their home areas to vote. The state government and military authorities declined to comment on those reports. 
The morning after the ambush, soldiers returned to the scene, said one of the security officials who survived the attack. There, they recovered the body of one soldier, two civilians and 23 vehicles, leaving soon after. 
The troops did not check far inside the bush, the survivor said. 
    On Tuesday, Shettima told reporters in the capital Abuja that he would return after the election to Gamboru - the town his convoy had tried to reach - “ready to pay the supreme price if need be”.

"A big trough of low pressure is sweeping across the United States this week, bringing heavy snow and whiteout conditions to one side of the country and flooding rain to the other.
On the cold side of the storm, Arctic air is spilling into the Lower 48 and heavy snow is pounding parts of the Central U.S. The heaviest snow is coming down in the Dakotas and New Mexico as much as two feet in the high elevations.
The storm is also generating strong winds alongside the snow, prompting the National Weather Service to issue blizzard warnings for parts of New Mexico, South Dakota and western Minnesota. Wind gusts from 50 to 80 mph are in the forecast.
Blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely, the Weather Service in Aberdeen, S.D., wrote Friday. This will lead to whiteout conditions, making travel extremely dangerous. 
More snow will fall on top of Thursdays totals from central Minnesota to Michigans Upper Peninsula, and the storm will generate lake-effect snow downwind of the Great Lakes over the next several days.

"After ABC saw a bump in ratings following the hostless 2019 Oscars, the network’s premiere late-night host and 2018 Academy Awards host, Jimmy Kimmel, addressed the numbers and posited a theory about the viewership.
Kimmel addressed the ratings disparity during the opening monologue for his post-awards show on Monday. The former host joked that he watched the show from his home in full tuxedo and makeup in cast they called him asking for a last-minute headliner. However, ABC opted for no host, which many believe is responsible for cutting down significantly the runtime of the notoriously late-running broadcast.
OSCARS: QUEEN, LADY GAGA-BRADLEY COOPER PERFORMANCES SHINE, 'GREEN BOOK' WINS BEST PICTURE
“The show was 36 minutes shorter than last year, which people like I guess,” Kimmel said in his opening monologue Monday. “Next year it’s going to be 36 minutes shorter than that, and every year they’ll cut 36 more minutes out of the show until it’s one minute long and the ratings will be huge.”
He continued: “I tried pitching having no host for this show tonight, but ABC didn’t go for it.”
In lieu of a host who would continually cut in with jokes and bits to entertain the crowd and break up the monotony of divvying up the awards, the show opted to spend a lot of time on musical performances, with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper singing their hit from “A Star is Born,” Jennifer Hudson singing “I’ll Fight,” and Queen opening the show with Adam Lambert.
OSCARS 2019 WINNERS LIST
“Last night’s show, the Oscars, boy there was an awful lot of singing last night,” Kimmel joked. “The theme for the Oscars last night was ‘the Grammys.’”
The hostless 2019 Academy Awards bounced back from last year’s all-time ratings low to average 29.6 million viewers, according to TheWrap.
The politically charged 2018 edition hosted by Kimmel dropped 20 percent compared to the previous year and attracted 26.5 million viewers. It was the first time that the Oscars averaged fewer than 30 million people since at least 1974, when Nielsen started keeping track.

"Senate Republicans on Monday blasted their Democratic colleagues for blocking a disaster relief bill that was intended to help Midwestern regions affected by flooding because it supposedly didn’t go far enough to help Puerto Rico.
The bill, originally sponsored by Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., proposed $13.5 billion in relief funding for areas recently hit by natural disasters. The 44-49 vote fell short of a majority, and far short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster. 
PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR CAUTIONS WHITE HOUSE: 'IF THE BULLY GETS CLOSE, I'LL PUNCH THE PULLY IN THE MOUTH'
Democrats want to add almost $700 million more to unlock further disaster aid for Puerto Rico and several states, including help to rebuild badly damaged water systems. Democrats are also trying to force the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in rebuilding funds that have already been approved.
Republicans accused Democrats of playing partisan politics.
“Disaster funding should not be a partisan issue, yet for months, Congress has repeatedly played politics with much-needed aid at the expense of local communities in Florida, Puerto Rico, and around the nation that are struggling to recover,” tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the proposed funding “would not have left anyone in the lurch from Iowa to Puerto Rico.” He accused the Democrats of being hypocritical for decrying “Washington political games while on the campaign trail in Iowa, but then return to the Capitol only to play political games themselves.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused Democrats of holding up relief funds and argued that another relief package passed in the House earlier this year would be vetoed by the president.
""This is no time for my colleagues across the aisle to prioritize a political fight with the president ahead of the urgent needs of communities across America,” McConnell said before the vote Monday.

TRUMP MOVES TO CUT AID TO CENTRAL AMERICA, AMID CARAVANS AND FLOOD OF REFUGEES
President Trump, who has openly criticized Puerto Rico’s government, has denied Democratic demands for more aid to the U.S. territory, which was slammed by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.
Trump fired off a round of tweets Monday in which he criticized Puerto Rico’s government for incompetence and corruption.
“The people of Puerto Rico are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp; Florida combined, yet their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess – nothing works.”
Trump said last week that his administration had sent $91 billion to Puerto Rico, while only $29 billion had gone to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricane.
""(Puerto Rico) has to spend the money wisely,"" Trump said. ""They don't know how to spend the money and they're not spending it wisely.""
GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The path forward is not clear, but a leading option is for the Senate to pass a much more narrowly drawn bill simply to get the issue into a House-Senate conference committee. House Democrats insist the talks must produce a final measure with help for Puerto Rico.

"LOS ANGELES -- Authorities were keeping a wary eye Friday on fire-scarred Southern California hillsides after a storm brought flooding fears and prompted evacuation orders for hundreds of homes, some of which were later downgraded to voluntary. Thursday's second storm in a week dropped record-breaking rains on downtown Los Angeles, jammed major roads and sent an airliner skidding off a runway, but no major injuries were reported. Evacuations were ordered for areas of Orange and Riverside counties ravaged by a summer wildfire. Black, surging torrents choked with downed trees and mud swept down channels near homes and in one case swept across a bridge and took out a guardrail. Other areas saw foot-deep mud or water. No homes were seriously damaged. Even though the storm eased by nightfall, evacuation orders for hundreds of homes in Trabuco Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains south of Los Angeles and for a few neighborhoods in the Lake Elsinore area east of Los Angeles remained in place overnight. Other Lake Elsinore areas had their mandatory evacuation orders downgraded to voluntary evacuation warnings late Thursday night, although fire officials said there was still a potential for dangerous conditions and urged residents to remain vigilant. Also in Lake Elsinore, firefighters worked into the night lining a street with sandbags to protect homes.

Kotler, who wielded water hoses to beat back the flames in November, used a tractor to keep the debris from entering his home. ""Saving my house once again,"" said Kotler, 57, a lifelong Malibu resident. ""I'm more than a little concerned. If we get another blast of heavy rain there'll be no stopping the hill from coming down."" At Hollywood Burbank Airport, about 15 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, nobody was hurt when a Southwest Airlines plane from Oakland skidded off a wet runway as it landed. The plane came to a stop in a graded area designed to slow aircraft that overshoot the runway, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California sorely need rainfall. Virtually the entire region is experiencing drought conditions, with portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties and areas along the Mexican border in extreme drought. The storm provided a big boost in and around Los Angeles. The downtown area set a new rainfall record for the day with 1.9 inches, nearly double the previous mark set in 1997, the National Weather Service reported. Normal monthly rainfall for December is only a bit more - 2.33 inches. Elsewhere, fire crews had to rescue a man from the flood-swollen Los Angeles River, a concrete flood control channel, and helped motorists to safety in several areas where cars became stuck in flooded intersections. While rain caused numerous accidents and backups on L.A.-area freeways, heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley. The hours-long shutdown along the key north-south route caused backups for miles. Motorists were urged to use caution on mountain passes, where up to 6 feet of snow was predicted at higher elevations. Forecasters said the end of the storm would be followed by a ridge of high pressure that will bring dry and warm conditions to the area through the weekend, but another storm system could move in early next week.",Mandatory evacuations remain in several areas after second storm in week brought record-breaking downpours,2018-12-07T09:14:38Z,"Mudslides, flooding still feared after heavy rain in wildfire-scorched SoCal areas",CBS News,1

"At least three people died following a deluge that brought chaos to Australias largest city Wednesday. The downpours during Sydneys morning commute shut down roads and snarled traffic, while strong winds knocked out power to thousands. News.com.au described it as a storm of epic proportions and reported that officials conducted more than a dozen high-water rescues due to stranded vehicles. Sydney received 3.3 inches (84.6 millimeters) of rain in less than two hours more than its typical output for the entire month of November, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Several locations measured upward of 4 inches (100 millimeters) of rain. It was Sydneys wettest November day since 1984, according to Australias Bureau of Meteorology. While flooding rain was the most widespread hazard, reports emerged of damaging winds. During the storm, an office building had its windows blown out by a mini cyclone according to ABC News Australia. The storminess was spurred by a strong zone of low pressure, both at the surface and higher altitudes. The clockwise flow around the pressure system drew extremely moist air off the South Pacific Ocean into Sydney, fueling the downpours. While Sydney was soaked by rain caused by the low-pressure system, a dome of high pressure parked over the northern part of Australia caused extreme heat, especially over northern Queensland, where records were set. Temperatures have been 5 to 10 degrees Celsius above average and some records have not just been broken, they have been smashed, reported ABC News Australia. The extreme heat intensified brushfires flaring up in the region. Around 200 fires are burning in Queensland and, for the first time, a catastrophic fire warning was issued for parts of the region.

The foul flood was caused by a blockage in a giant pipe that collects 80 percent of the sewage in the San Juan de Lurigancho district. Adding a political element, the pipe was relocated about six years ago by Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant that is at the heart of a corruption scandal engulfing elites across Latin America, including Peru.
""It has become clogged: strange material has entered the collector,"" said President Martin Vizcarra, who pledged to find those responsible and declared a health emergency.
Vizcarra said the pipe is buried at a depth of nine meters (30 feet) and it ""began to sink,"" with dirty water flowing into low-lying areas of San Juan de Lurigancho, which has more than 1 million inhabitants.
More than 100 police officers rode horses through the waters while dozens of giant suction machines pulled up sewage.
Maria Cruz, 80, cried as she used a bucket of clean water to wash two small dolls that had adorned the top of her wedding cake decades ago.
""You can't even breath here,"" she said.
The flooding began Sunday when millions of liters (gallons) of sewage spilled across more than eight hectares (20 acres) of the borough, reaching depths of two meters (6½ feet), officials said.
""We are worried by the pollution,"" said resident Oswaldo Vasquez. Neighbors complained of dirty water coming out of their taps and toilets.
While officials have not yet determined who is responsible for the flooding, Vizcarra said the builder of a public works project is responsible for any defect in it for the next seven years.
""And this project doesn't have seven years,"" he added.
Mayra Cardenas of the communications office of Odebrecht's office in Peru said: ""We will not comment.""","Amid an unbearable stench in Peru's capital, thousands of workers, police and soldiers are struggling to contain and clean up a flood of sewage that has caused a health emergency in one of Lima's most populous districts",2019-01-16T21:56:00Z,Unbearable stench: Giant sewage spill befouls Peru's capital,ABC News,0
"Record-breaking, historic, even Biblical — that's how many are describing the scale of flooding in the Midwest, where thousands of people in Iowa and Nebraska have been forced to flee their homes. In a region that's no stranger to rising floodwaters, a perfect storm of melting snow, ""bomb cyclone"" rain and climate change conspired to push these floods over the top.
As of Monday, 100 river gauges in the Midwest and Mississippi River valleys remained at major or moderate flood stage, with many in record-setting territory. This weekend, the Missouri River at Plattsmouth, Nebraska — just south of Omaha — crested 4 feet above its highest recorded level. 
So how did this happen?
The 2018-2019 winter has been defined by a fairly consistent, stubborn pattern featuring two distinct weather regimes. In the West, a roaring Pacific jet stream brought relentless storms and colder-than-normal temperatures. In the East, the opposite weather dominated, with mild and relatively quiet conditions. Separating the two regimes was a persistent storm track propelling storm after storm over the Midwest.
This persistent weather pattern, boosted by a weak El Nino, combined for the wettest winter on record across the U.S. In Minneapolis, snowfall measured 20 inches above normal, while Omaha registered its snowiest season on record. As a result, the ground was saturated and frozen — making the region a sitting duck for last week's bomb cyclone.
The bomb cyclone was itself a historic event, with wind gusts close to 100 mph and record-setting low pressure. It dropped blinding snowfall on its western side in Colorado, and heavy rains in the eastern Plains and Midwest. But those impacts paled in comparison to the flooding it triggered.
With a dense layer of snow blanketing areas from Nebraska and Missouri to Wisconsin, the heavy rains couldn't seep into the frozen ground. Along with melting snow, the rain instead became runoff that caused rivers to swell. Further complicating matters, thick ice jams clogged the flow of the water, causing it to spill over onto adjacent land.  
While this confluence of events can and does happen in a normal climate, a warmed climate makes it all the more likely. That's because there is more energy and moisture available.
Last week's bomb cyclone had a low-pressure equivalent to that of a category 2 hurricane. That kind of low pressure is occasionally seen in Nor'easters, but rarely if ever in storms in the lower Plain states. This follows what is expected as the climate changes — spiked storms, with more extremes.
A warmer climate has led to heavier rainfall. Since the early 1900s, annual precipitation has ticked up by 15 to 20 percent in the Upper Midwest. But the more important number is the increase in rainfall from the most extreme weather events, which have dropped nearly 40 percent more rain since 1958.
Trends in heavy rain events since earlier in the 1900s. Not only is annual rainfall increasing, but much of that extra rainfall is falling in a few yearly extreme rainfalls. That is how climate change loads the dice. #MetsUnite! pic.twitter.com/8m3p18kT69
— Meteorologists United on Climate Change (@MetsUnite) March 18, 2019
While an increase in rain can be absorbed by the ground if that rainfall is spread out over the course of the year, additional rain on top of already heavy events magnifies flooding.
In the case of extreme rain, the connection to climate change is simple: Warmer ocean waters evaporate more moisture into the air. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. That extra moisture falls as heavier rain. This effect was vividly on display in hurricanes like Harvey and Florence, when rain totals shattered all-time records.
Research shows the Midwest is feeling a disproportionate impact from heavier flooding. Going forward, global climate models continue to project areas like the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast will see the greatest increases in yearly precipitation in the U.S.

"Winslow, Neb. — More rain fell Monday across the central Plains, providing no relief from historic floods. At least three people have died since rivers started overflowing and it won't let up for the rest of the week. At least 15 states are under watches and warnings as floodwaters push downstream toward the Mississippi River Valley.
Doug and Eric Alberts are trying to round up the surviving hogs on their 9-acre farm in Fremont, Nebraska. There aren't many. The family estimates they were only able to save 14 out of 700 of their livestock.
The father and son have worked for three years to build this business. Then, a few days ago, the water came.
""About a 3-foot wall ... 100-foot wide ... just flowing over the road,"" Doug recalled.
Within minutes, 7 feet of water covered their farm.
CBS News
When the men returned Tuesday, they found dead hogs everywhere.
""Honestly, I didn't expect to see nothing alive, from the pictures we'd seen,"" Eric told CBS News. ""When we came in with the boat and it was still 5 feet deep... we didn't expect nothing to be here.""
Throughout the Farm Belt, it's the same story of devastation. The same images of loss. In Nebraska alone, more than 17 areas saw record flooding. There were 65 counties and four tribal areas have issued emergency declarations. Homes have been wiped out. It's estimated farm losses could exceed $1 billion.

Unlike many farmers, the Alberts have some insurance, but it will only cover a small part of the damage.
""A lot of hard work, start over and hopefully in a year we'll be able to sell hogs again,"" Doug said.
Nebraska's governor called this the worst flood damage in state history. In Winslow, a building floated into someone's backyard and cars are scattered in the mud. Roads and railways are impassable. As the weather warms and snow melts, more flooding is expected in places like North Dakota and Minnesota.

"(Reuters) - Missouri farmer Richard Oswald needs a lot of help to recover from flooding that left his home and farm looking like a manmade island in an inland sea. 
Relief groups are giving tetanus shots and handing out free meals and cleaning supplies near his farm in the Langdon-Rock Port area, about 100 miles (161 km) northwest of Kansas City. But what Oswald really needs is money. 
Hit by the worst flooding in living memory, he and thousands of other farmers along the Missouri River will each require hundreds of thousands of dollars in disaster funds or loans to start over. 
“The typical response on flood relief is groups like the Red Cross show up with paper towels and rubber gloves and scrub buckets,” said Oswald, 69, who does not expect to be able to get to his home or land for weeks. “The biggest thing farmers need is cash, or ways to access funds.” 
‘BOUNCE BACK’ 
Slammed by a trade war and low commodity prices, Midwest family farms have been in the red and in decline for the last five years. The number of U.S farms fell by 100,000 between 2010 and 2017, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data. 
Thousands more will now go under without emergency financial support for flooding, pummeling heartland economies almost entirely dependent on agriculture, farmers and aid groups said. 
It is a call federal and state agencies, as well as non-governmental and faith-based relief groups are answering. 
President Donald Trump has approved disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa, making federal disaster funding available in flood-hit areas. Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency, paving the way for similar actions in his state. 
“I know we aim for bringing everything back up to where it was,” said Rosalynn Days-Austin, a USDA emergency coordinator helping direct Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) efforts in flood-affected areas. “Sometimes that’s not always possible, for a variety of reasons, but the goal is definitely to help them bounce back from their loss.” 
CASH PREFERRED 
Relief groups like Farm Aid are tending to the immediate needs of farmers, distributing tens of thousands of dollars in “emergency grants” - $500 gifts from cash donations that help families pay for things like groceries. After that, the group and its partners advise farming families on how to access federal disaster funds they hope are coming soon. 
“What we’re hearing, because of the snowpack and rain and the wet ground, is that farmers are going to be dealing with this throughout the spring. So we’re in it for the long haul,” said Jennifer Fahy, a spokeswoman for the group established by country singer and activist Willie Nelson. 
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is coordinating a long-term response to get displaced families housed, navigate the red tape of insurance companies and federal agencies and tend to the mental health needs of people who have suffered extreme trauma, said Bishop Brian Maas. 
“We have national partners and coalitions within the state,” said Maas, who is asking people to hold off donating more material goods, for now. “There will be stresses because we’ve not done anything of this magnitude. 
“Now we have mountains of cleaning supplies and so forth that can’t be used,” Maas said, appealing to people to get back in touch in a month to see how they can donate then. “Cash is the most flexible way to respond.” 
‘FEMA IS WORTHLESS’ 
Another immediate need is feed for livestock. 
Relief organization Farm Rescue is collecting donations of hay in the Dakotas and trucking it to farmers whose cattle are starving after their feed stands were submerged in floodwater. 
“I don’t know of anything this widespread that has ever affected so many people in our service area,” said Dan Erdmann, a spokesman for the group which helps family farms get through crises ranging from natural disasters to medical emergencies. 
Farm workers, some of them undocumented and legal migrants, have been hit hard. Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska is looking at housing assistance for displaced people who previously paid around $300 a month rent and now face rents triple that due to a dearth in properties, said Stacy Martin, chief executive of the social services charity. 
While relief groups tend to urgent needs, farmers like Scott Olson say more federal relief money is needed at a time when low crop prices and high debt levels are limiting farmers’ access to credit. He is counting on a farm relief bill in Congress for extra disaster compensation after he successfully lobbied in Washington for similar funds following 2011 flooding. 
“Flood insurance isn’t going to cover this worth a darn. FEMA is worthless,” said Olson, who farms 3,000 acres near Tekamah, Nebraska and runs a farm equipment business. “They don’t have any money, nobody has any money.”

"(Reuters) - Large parts of Nebraska and the U.S. Central Plains were underwater on Saturday after a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm triggered historic flooding along the Missouri and Platte rivers, causing two deaths, tearing apart homes and swallowing roadways. 
The National Weather Service predicted dangerous flooding would continue through the weekend in Nebraska and in south and west central Iowa, particularly along the Missouri River. 
“We’re still in a very widely dispersed and intense flooding situation in the eastern third of Nebraska,” said Mike Wight, a spokesman for the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a phone interview. 
Nebraska has had two flood-related fatalities this week, Wight said. One person died at home after failing to evacuate, although the exact cause of death was unclear, authorities said, and the other was swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
The Missouri River was still rising on Saturday evening, local TV station KMTV reported, with a record crest of more than 47 feet expected early on Tuesday in Brownville, Nebraska, about 70 miles south of Omaha in the eastern corner of the state. 
“We’re looking at 4, 5, 6, 7 feet above the highest it’s ever been,” Wight said. 
The flooding came in the wake of what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm blew from the western Rockies to the Central Plains last week. 
The rising water has reduced stores and homes to rubble and ripped off a long chunk of a highway bridge, according to photos posted on Twitter by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Ranchers posted images on social media of their cattle being dug out of snowdrifts or stranded in fields. 
The flooding has all but blocked access to some small communities along the river, where potable drinking water has become scarce as the flood has contaminated wells, Wight said. 
Ricketts visited several flooded communities on Saturday and wrote on Twitter that he witnessed “unbelievable devastation.” 
“The whole state is pulling together as we respond to and recover from the ongoing #NebraskaFlood! #NebraskaStrong,” the governor tweeted.

"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Major flooding threatened several thousand homes on Monday in the Australian state of Queensland, forcing more than 1,100 people to be evacuated, after authorities opened up dam gates after days of torrential rains filled reservoirs to overflowing. 
Emergency services tackled thousands of calls from people overnight around the city of Townsville, where evacuation centers were filling up. Crocodiles were even spotted in suburban streets, pictures on social media showed. 
“Once in a century event happening here. I have never seen the likes of this before,” Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV, in a state often hit by cyclones and flooding. 
Palaszczuk said there could be thousands of homes affected by the flooding. 
A record 1.16 meters (3.8 ft) of rain has fallen across the Townsville area over the past seven days, with another 100 millimeters expected to be dumped over the area on Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. 
Major flood warnings have been posted for several rivers. 
The weather bureau warned of “dangerous and high velocity flows” along the Ross River after the flood gates were opened fully at the Ross River dam on Sunday, releasing about 1,900 cubic meters of water a second. 
Even after the release, as of Monday morning, the dam was still at 229 percent capacity, holding about 532,000 gigaliters of water, or roughly as much as Sydney Harbour. 
“We’re hoping to see an easing trend from tomorrow,” bureau spokeswoman Jess Gardner said, adding that the rains could move further south, towards Mackay, a major coal exporting area. 
Townsville, a major port for northern Australia, is the country’s top exporter of copper, zinc, lead and sugar. 
The Port of Townsville remains open, but cargo loadings have faced interruptions due to heavy rain, a port spokeswoman said. She did not have details on specific shipments held up. 
Global miner Glencore Plc, which exports copper, zinc and lead from Townsville said as of late last week there had been no impact on its operations.

SUBSCRIBE Dec. 4, 2018 / 9:25 PM GMT Des Moines, Iowa, might seem like an unusual place to premiere a documentary, unless of course youre thinking of running for president. Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday will introduce his latest film on the topic of climate change and be part of a panel discussion in the state, which kicks off the 2020 Democratic primary season in 14 months. Bloomberg hasnt said whether hell run, but many signs indicate that hes leaning more yes than no as it comes time for him to decide in the next few weeks. The former mayor of New York and founder of the Bloomberg business information empire spent $41 million on 24 House races during the midterms, according to The New York Times. He also registered as a Democrat this year and has funded plans seeking solutions to issues like gun violence, immigration and the opioid epidemic. Lately, Bloomberg has been using a relationship with the National Geographic channel to expand a local and international conversation about climate change. Paris to Pittsburgh uses Iowa and Florida as a backdrop to explain climate change and its effect on peoples lives while also highlighting Iowas solar industry to offer a hint of optimism. The documentary, which will air on National Geographic on Dec. 12, features a flood victim from Clarksville, Iowa, talking about losing his possessions, and the Orlando director of sustainability, Chris Castro, discussing floodwaters in Florida. The movie is less about doom and gloom, however, and more about actions people are taking to combat climate change. Headlines tend to focus on the lack of leadership in Washington on climate change but not enough attention gets paid to how much the rest of the country is doing, in red and blue states, to confront this challenge, Bloomberg told NBC News. By telling that story, the film drives home the message that fighting climate changes makes our economy stronger, creates jobs and saves lives by cleaning the air we breathe, and hopefully that will encourage even more people to act. Bloomberg noted that many people were not relying on government action. We need more leadership from Washington, but Americans arent waiting around for it, he said. The film gets its title from President Donald Trumps comment that he was representing the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris, in pulling out of the Paris climate accord. The documentary features the reaction of Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh, to those comments. It is the second project from Bloomberg, who appears to be making use of documentary storytelling as a way to soft launch himself to voters. From the Ashes, another documentary for National Geographic, tackled the coal industry and aired last year. Scott Mulhauser, founder of the communications firm Aperture Strategies and former deputy chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, said Bloomberg appears to be positioning himself as a leader who tries to solve problems and define himself in a way that's different from other potential candidates. ""My sense is, it's a continued part of a leadership play,"" Mulhauser said. ""Rather than looking at an issue in isolation, he's looking at it in concert with other pieces. My sense is the Bloomberg team would frame it as taking on issues, popular or not, and taking on tough challenges and trying to solve them.""

Midwestern governors declared states of emergency as severe weather and heavy rain affected parts of the region Friday.
The National Weather Service on Friday said flooding would affect parts of the Mississippi and Missouri valleys through Monday as a cold front that could end up affecting as many as 74 million Americans moved from the Rocky Mountains toward the East Coast.
Earlier this week the storm became what forecasters describe as a bombogenesis, or a bomb cyclone, where a front drops 24 millibars, or units of atmospheric pressure, in less than 24 hours.
The system was bringing with it not only 2 to 3 inches of rain but temperatures warm enough in some areas to melt snow and ice, which is contributing to flooding, officials and forecasters said. The front will reach the Mid-Atlantic on Sunday and is likely to produce rain there, too, according to the weather service.
Emergencies have been declared in parts of the Midwest because of flooding set off in by part by rapid snowmelt, officials said Friday.
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said his state was under an emergency declaration as a result of flooding that was enhanced by ""rapid snowmelt.""
Many residents and communities across our state have been responding to flooding that has impacted homes, businesses, and cities and towns across Wisconsin,"" Evers said in a statement. ""The warm temperatures and rain the last few days have caused much of the heavy snowpack and ice to melt resulting in flooding, ice jams, and rivers and creeks to rise.""
His declaration includes deployment of the Wisconsin National Guard for emergency response and recovery.
The city of Columbus, Wisconsin, which warned residents of rising flood waters at several locations, set up a shelter for those who wished to evacuate.
In Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly issued a state of emergency for Doniphan County where communities were also dealing with flooding.
""We urge residents to be aware of their safety,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""Floodwaters can be deceptive.""
The governor's office said the state's Emergency Operations Center had been activated and was working with federal authorities, including the weather service.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Friday as a result of flash flooding that has been impacting her state since midweek.
Qualifying households affected by the flooding could be eligible for as much as $5,000 in disaster relief, she said.
President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been in touch with Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts about the severe weather.
""The people of Nebraska &amp; across the Midwest, especially the Farmers &amp; Ranchers, are feeling the impacts from severe weather,"" he said. ""The first responders &amp; emergency response teams have done a great job dealing w/ record flooding, high winds, &amp; road closures.""

"The phrase pivot to video haunted digital journalists in 2016 and 2017, as publication after publication announced that they were laying off writers to redirect their resources into making videos. Mic, a digital publication focusing on a millennial audience, was one of the outlets that adopted this strategy. In 2017, the company laid off 25 people, mostly from news and editorial, to become the leader in visual journalism, founder Chris Altchek wrote at the time. The pivot, it seems, did not save them. On Thursday, Mic laid off most of its staff amid reports that the company is preparing to sell itself to Bustle Digital Group. But the pivot was just a symptom of a bigger problem how to make a digital journalism venture a profitable one. Mics other attempts to turn $60 million in venture funding into a sustainable business model also failed. Pivot or not, this ending was coming. The layoffs, first reported by Recode, were announced during a Thursday morning staff meeting with Altchek. According to one laid-off staffer, the meeting was brief and expected: Earlier media reports revealed the dire situation. The layoffs included Mics entire editorial team, video and written, the staffer said. The company, which was founded in 2011 as PolicyMic and rebranded to simply Mic in 2014, employed more than 100 people as of September. Mics traffic dropped precipitously over the past year. In April, Digiday reported that Mics website was down to 5 million monthly unique visitors. Just a year earlier that number was 17 million. None of Mics other sources of audience particularly Facebook were offsetting that steep drop. Mic Publisher Cory Haik announced in a note to staff that she was resigning from the company. Our business models are unsettled, and the macro forces at play are all going through their own states of unrest.I am proud to have been a part of an org that earnestly tried to solve some of these confounding issues. And I hope you all take some comfort in knowing that your work will transcend this moment."" The Wall Street Journal r eported in September that Mic was considering an acquisition offer from another media company, as executives believed the company would have to either sell or cut costs within a year. Earlier this week, Recode reported that Mics Facebook Watch show had been canceled, limiting the companys options even further. In an interview, Mics former executive editor Kerry Lauerman who also resigned from Mic said he was proud of the work Mics team achieved. Clearly there were some risks taken that didnt pay off. Today, the staff is really sad, but were enormously proud of the work weve done through it all,"" Lauerman said. He singled out the work of the Facebook Watch video team, noting that it had recently produced stories embedded in the migrant caravan. He also highlighted the work of Serena Daniari, a trans reporter who produced a series documenting what its like to be a trans person in a public space. (Lauerman and Haik are both former employees of The Washington Post.) Mic was one of many publications that pinned its hopes for growth on traffic that came via Facebook as it pushed to meet the expectations of its investors. Most newsrooms have come to regret making hiring and investment decisions based on the whims of a company that really doesnt care much about journalism, said Bill Grueskin, a professor at Columbia Journalism School. Facebook was often opaque toward its media partners. And in the case of average watch time on its videos, Facebook overestimated that key metric for two years. Mic wouldnt be the first site to have funders that are driving unrealistic growth targets, forcing the company into a relationship with such a dubious and fickle company, Grueskin added. Thursday was the latest version of a bleak ritual that has become standard when digital media companies purge their staffs, a ritual that has become more frequent since Facebooks announcement in January that its users would see fewer posts from publishers in their feeds. The Outline laid off six staffers over the summer, months after a $5 million funding round. LittleThings shut down in early 2018, before eventually being acquired and relaunched by another company. In February, Vox Media laid off about 50 employees. With each layoff, the fired staff writers and video producers flood Twitter, suddenly among the ranks of digital medias growing pool of freelancers and job hunters. And with each layoff, there seem to be fewer digital outlets that could hire them. The lessons that some publications, like Mic, learned the hard way are starting to sink in at others, according to Grueskin. As digital advertising increasingly becomes a space dominated by major tech companies like Facebook and Google, some publishers are starting to seek out other sources of revenue, including subscriptions, donations, events and apps. Once you move your media firm into that arena, your dependence on other platforms drops off, and you can treat Facebook with the same disdain that theyve treated newsrooms for years, Grueskin said.

"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday issued an injunction halting the Trump administration’s policy of sending some asylum seekers back across the southern border to wait out their cases in Mexico. 
The ruling is slated to take effect on Friday, according to the order by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco. The injunction will apply nationwide. 
The ruling removes at least temporarily a controversial Trump administration strategy aimed at slowing a flood of immigrants, mostly from Central America, that swelled last month to the highest level in a decade. 
Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention, many of the families are released to await U.S. immigration court hearings, a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs. In response, the Trump administration in January started sending some migrants to wait out their U.S. court dates in Mexican border cities. 
The Department of Homeland Security said last week that it planned to expand the program. 
A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Felipe's father, Agustin Gomez, had seized “the opportunity” to travel to the Mexico border in hopes of migrating to the U.S. after hearing a rumor, according to Felipe’s stepsister, Catarina Gomez Lucas.
""We heard rumors that they could pass (into the United States). They said they could pass with the children,"" Lucas told the Associated Press.
""We need a sober-minded, nonpartisan look at our immigration laws to really confront and grapple with the fact that children and families are coming into this cycle, that’s first and foremost,"" McAleenan said Sunday.
Separately, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he would push for hearings to probe the childrens' deaths, as well as the reasons they were brought across the the border. Last week, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein had called on Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to take that step.
""I’m going to hold hearings on the deaths of these two children and the policies that entice people to come,"" Graham said.
Fox News has learned that Graham is set to meet with President Trump soon at the White House to discuss Syria policy and other issues. Fox News has also learned that behind the scenes this weekend, several senators are discussing a new potential compromise to end the ongoing partial federal government shutdown.
One bipartisan proposal is to provide $5.7 billion in funding for the border wall, as well as a congressional reauthorization of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children, along with some other immigration provisions. There has also been talk about a special allowance for some classes of Central American refugees to be granted a more robust asylum status.
But despite the compromise talks, partisan tension remains high in Washington. After news of Felipe's death, top Democrats rushed to seemingly blame the Trump administration, even as key details remained unclear.
""Heartbroken and sickened by this news,"" New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich wrote on Twitter. ""I am urgently demanding more details, but the Trump administration must be held accountable for this child’s death and all the lives they have put in danger with their intentional chaos and disregard for human life.""
""We need a sober-minded, nonpartisan look at our immigration laws.""
 CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan
McAleenan added: ""We also need to invest in Central America. The State Department’s announcement of an unprecedented increase in aid, I think, is a tremendous step forwards.""
President Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut aid to Central American countries he maintains are not doing enough to curb illegal migration. ""Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S.,"" he wrote in October. ""We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.""
On Dec. 28, Trump renewed that pledge on Twitter: ""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""
U.S. immigration authorities said Wednesday that they have done new medical checks on virtually every child being held by the Border Patrol following the deaths.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Wednesday afternoon that she has ordered “extraordinary protective measures” after Felipe's death, which occured in immigration custody.
Border authorities did not disclose the results of the health checks.
But Nielsen said in a statement to Fox News that she had asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate what she says is an “uptick in sick children crossing our borders.” She also wants the U.S. Coast Guard to examine the medical programs offered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that detained Felipe and his father for a week.

Nielsen pledged that all children in the future will receive a “more thorough” medical screening after they are apprehended.
The U.S. government’s system for detaining migrants crossing the border is under strain, and the U.S. is seeing a sharp rise in families with children.
Nielsen on Wednesday blamed “a system that prevents parents who bring their children on a dangerous illegal journey from facing consequences for their actions.”
Her department argues that it must detain more people to discourage other Central American families from trying to migrate.
“As a result of bad judicial rulings from activist judges and inaction by Congress, we are seeing a flood of family units and unaccompanied alien children,” Nielsen’s statement continued.

"(CNN) Why did the salmon cross the road? Simple. To have babies, at least according to Alexis Leonard, a fish hatchery specialist, who recorded the video of more than a dozen salmon swimming across a flooded US Highway 101 in Shelton, Washington, Saturday. Leonard and her father were headed back to Eells Springs Trout Hatchery when they came across the first salmon. ""We kind of saw one fish dart across the road,"" she said. Leonard recorded the video for her sister, who had never seen fish swimming across a road, and also posted it on Facebook. The video quickly went viral. As of Monday night, it had more than 1,200 views. This isn't an unusual occurrence in Washington, Leonard said. Salmon in the area typically come from the Skokomish River and inhabit the creeks in order to spawn, or have babies. When there's heavy rain, Leonard said, the creeks flood, sending the fish everywhere. ""If they're lucky, it'll meet up with the creek on the other side of the road, if they're not they're stranded,"" Leonard said. Leonard, who has been working in hatcheries since 2015, also said the fish population at area hatcheries often explodes because of heavy rain and fish crossing the road. ""You can go from a few fish to a few thousand fish overnight,"" she said.

"This past Christmas, a man in Vacaville, Calif., learned a grim, but useful, holiday lesson: Sometimes, dont spread glad tidings. Keep the good news to yourself.
It was Dec. 20, and the city of about 100,000, located midway between Sacramento and San Francisco, was festooned with white lights and toy reindeer. Hoping to get his hands on a bit of extra cash for the holidays, the Vacaville man went to a Lucky grocery store and paid $30 for a scratch-off lottery ticket that odds said would leave him at a loss.
But the ticket turned out to be a winner, and promised to flood his bank account with $10,000, or so he thought. The lucky lottery contestant couldnt contain his excitement. He returned home to tell his two roommates of his financial success.
He would rue the day he ignored the warning of Shakespeares King Lear to, Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes.
The next morning, he reported to the Sacramento district office of the California State Lottery to collect his winnings. But the ticket he presented was not a winner.
Suspecting that one of his roommates had purloined the winning ticket while he was sleeping, the man went to the local police department, which recounted the episode Tuesday on Facebook. Chris Polen, a spokesman with the Vacaville Police Department, said authorities werent naming the man at his request.
It didnt take long for police to unwind the mystery of the good ticket gone bad. The following day, on Dec. 22, the mans 35-year-old roommate, Adul Saosongyang, attempted to cash in on a winning scratch-off ticket at the same lottery office in Sacramento, police said.
But the winning ticket wasnt worth a meager $10,000, the roommate was told. It was worth $10 million.
California lottery officials, yet to be informed that a ticket had been reported stolen, nevertheless began a routine investigation, conducted for all winnings of $600 and up. Collecting a prize of such a sum involves submitting a detailed claim form, either in person at a district office or else in the mail, according to the state lottery.
The lottery investigator who went to the Lucky in Vacaville to view video surveillance footage of the original Dec. 20 purchase learned that the ticket may have been stolen, according to the police departments account. Theft of lottery tickets is relatively common. Numerous scratch-off winners have later been unmasked for stealing the tickets, either from friends or from the grocery stores where they were employed.
The lottery is a magnet for elaborate scams. But cases like this show that the high-stakes contest can also motivate more petty forms of personal betrayal.
The lottery investigator teamed up with a Vacaville detective to get to the bottom of things. Who had purchased the initial scratch-off game? Who was responsible for the ticket presented the following day? And who was destined for the $10 million?
What they uncovered was an elaborate attempt by Saosongyang to seize his roommates reward. He had purchased a similar scratch card, and then swapped it out for the winning ticket while his unsuspecting roommate was sleeping.
On Monday, the investigator summoned Saosongyang to the Sacramento office to collect his winnings. Instead of rejoicing in the windfall, however, he was arrested by Vacaville police, who had obtained a warrant for him on the charge of grand theft. He was booked at the Sacramento County Jail and will be transferred to the Solano County Jail later this week, authorities said. In California, grand theft can be classified either as a misdemeanor or a felony, which determines whether a defendant can be sentenced to up to one year in county jail or up to three years in state prison; it wasnt clear which type of charge Saosongyang would face.
Meanwhile, Polen, the police spokesman, said lottery officials were discussing the winnings with the victim. He said he couldnt be certain that the man would receive payment.
Although, Im sure everything will work out in the end, he concluded in an email to The Washington Post, adding a smiley face.

"A former top Hillary Clinton aide took aim at 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Friday, after Sanders said he wasn’t really interested in receiving any advice from his 2016 Democratic presidential primary rival, citing “fundamental differences” with her.
“I don’t know who our nominee is going to be but I am damn sure that beating Trump &amp; getting America back on the right footing is going to require a unified Democratic Party, so crap like this 613 days before Election Day is irresponsible, counter-productive, &amp; sets us all back,” former Clinton senior adviser Nick Merrill tweeted Friday.
EX-SANDERS SPOKESMAN CALLS HILLARY CLINTON TEAM CHOICE WORDS IN INTERVIEW
Merrill’s blast came after Sanders, in an appearance on ABC's “The View,” told host Meghan McCain that he didn’t think he would be meeting with Clinton for advice about his presidential bid.
“I suspect not,” Sanders said. “She has not called me.”
Sanders then explained that while he respects Clinton, they don’t exactly agree on a variety of issues.
“We have differences, you know, Hillary has played a very important role in modern American politics,” he said.
McCain reiterated, “So you’re not interested in any advice from her?”
“I think not,” Sanders said, prompting laughter from the audience as he stumbled to finish his thought. He went on to say that the two have ""fundamental differences.""
BERNIE SANDERS TELLS 'THE VIEW' HE DOESN'T NEED ADVICE FROM HILLARY CLINTON: 'WE HAVE DIFFERENCES'
Merrill said that Sanders had touted his ties to the former secretary of state when it suited him, and posted a letter from Clinton from 2016 where she thanked Sanders for campaigning for her in the final days of the 2016 campaign.
The war of words is the latest sign of lingering bad blood between the two camps. The two faced off in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, with Sanders running a resilient challenge to the eventual nominee. Signs of trouble emerged this week when members of Clinton’s campaign criticized Sanders’ use of private jets in the last months of the campaign to Politico.
“I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the 2016 Clinton campaign, told Politico.
FIVE THINGS BERNIE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT SOCIALISM
Clinton staffers said that Sanders’ use of jets became “a running joke in the office” and noted that the use was at odds with his radical views on climate change and income inequality.
Members of Sanders’ campaign pushed back on the claims, saying that the demands were in part due to the rigorous schedule put before them, making chartered flights necessary.
“The requests for a charter only came after the schedules were put in front of us. If a less rigorous schedule were put in front of us, we wouldn’t have needed a charter and that would have been fine for everyone involved, including Bernie,” Rania Batrice, Sanders’ deputy campaign manager told the outlet. “Bernie worked his a-- off on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the campaign.”

Michael Briggs, Sanders’ 2016 spokesman, went further and called Clinton's staff as ""total ingrates.”
“You can see why she’s one of the most disliked politicians in America,"" Briggs said, referring to Clinton. ""She’s not nice. Her people are not nice. [Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.”
Briggs added: “It doesn’t make me feel good to feel this way but they’re some of the biggest a--holes in American politics.""

"A massive emergency aid bill for victims of hurricanes, wildfires, flooding and other natural disasters was defeated in the Senate on Monday amid a fight between Democrats and President Trump over relief for Puerto Rico.
Senate Democrats opposed the $13.45 billion legislation, contending the $600 million included for Puerto Ricos food stamp program is inadequate to meet the U.S. territorys needs as it attempts to recover from Hurricane Maria. The Democrats are embracing a House-passed relief bill containing hundreds of millions of dollars more for Puerto Rico than the GOP version the Senate is voting on Monday.
But Trump opposes sending any additional aid to Puerto Rico apart from the food stamp money, funding Republicans convinced him to accept as the price for passing the long-pending disaster bill.
The vote was 44 in favor and 49 against; 60 votes would have been needed for the legislation to advance.
Its unclear how Congress and the administration will move forward to revive it, an impasse that risks indefinitely delaying disaster funding nationwide amid partisan sniping.
Ahead of the vote, Republicans accused Democrats of holding up much-needed aid for everything from flooding in the midwest and tornadoes in the south to volcanic eruptions in Hawaii, so they could use Puerto Rico as a political issue against the president.
This is no time for our colleagues across the aisle to prioritize a political fight with the president ahead of the urgent needs of communities across our country, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor Monday. This does not need to be a difficult partisan decision.
Trump weighed in on Twitter earlier Monday in support of the legislation, which was authored in part by Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), one of his closest allies in the Senate.
Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdues disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America! Trump wrote.
But Democrats are furious over Trumps reluctance to send assistance to Puerto Rico, a stance the president has articulated in private meetings with aides and repeated last week in a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans.
Trump contended in his meeting with Senate Republicans that Puerto Rico has already gotten more disaster relief than many U.S. states. He cited a figure of $91 billion in aid, though that sum reflects an estimate of how much funding the island could receive over time and is more than twice as much as federal agencies have actually obligated or approved thus far.
Republicans must remember that just as we leave no soldier behind on the battlefield we help our fellow Americans when theres a disaster, wherever the disaster strikes. We do not abandon them. Period, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Daily News over the weekend. The president and Senate Republicans actions on Puerto Rico can be described in only two words: cruel and nasty.
Trump claimed last week that hes taken better care of Puerto Rico than any human being living. Puerto Ricos governor, Ricardo Roselló, a Democrat, recently described Trump as a bully and threatened during an interview on CNN to punch him in the mouth.
Roselló has publicly called on Congress to approve House Democrats version of the bill although without specifically opposing the Senate GOP version.
House Democrats bill does not include funding for the historic flooding that swept through Iowa, Nebraska and other midwestern states in mid-March, as the measure was completed and passed in January. That gap has allowed Republicans to argue that their bill, which would make billions of dollars available to the midwest, is the only piece of legislation that addresses the nations disaster needs in their totality.
Democrats, however, say they would support adding midwest flood aid to the House bill. As a number of Senate Democrats visit Iowa campaigning for president, some Republicans have argued that opposing major disaster aid for the state could be politically risky.
The congressional impasse has already led to cuts of about 25 percent to the food stamp benefits received in March by the 1.3 million Puerto Rico residents 43 percent of the islands population who rely on the program. If Congress does not pass the funding soon, those people will again be forced to survive on the reduced food stamp allocation.
The islands government has also had to cut the size of a supplemental cash benefit to the food stamp program that many elderly Puerto Ricans say they use to buy basic necessities, such as detergent and toothpaste.
Although Roselló says the food stamp money is criticial for Puerto Rico, he says other federal assistance is also necessary, such as money for reconstruction projects and debris removal, and other measures that were included in House Democrats legislation.",Massive disaster relief bill stalls in Senate over Puerto Rico dispute The Washington Post GOP disaster relief bill fails to advance in Senate NBC News McConnell shuts down the Pelosi agenda POLITICO Congress should give felons the right to vote in federal el…,2019-04-01T22:18:35Z,Massive disaster relief bill stalls in Senate over Puerto Rico dispute - The Washington Post,The Washington Post,0
"Last Monday evening, eight U.S. congressmen and I stood on a bluff overlooking the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona, at the southern border with Mexico. We were wrapping up a two-day tour of the border by getting a bird's-eye view of the thousands of cars and tractor-trailers carrying freight that enter America every day through this busy port.
It was a chance to see multiple elements of an effective border security plan – walls, roads and infrastructure, cameras and sensors -- and most importantly, highly trained and professional Border Patrol agents.
While we stood there, the cameras and sensors detected a man pushing concertina wire away from the slatted fence, so he could climb the barrier and slide down on the American side. He then raced into the brush at the bottom of the bluff on which we were standing. Shortly after, he hid. Two Border Patrol trucks raced up and agents rushed out. They found his hiding place and took him into custody.
REP. ANDY BIGGS: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ONLY ONE OPTION LEFT -- DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AT THE BORDER
In this case, a single illegal immigrant was apprehended because all the elements of border security were present. But what about the thousands of acres and miles where there is no wall to slow illegal crossings? What about the ravines and valleys that do not have camera or sensor coverage? And, most importantly, even if there is technology assisting in detection and surveillance, how do we capture illegal immigrants when our Border Patrol doesn’t have roads to drive on, radios for communication, and must patrol thousands of square miles with only a handful of agents?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  insists that building a border wall is “immoral.” I wonder when she last visited the border, spoke with agents, or conversed with families who live and work along it. Has she seen and heard the stories of the victims of the criminal violence that comes across the border, or counted the tens of thousands of people who have been harmed by the scourge of illegal drug and human trafficking?
Tons of drugs have been seized at ports of entry and even between the ports, and no one knows how many more tons are not interdicted. Approximately 40 percent of the drugs seized on our borders come through the Tucson sector. Again, that’s just what we catch.
We don’t know what we don’t know. That’s what’s important in this debate. What we know is devastating enough.
Death and addiction costs related to illegal drugs are backbreaking to this country. We have victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The frontier is rugged and exacts a physical toll, resulting in the deaths of many trying to enter the country illegally. Drug and human smugglers commit crimes against their human cargo with impunity, creating a humanitarian crisis. Environmentalists should be concerned by the ecological damage being inflicted by border crossers. Economic damage includes suppression of wages and technological innovation resulting from cheap labor.
We simply do not know the full extent of all of the problems caused and exacerbated by illegal immigrants, regardless of whether their motive to enter is malevolent or benign.
What we can be certain of is that as long as there are incentives to enter and stay illegally in this country, people will continue to flood our borders.

When my congressional colleagues and I stood on the bluff overlooking the Mariposa Port of Entry, and witnessed the apprehension of the illegal immigrant, we saw what a fully funded and functioning border security strategy might look like. The foundational element is to slow down illegal entrants. You do that by building a wall.
As Mary Ann Mendoza, an Angel mother whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant, said, “A wall won’t stop everyone, but no wall won’t stop anyone.”

"Some journalists are already touting Michael Cohen as the next John Dean, casting his upcoming congressional testimony as nothing short of historic.
But they are probably jacking up expectations too high.
While President Trump’s former personal lawyer turning on him before a House committee will be a television spectacle, Cohen’s allies say he will testify under great constraints.
The larger story, they say, is how this man who tied himself so closely to Trump has been utterly devastated—and is, in a sense, seeking redemption.
Cohen is flat broke. His wife and family are under enormous emotional strain. He is getting surgery a week before his testimony for a bone spur in his shoulder that has left him unable to lift his arm. The family is living in a hotel room with insurance payments following a flood at their home.
And a month after his Feb. 7 Hill appearance, Cohen reports to prison for three years.
MICHAEL COHEN TO TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE
In short, these sources say, Cohen will offer compelling testimony, but those who expect him to be able to fire a silver bullet that would bring down the president are going to be sorely disappointed. Cohen may have important new information that he has disclosed to Robert Mueller in 70 hours of interviews with prosecutors, but if so, he won’t be able to reveal it.
The major limitation, as Cohen has said, is that he can’t discuss anything still under investigation by the special counsel. That means Cohen, who is still hoping for a reduction in his sentence, can’t answer questions about Russian collusion or the proposed real estate project in Moscow. It also means he can’t address the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and a Russian lawyer (who was recently indicted on money-laundering charges).
“I expect Michael’s testimony will be personal, not partisan, and compelling,” Lanny Davis, again acting as Cohen’s attorney, told me. “He will describe what he did for Mr. Trump for 10 years that he now looks back on, as stated in court, with shame and regret. And he will explain what caused him, on July 2, 2018, to turn and put his family and country first; recognizing the dangers to the country in Mr. Trump’s misconduct and reckless behavior.”
In the interview, Davis implied a further reason for Cohen’s desire to testify.
Given the fraud and lying charges in the two Cohen guilty pleas, Davis said he “and many others believe the length of incarceration time, compared to others who committed far worse offenses, is disproportionately excessive and unjust. I hope someone in the Justice Department focuses on the word ‘justice’ when assessing the fairness of Michael’s three-year prison term. What they need to ask themselves is, would he have received this time if he had been someone who didn’t work for Donald Trump?”
The contours of the testimony are likely to frustrate Republican members of the oversight committee, now chaired by Democrat Elijah Cummings. Some may ask why Cohen is there if he is unable to answer questions on such vital topics.
What’s more, they will point out that Cohen is an acknowledged liar and ask why he should still be viewed as credible.
The New York lawyer wants to explain why he went to work for Trump, why he is ashamed of having worked for Trump, and how he made the decision last July to turn on his longtime benefactor, who has called him a “weak person” and a “rat.”
Part of that explanation will focus on Cohen’s view that while certain behavior might be tolerable in a private businessman, the standards are very different when that person becomes president.
Cohen will offer personal anecdotes about his service to Trump and what he has termed his complicity in “dirty deeds,” the sources say. These would likely be unflattering blasts from the past but could have little to do with his record as president.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The one area in which Cohen may shed some light, since it’s part of the public record, is on the hush money payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen has already said he was doing Trump’s bidding in both cases—the lawyer paid Daniels $130,000 and was reimbursed by the boss—but could fill in key details under questioning.
Dean, who was Richard Nixon’s White House counsel, broke open the Watergate coverup with his Senate testimony and wound up spending four months in jail. But he knew that conspiracy from the inside because he was a willing participant before turning against Nixon.
Cohen, having never gotten the White House job he wanted, is not in a similar position, no matter how much media hype surrounds his testimony. But like John Dean, he appears to view the appearance as a final chance to vindicate his reputation before heading off to prison.
“My heart goes out to Michael and his family,” Davis told me. “They are under great duress and strain.”","Michael Cohen, seeking vindication, can’t use most ammunition against Trump Fox News Michael Cohen's big day may not be about Russia CNN Democrats' investigations get rolling: Mnuchin, Cohen are first with much more to come Salon Michael Cohen should testify …",2019-01-12T11:40:24Z,"Michael Cohen, seeking vindication, can’t use most ammunition against Trump - Fox News",Fox News,0
"A Kentucky measure aimed at tackling “doxxing” – the intentional sharing of someone’s private information on the internet – passed a state Senate committee on Wednesday, with the father of a Covington Catholic High School student offering emotional testimony.
Ted Sandmann, father of Nick Sandmann, appeared before the Senate State and Local Government Committee to speak out about how his teen son became the epicenter of a Jan. 18 controversy involving his son, some of his schoolmates and some protesters near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
COVINGTON HIGH STUDENT'S LEGAL TEAM SLAMS WASHINGTON POST EDITOR’S NOTE, SAYS PAPER ‘DOUBLE DOWNED ON ITS LIES’
“My son, Nicholas Sandmann, was the victim of the most sensational Twitter attack in the history of the internet,” the elder Sandmann said, according to a report by the Courier Journal of Louisville.
My son, Nicholas Sandmann, was the victim of the most sensational Twitter attack in the history of the internet. 
 Ted Sandmann, father of Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann
Nick Sandmann and the Covington students were initially accused of causing a confrontation with an elderly Native American man and taunting him with chants, after a video of the event went viral. But subsequent videos and the students' own statements revealed that they were actually verbally accosted by a group of black street preachers who were shouting racially charged, homophobic insults at them a Native American group.
The father said that “selectively edited” videos of his son’s encounter were shared on Twitter, and drew abusive comments, such as “Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid?”
The latter comment -- which remained online early Thursday – was shared by left-wing author and producer Reza Aslan with his nearly 300,000 followers.
Ted Sandmann added that due to the incident, his son had to endure online abuse, threats and ridicule.
“It shows how far out-of-control social media has become,” he said.

The bill to crack down on doxxing, sponsored by state Republican Sen. Wil Schroder, easily passed the committee, though some lawmakers expressed concern about whether the proposal would overcome free-speech hurdles.
WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHES EDITOR’S NOTE ON COVINGTON CONTROVERSY COVERAGE
The measure, according to the Courier Journal, would provide more recourse against people who spread personal information and make threats on the internet.
It would also make a make it illegal to publish personal information online about a minor that could be used to identify someone with the purpose of causing harm, abuse, or making threats.
Under the law, individuals breaking the law would face a misdemeanor charge that could be elevated to a felony if physical harm or financial loss resulted from the actions.
Sandmann said during the hearing that the incident turned the family’s life upside down and affected his innocent son.
“We are still a far way from winning back my son’s reputation,” he said.
Since the Covington controversy, the legal team representing the Sandmann family has sued the Washington Post for $250 million in compensatory and punitive damages for the paper’s coverage of the incident.
Last week, the newspaper published an editor’s note admitting that subsequent information either contradicted or failed to confirm accounts relayed in its initial article.
The editor’s note was slammed by Sandmann’s legal team, which accused the paper of trying to  “whitewash” the encounter. They claimed the Post action was “too little and too late.”
“The Washington Post rushed to claim leadership of a mainstream and social media mob of bullies who falsely attacked, vilified and threatened Nicholas Sandmann, an innocent 16-year-old boy,” a statement posted on the law firm’s website said.

Then there was the candidates famously twitchy Twitter finger, scathing toward so many public figures but oddly respectful of the Russian president. Was that a signal of dark secrets, or just of a soft spot for a strongman?
And so, in 2016, began the F.B.I.s epic investigation and the attempt by journalists to track it.
There are a thousand ways for reporters to inquire into the slow unfolding of a scandal, many of them producing mostly frustration. Making call after call to lawyers for those under investigation and to their friends and frenemies, rivals and business associates. Scrutinizing a so-called dossier that makes shocking claims but offers little evidence sufficiently detailed to allow a true fact-check. Haunting congressional hearings and trailing the witnesses through the hallway mob scene afterward.
But if some F.B.I. inquiries are helpfully leaky for journalists, the special counsels investigation has proved hermetically sealed. Even so basic a question of when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, may deliver his report to the attorney general remains uncertain, the subject of many erroneous predictions.
If an investigation is a jigsaw puzzle, the mosaic of the two-year inquiry by Mr. Mueller remains incomplete, at least for the public and the press. We have seen major parts laid out in staggering detail in the 199 charges he has filed against 34 people and three companies the only way Mr. Mueller, 74, a former F.B.I. director, has so far chosen to speak.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, recommended Mr. Comeys firing.
President Trump fired Mr. Comey
The special counsel was appointed.
We know what keywords a particular Russian military intelligence hacker searched for on the web on a particular date. We know that Putins niece, introduced to a Trump campaign adviser by a suspicious professor, was not Putins niece. We know that a Trump Tower in Moscow, a longtime business dream of Mr. Trump, was still being secretly pursued even as the candidate took public stands that might please or offend Russia.
In that sense, the trickle has long since become a flood. The cast of characters has grown, and grown familiar Flynn, Manafort, Cohen, Papadopoulos; the pattern of lying to investigators and Congress has become routine; the presidents shifting stories have become the norm. News coverage has become background noise, like a sea that periodically surges and retreats.
But for all of that, much of the investigation remains guesswork. We dont know whether we know 90 percent or 50 percent or 20 percent of the findings. It is possible that Mr. Muellers team of aggressive prosecutors has already revealed virtually all of its work in public indictments and courtroom pronouncements. And it is also possible that the lawyers are hoarding shocking new information, disclosures capable of shaking the Trump presidency. We just dont know.
Mr. Sessions
Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general.
William P. Barr, the attorney general.
In a polarized country, with different news outlets offering divergent partisan spins, different factions fill the Mueller vacuum with radically different realities. Many Democrats, persuaded that the president has criminally obstructed justice, await final proof of collusion with Russia, the vague standard that has become a measure for Mr. Muellers ultimate findings.
Yet many of Mr. Trumps supporters, drawing their information from other sources, believe the real story is something else entirely: enemies of Mr. Trump misused government agencies to spy on his campaign, then began a bogus investigation to undermine his presidency.
It is an alarming divide, not because the two sides harbor different opinions, but because they believe different sets of facts.
So the capital is on edge, snatching at the latest rumors about when the Mueller report might appear and what it might say. The sphinxlike special counsel keeps his counsel. The journalists troll for fresh scraps of inside information, and hope the end is coming soon.",Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller Investigation New York Times Mueller has Washington on the edge CNN Special Counsel Investigations In History: From Nixon To Clinton To Trump NPR Some Advice to Robert Mueller on How to Finish That Big Writing Assig…,2019-03-22T03:00:06Z,Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller Investigation - New York Times,The New York Times,0

At least five people died this week in storms that battered different parts of California with heavy rain, wind and snow.
The Midwest and Northeast, meanwhile, are preparing for two storms, including one expected to dump several inches of snow in certain areas and could lead to a flash freeze.
Four people, including a family of three, were killed in two separate car accidents in Northern California because of slick roads, the California Highway Patrol said Thursday.
A 42-year-old homeless man was killed when a large tree fell on a camp he had set up near an Oakland freeway, authorities said. In Los Angeles County, a 57-year-old hiker was in critical condition after being struck by a large boulder that tumbled down a hillside in Malibu, the county sheriffs department said.

Evacuation orders were issued for parts of Southern California that had been ravaged by recent wildfires and were at risk of flash floods. Schools in Malibu were closed as a precaution and more than 140 flights were canceled at San Francisco International Airport.
Evacuation orders in the burn zone of the Woolsey Fire, which charred more than 96,000 acres late last year and destroyed some 1,500 structures, were lifted later Thursday, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.
By Thursday afternoon, the Getty Center in Los Angeles received over 6 inches of rain from a series of three storms that hit the region this week, and an area in the Ventura County mountains got more than 10 inches over the same period, according to the National Weather Service.

Twenty-one homes in the Hollywood Hills were evacuated Thursday morning because of the threat of mudslides and debris flows, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Deputy Chief Armando Hogan said soil geologists were called in as a precaution because ""these events are unpredictable."" Residents were allowed to return home later.
Flooding was also a risk in parts of Northern California that were devastated by the deadly Camp Fire late last year.
""Flash flooding is a dangerous and life-threatening situation,"" the Butte County Sheriff's Department said. ""Due to the dynamic nature of debris flow and flash flood events, residents should not wait for an evacuation order to take action."" The sheriff's office said search-and-rescue teams were dispatched three times Thursday for disabled cars on flooded roads.
In other parts of the country, a storm battered Illinois, western Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana on Thursday with rain and light snow. It could bring light snow to Washington, D.C., Thursday evening, weather analysts said.
This small and quick-moving storm, meteorologists said, will most likely leave up to three inches of snow in New England and the interior parts of the Northeast, with other areas seeing just an inch.

On the heels of that storm is a second one that forecasters predict could dump three to six inches of snow in the central Plains and Midwest, and up to four inches in New York.
In the Midwest, Des Moines, Chicago and Omaha will begin to see heavy snowfall Friday evening and into Saturday, according to forecasters, who also warned of potential blizzard conditions for parts of Illinois, Ohio and Indiana.
Further south, Wichita, Kansas City and some other Midwestern cities will get slammed with a mix that could include sleet, snow and freezing rain. Icy conditions could impact travel, meteorologists said.
This second storm will also strike Eastern Seaboard cities such as New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., Forecasters said light snow will begin in the Northeast on Saturday night before turning into a mix of snow and freezing rain. This is expected to continue through Sunday.

In addition to snow, this storm is expected to cause icy conditions. Forecasters said they are eyeing a possible ice storm in New York when temperatures drop from 40 degrees on Sunday to the single digits by Monday morning.
This rapid change in temperature paired with what's left on the ground from snowfall could lead to what meteorologists are calling a flash freeze"" hitting much of the Northeast and causing dangerous travel conditions.

"NEW YORK After El Chapo's conviction in a drug-trafficking trial that included florid testimony of jewel-encrusted guns, a fleet of cash-laden jets and a personal zoo with roaming big cats, some Americans have floated an idea they see as poetic justice: Why not take some of the Mexican drug lord's billions in ill-gotten gains and make him pay for a border wall?
That may be a tall order, especially since federal officials can't say for sure how much Joaquin Guzman may still have from his decades of smuggling drugs into the U.S., or how exactly they intend to get their hands on it.
For now, the U.S. Department of Justice says it will be seeking forfeiture of a fortune that Guzman's indictment valued at $14 billion. Authorities won't say how they came up with that figure, but experts say it is likely based on evidence of the value of the proceeds of massive drug shipments and whatever assets were used as part of the trafficking enterprise.
With Guzman, who faces life in prison for smuggling tons of heroin, meth, fentanyl and marijuana into the U.S., authorities know their forfeiture estimate is partly symbolic, to send a message to other traffickers that a conviction could cost them their fortune as well as their freedom, said Duncan Levin, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in forfeiture.
""It's obvious he doesn't have $14 billion,"" Levin said. ""And whatever he has may be largely uncollectable.""
That reality hasn't stopped conservatives from injecting border-wall politics into the El Chapo case. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas promises to reintroduce a bill named after El Chapo that would require money seized from Mexican cartels be dedicated to a border security.
Cruz said in an interview on Fox News that he got the idea for the bill more than a year ago as Congress was debating the cost of President Donald Trump's proposed border wall, then estimated at around $14 billion.
""There's a natural and elegant symmetry that suggested itself,"" Cruz said. ""Those billions that El Chapo has were made trafficking illegally across the U.S. border, bringing narcotics across the border, and it is only right that those ill-gotten gains go to fixing the problem of stopping the next narco-trafficker.""
Getting at those gains is another matter.
In domestic white-collar cases, there's usually a paper trail that points to seizable assets in hidden bank accounts and shell companies. But El Chapo's trial was rife with evidence about how his Sinaloa cartel went to great lengths to hide its profits, whether stashing cash in safehouses or by laundering it through a phony fruit juice business in Mexico City. And then there were the hours of testimony about how much public officials in Mexico were on the take, not to mention the complications of clawing back assets in another country.
Still, there were some tantalizing details of opulence from the trial. Jurors heard one cooperating witness, Miguel Angel Martinez, describe how during the 1990s ""cocaine boom"" Guzman had ""houses at every single beach"" and ranches ""in every single state."" He said Guzman would send his three private jets each month to pick up drug money in Tijuana. On average, each plane would carry up to $10 million to Sinaloa.
But the defense claimed the government's narrative of a flood of cash fueling Guzman's conspicuous consumption was wildly exaggerated. In his closing argument, defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman cited testimony from another cooperator who said that when Guzman was on the run as one of Mexico's most wanted about 10 years ago, he was $20 million in debt and could barely pay the underlings protecting him in one of his mountainside hideouts.
""The dude had no money,"" Lichtman told the jury.
Lichtman insisted in a phone interview Thursday that the idea that the 61-year-old Guzman is a billionaire is bogus.
The $14 billon ""is a fantasy figure,"" he said. ""It's fantasy not only on how it was reached, but on how they hope to collect on it.""
The final forfeiture must be set by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan.
Clues for how that might play out can be found in the case of Alfredo Beltrán-Leyva, another powerful Mexican kingpin - who pleaded guilty to U.S. drug charges and is serving a life term. The government asked a judge for a $10 billion forfeiture order it said was based on debriefings of top lieutenants in the Beltran-Leyva cartel who detailed his assets.
Eduardo Balarezo, who represented Beltran-Leyva, got that total knocked down to the $529 million after arguing that the $10 billion figure was ""pulled from thin air"" and impossible to enforce.
The lawyer sought to make that a similar point at the Guzman trial in his cross-examination of a former cartel member who testified against Guzman. The topic was his own $1 billion forfeiture order.
""The bottom line is you're never going to pay anything remotely resembling that number, right?"" the lawyer asked.
The witness responded: ""An amount like that, no.""",Make El Chapo pay for a border wall?

"Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Ed Rendell has criticized his own party’s move to block Fox News Channel from televising any of its debates in 2020.
Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, slammed the decision during an interview on Fox News’ ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Thursday night.
“I think it’s a mistake for the DNC to do what they did. If I was DNC chair – and I think Tom Perez is doing a good job – but if I was DNC chair, Laura, I would say, ‘give me Bret Baier, Chris Wallace, and Juan Williams and you can have that debate anywhere, anytime, any number of times.'
DNC BARS FOX NEWS FROM HOSTING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATES; NETWORK URGES PARTY TO RECONSIDER
“I’d be confident it would be fair,"" the onetime Philadelphia mayor added. ""If we could pick the commentators and the moderators, I think we should have the debate on Fox. Because let me tell you, even if you persuade three percent of Fox viewers, three percent last time out carries Michigan.”
Ingraham then showed a clip of Perez during a CNN interview saying he “wants to make sure the debates are focused on the issues,” before airing highlights of Wallace and Baier grilling President Trump during a Republican primary debate and presidential debate in 2016.
“Those are all examples, of course, of Fox News anchors being more than tough and probably fair with President Trump, candidate Trump,” Ingraham said.
The interview came just hours after Fox News urged the party to reconsider the decision.
MEDIA BUZZ: WHY DNC BLEW IT IN BARRING A FOX DEBATE AFTER NEW YORKER PIECE
“We hope the DNC will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism, from moderating a Democratic presidential debate. They’re the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America, which includes many persuadable voters,” Fox News Senior Vice President Bill Sammon said in a statement.
Earlier in the day, Perez announced the party would not allow Fox News to host primary debates, claiming they would not be “fair and neutral” forums for the candidates.
“I believe that a key pathway to victory is to continue to expand our electorate and reach all voters,” Perez said in a statement to The Washington Post that cited a critical article in The New Yorker. “That is why I have made it a priority to talk to a broad array of potential media partners, including Fox News. Recent reporting in the New Yorker on the inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration and Fox News has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates. Therefore, Fox News will not serve as a media partner for the 2020 Democratic primary debates.”
While some Fox News Channel opinion hosts have come under fire for their coverage of the Trump administration, Wallace, Baier and MacCallum are anchors from the news division who have been praised for their handling of past debates. In 2016, Wallace moderated a presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Reacting to the DNC’s decision, Baier tweeted Wednesday, “That’s really a shame. When it comes to fairness - our news product speaks for itself. We will continue to cover this 2020 race fairly &amp; will continue to invite Democrats- Republicans &amp; Independents on to talk about key issues &amp; substance with our very large viewing audience.”
The DNC announced last month that NBC News will host the first Democratic primary debate of the 2020 election cycle in June. Back in 2016, the Republican National Committee famously pulled out of a planned NBC News Republican primary debate after a similar event on CNBC was criticized for allegedly unfair questions.

"CLEVELAND President Trump made his final pitch to voters Monday by traveling to a trio of Midwestern states that propelled him to the White House, digging deep into the tactics that he used two years ago in hopes of unseating Democrats and holding the GOP majority in the Senate. In his last day of campaigning before polls open Tuesday, Trump revived his war against the media by accusing CNN without evidence of broadcasting Fake Suppression Polls and floating unfounded claims of illegal voting as he also did in 2016, insisting without proof that a lot of people planned to vote illegally. The first of three rallies on Monday here in Ohios largest city also continued the apocalyptic, fact-deprived theme that Trump has hammered on recent days. The president started his 56-minute speech by touting the economy, but quickly pivoted to fearmongering rhetoric centered on crime and immigration. Trump accused Democrats of taking a wrecking ball to our economy and to our future, while claiming without evidence that Democrats are trying to attract more undocumented immigrants into the country so they can vote in elections. Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to flood into our country and overwhelm your communities, Trump claimed, later adding: If you want more caravans and more crime, vote Democrat. If you want strong borders and safe communities, vote Republican. He also falsely told the throng of supporters that were building the wall, dont worry, while arguing that barbed wire looks like its going to be very effective, too, referring to his deployment of thousands of troops to the southern border. Of Richard Cordray, the Democratic nominee for governor here, Trump claimed that the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was crushing people, crushing community banks, destroying small business, destroying jobs while mocking Cordrays close ally, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Trumps itinerary Monday included this swing state, where Republicans have struggled to gain traction against incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) in the Senate race, and two red states, Missouri and Indiana a sign of how his popularity has been limited to conservative areas. The campaign stops in his six-day, 11-rally blitz also show that Trump seems to have largely conceded the battle for the House to Democrats and instead is relying on his personal appeal to the base of the party to push GOP Senate candidates across the finish line. He took an explicitly personal tone in a conference call with more than 200,000 supporters and then later at the rally in Cleveland, telling his backers that he was effectively up for election as a way to implore his base to turn out and vote on Tuesday. In a certain way, I am on the ballot, Trump said in the call organized by his reelection campaign. Whether we consider it or not, the press is very much considering it a referendum on me and us as a movement. Before leaving Washington for Mondays spate of rallies, Trump also announced in a tweet that Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesdays Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Shortly before Trumps tweets, the Department of Justice had announced it would deploy personnel to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states to monitor compliance with voting rights laws a move that prompted suspicion and some alarm from voting rights advocates. Trump, whose own voter fraud commission was abandoned with little to show for it, did not provide any proof of voting irregularities. Just take a look. All you have to do is go around, take a look at what's happened over the years, and you'll see, Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in Washington. There are a lot of people, a lot of people my opinion, and based on proof that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally. So we just want to let them know that there will be prosecutions at the highest level. Trump also defended an immigration-themed ad from his campaign after Facebook and several television networks including his own favorite, Fox News decided not to run it because it was deemed racist. We have a lot of ads. And they certainly are effective, based on the numbers that we're seeing, Trump said. When told many found the ad offensive, Trump retorted: Well, a lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times. He also signaled that his Cabinet could be poised for a shake-up come Wednesday, noting that administrations make changes, usually after midterms, and probably well be right in that category, too. Later in Ohio, Trump told the crowd that he would never call a woman beautiful again because it is now politically incorrect an apparent dig at the #MeToo movement shortly before he introduced his daughter, senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump, to the stage. Youre not allowed to use the word beautiful anymore when you talk about women. Its politically incorrect, Trump told the crowd in Cleveland. He then asked the men in the crowd to raise their hands and vow to never call women beautiful. Im not allowed to say it because because its my daughter Ivanka, but shes really smart and shes here, Trump continued. Should I bring her up?..Come on up, Ivanka. Wow, wow. Hi, Ohio, Ivanka Trump said. That was some introduction. After she left the microphone, her father said, I never said she was beautiful, but she was smart. Kim reported from Washington.

"President Trump on Wednesday said the White House was studying whether it should impose import penalties on all foreign automobiles in response to General Motors announcement that it was shuttering multiple U.S. plants. The comment, made in multiple Twitter posts, was the latest attempt by Trump to revive his threat to slap tariffs on billions of dollars in auto imports from Japan, South Korea, Germany and other countries. Trump has said in the past that those threats were meant as a way to extract concessions from other countries on unrelated trade matters. But by connecting the threat to GMs plans, he could put extreme pressure on other world leaders as they prepare to gather at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina later this week. Such a move would mark a huge escalation of the trade war Trump has already launched against multiple countries, forcing foreign leaders to decide quickly whether to retaliate or bend to Trumps economic demands. It could also have a profound and immediate impact on the U.S. economy, as it could drive up the cost of automobiles for a huge segment of car buyers, forcing Americans to rethink major purchases that in the past have helped the economy grow. Trump said tariffs on cars would be effective in reviving the U.S. auto industry because the United States has had a 25 percent tariff on light truck imports since 1964, which he says has helped shield the U.S. market from a flood of truck imports. This tariff is known as the chicken tax, because it was imposed in response to a fight between U.S. and European poultry producers over the price of chickens. If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here, Trump wrote on Twitter. And G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan &amp; Maryland. Get smart Congress. Also, the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades. The President has great power on this issue Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now! His point is that by driving up the cost of foreign-made automobiles, U.S. consumers would gravitate toward less costly American-made products. But it was unclear what precisely Trump was referring to when he told Congress to get smart or when he said The President has great power on this issue. Congress is not considering any measure that would penalize auto imports. In fact, a number of lawmakers have discussed curbing Trumps power to impose import penalties. The White House can impose tariffs on auto imports if the Commerce Department concludes that the current level of imports somehow poses a national security threat to the United States. Many Democrats and Republicans in Congress have said such a finding would be preposterous, but Trump has broad leeway to use these powers if he wishes. Foreign leaders have threatened to retaliate with tariffs against U.S. products if Trump follows through with automobile tariffs, but that hasnt deterred the White House. Trump believes that foreign countries dump low-cost items in the United States and make it difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete, a trend that he says has destroyed millions of jobs. His comments on Wednesday mark the third straight day that Trump has responded to GMs announcement with policy-related attacks. On Monday, he ordered GM executives to reverse their decision. On Tuesday, he threatened to take away any government subsidies. And on Wednesday, he threatened the new auto tariffs. The United States imported close to $200 billion of new foreign passenger vehicles and light trucks last year, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. The angry response to GMs decision is coming from multiple top Trump officials. The Twitter account of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin amplified a message from an anonymous account called The_Trump_Train on Wednesday that demanded GM pay back the $11.2 billion bailout that was funded by the American taxpayer. Mnuchin later deleted his endorsement of that statement and would not provide more information into what happened or who was involved. A retweet was posted last night on @stevenmnuchin1 by someone other than the Secretary or an individual with authorized access to his account. As such, the retweet is being deleted, Mnuchin wrote in a Twitter post from the same account that had originally retweeted The_Trump_Train. Much of the information in that original Twitter post was incorrect. GM did receive government bailout funds after the financial crisis, as did many other companies, but it repaid its U.S. loans $6.7 billion in 2010. The Treasury Department managed the government loan program, and Mnuchin has prided himself on an acute knowledge of all the agencys operations. There are many anonymous Twitter accounts that post inaccurate information in support of Trump, but The_Trump_Train made quite an impact within the White House on Wednesday. Four of its other posts were retweeted by President Trump himself on Wednesday. Those posts, unlike the one originally endorsed by Mnuchins account, were never deleted.",Washington Post Trump threatens penalties on foreign cars after GM plans US layoffs Washington Post President Trump on Wednesday said the White House was studying whether it should impose import penalties on all foreign automobiles in response to General Moto…,2018-11-28T16:29:55Z,Trump threatens penalties on foreign cars after GM plans US layoffs - Washington Post,The Washington Post,0
"(CNN)You might abandon those dreams of a white Christmas once you see what it could do to your holiday travel plans. 
A major storm Friday has brought a triple threat of heavy rain, high winds, snow and ice to the East Coast, and it's already causing headaches on one of the busiest travel days of the year. 
More than one-third of all Americans -- 112.5 million -- are expected to travel this holiday season, according to AAA's predictions. About 102 million people will be driving, while 46 million will be flying with US airlines, according to the trade group Airlines for America. 
The storm could make things harder for everyone. 
Here's what you can expect: 
More than 90 million people were under some type of flood warning, watch or advisory Friday from Florida to New England, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen, and the rain showed no signs of abating. 
It's expected to continue over much of the eastern part of the country, with the heaviest rain forecast for the Northeast, where folks could see between 1 and 3 inches. 
Washington, Philadelphia and New York City were all under a flood warning or watch Friday morning, Hennen said. And there were already reports of flash flooding in New York, where a warning remained in effect until late morning. 
All three New York-area airports were reporting delays between one and two hours, Hennen said, and they were expected to increase throughout the day Friday as more travelers showed up to catch their flights. 
More than 50 million people were under wind advisories or high wind warnings from Florida to Maine, where wind gusts reaching 50 mph could cause scattered power outages.
Nearly 50,000 people on the East Coast were without power Friday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, with the lion's share of outages reported in Florida. 
The winds and rains were causing delays for folks flying out of Philadelphia, Hennen said. And travelers in Boston, Washington, Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, could be affected as well. 
The wind could also cause trouble for travelers in Seattle, where a wind storm with gusts of up to 70 mph left tens of thousands of homes and businesses without power Thursday. 
Winter weather advisories were in effect throughout parts of New England, Hennen said, where freezing rain could cause icy roads, complicating travel plans for folks who wanted to avoid hectic airports. 
The southern Appalachian Mountains were also under advisories and could see anywhere from 2 to 8 inches of snow, according to Hennen. 
Low clouds, rain and snow could also hinder travelers in Chicago and the surrounding area as colder air moves in and drops snow Saturday across the Great Lakes region.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala. As a piano and violin music play in the background, a sonogram shows a fetus moving in a mother’s stomach as text appears, saying: “Be a voice for the voiceless, Vote YES on Amendment 2.” This was one of three digital ads produced by the Alabama Republican Party leading up to the midterm elections in support of a ballot measure proposed by state Rep. Matt Fridy. Amendment 2 recognizes the “the rights of unborn children” and clarifies that the state’s constitution “does not protect the right to an abortion or require funding of abortion.” Alabamians passed the amendment with 59 percent of the vote. By a slimmer margin, voters in West Virginia approved a similar ballot measure, removing abortion protections from the state’s constitution. Those who oppose abortion say the successful passage of these amendments could open the flood gates for the pro-life movement – and will have ripple effects in communities across the country that are considering dialing back abortion rights. “Hopefully, [these amendments] can be one of the ripples that starts the wave of seeing some pro-life legislation passed throughout the country,” Cole Wagner, executive director of Alliance for Pro-Life Alabama, told Fox News on the steps of the state’s Capitol. The addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the bench gives the Supreme Court five presumably conservative members – compared to the four more liberal justices. Analysts say this has motivated local governments to push more anti-abortion legislation, which could, if appealed, provide a challenge to Roe v. Wade. “With Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, the threat to Roe v. Wade is no longer a hypothetical,” read a statement by Alabama for Healthy Families, a group that opposed Alabama’s ballot measure. The Alabama for Healthy Families argued that the state’s measure was too restrictive and offered no exceptions for cases of rape, incest and when the woman’s life is in danger. “If Roe is overturned and with Amendment 2 in effect,” the statement said, “there will be life or death consequences for Alabamians.” Alabama’s amendment does not invoke any immediate change other than tweaking the state’s constitutional language. But Fridy said those small changes go a long way in “protecting the rights of the unborn.” “The purpose is to ensure that our constitution can never be used as a tool to provide for a right for an abortion,” Fridy continued. “And to have the state of Alabama go on record as one that defends life.” West Virginia, on the other hand, will see tangible changes as a result of its new amendment. The purple state will no longer be one of 17 states that allow public funds to cover almost all abortions for people on Medicaid, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Some believe the ballot approvals underscore a growing, local movement against abortion rights – and they say those sentiments could help sway the Supreme Court to eventually overturn the 1973 ruling. Heidi Sieck is the co-founder of #VoteProChoice, an organization encouraging Americans to elect abortion rights advocates. (#VoteProChoice) “It’s encouraging for the pro-life movement to see life win directly on the ballot – not just pro-life candidates winning in Senate races across the country,” said Mallory Quigley, a spokesperson for the Susan B. Anthony List, a non-profit with a mission to end abortion. Those in favor of abortion rights agree the anti-abortion movement is growing – particularly under President Trump. They called it a dangerous movement that will strip women of their basic rights and move the country backward by decades. “The threat is very real,” said Heidi Sieck, founder of #VoteProChoice, adding that the recent losses have been “substantial and terrifying.” But, she said, while ballot measure approvals and the Kavanagh appointment are emboldening anti-abortion activists, it is also reawakening the abortion rights movement. “Women’s lives are at stake,” Sieck said, “and people are stepping up to protect that right.” Sieck believes an overturn of Roe v. Wade is practically inevitable with Kavanaugh’s confirmation. She blamed his appointment for the increasing pressure from anti-abortion legislators. The opposing side, she said, has been passing “unconstitutional abortion bans” for decades, but now the controversial laws, if appealed, will “barrel towards this anti-choice Supreme Court.” Wagner of Pro-Life Alabama said he’s glad pro-abortion activists are becoming angry – that means his movement is making an impact. “If [abortion rights advocates] are getting riled up and if they’re getting galvanized in their own efforts,” he told Fox News, “that says to me we’re making progress on our side of the aisle – and that excites me more than anything.”","Fox News Abortion debate intensifies after amendments pass removing abortion protections in 2 states Fox News MONTGOMERY, Ala. – As a piano and violin music play in the background, a sonogram shows a fetus moving in a mother's stomach as text appears, saying:…",2018-11-17T01:24:12Z,Abortion debate intensifies after amendments pass removing abortion protections in 2 states - Fox News,Fox News,0
"Washington (CNN)Attorney General nominee Bill Barr cannot recall if he had any discussions with the White House about invoking executive privilege to block the release of any report by special counsel Robert Mueller, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Lawmakers questioned Barr at length during his confirmation hearing about the circumstances under which he'd release Mueller's report at the conclusion of his investigation, some balking at the idea of Barr instead releasing his own report based on Mueller's findings.
""I don't know what will be included any report prepared by the Special Counsel, what form such a report will take, or whether it will contain confidential or privileged material,"" Barr said in a written response to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee that were released Monday. ""If it turns out that any report contains material information that is privileged or confidential, I would not tolerate an effort to withhold such information for any improper purpose, such as to cover up wrongdoing.""
The 68-year-old nominee reiterated that the report Mueller submits to the Justice Department ""explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel"" is considered ""confidential,"" but the special counsel regulations do not ""restrict what Congress may do with the report.""
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal introduced a new bill Monday that would require the special counsel submit a report directly to Congress at the conclusion of an investigation that includes ""the factual findings of the investigation, including any underlying evidence.""
Barr has also come under scrutiny for an unsolicited June 2018 memo he wrote laying why Mueller's obstruction of justice theory would be ""fatally misconceived"" if predicated on President Donald Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey. 
In his written answers, Barr confirmed that he mentioned the memo as part of a conversation about ""issues that could arise during the confirmation process"" during his November 2018 meeting with the President and then-acting White House counsel Emmet Flood, but said Trump did not comment on the memo and there was no discussion of the substance of the investigation. 
Barr also revealed a meeting with Trump at the White House on December 5 of last year, the same day of President George H.W. Bush's funeral. The meeting, which has not been previously reported, was requested by Trump and was attended also by Flood and Vice President Mike Pence, but Mueller's work was not discussed Barr said.
Asked by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons if he has ever had contact or communications with anyone from the Russian government, Barr wrote that he maintained a relationship with a Soviet consular officer at the request of the FBI beginning in 1980.
""In approximately 1980, the federal judge for whom I clerked introduced me to someone I understood to be a consular officer from the Soviet Embassy, and I subsequently had several lunches with him at the request of the FBI. I debriefed the FBI following each meeting,"" Barr said, adding that the matter has been included in background investigation and he has not had any other contact with Russian officials, ""to the best of my recollection and knowledge."" 
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider Barr's nomination along with multiple judicial nominations on Tuesday, but the panel is expected to hold over its vote on Barr for one week, until February 5.","Attorney General nominee Bill Barr cannot recall if he had any discussions with the White House about invoking executive privilege to block the release of any report by special counsel Robert Mueller, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.",2019-01-28T20:27:35Z,Barr says he hasn't spoken to White House about executive privilege on Mueller report,CNN,0
"(CNN)An intense and sprawling winter storm is expected to develop starting Tuesday across the Great Plains, delivering hurricane-force wind gusts, severe rain, heavy snow and floods for days across a wide swath of the central United States. 
The storm is forecast to rapidly intensify overnight Tuesday east of the Colorado Rockies. It will then trek slowly northeast through Thursday, delivering a variety of extreme weather from New Mexico to the Midwest. 
Centered in Kansas as it hits its midweek peak, gusts as strong as 100 mph are possible as the storm toys with a state record low for sea level pressure, which is one indicator of storm strength. 
A white-out is expected in parts of the Northern Plains
Blizzard and winter storm warnings are in place Tuesday for portions of Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and South Dakota.
Heavy snow is expected in portions of the Rockies and Northern Plains, with a foot or more falling in many areas. 
Strong winds will bring white-out conditions through Wednesday evening to places including western Nebraska and northeast Colorado. Blowing snow will make travel treacherous or impossible during these times. 
Snow should taper off by midday Thursday, but strong winds will persist through the evening.
Hurricane-like gusts may whip the Southern Plains
Thunderstorms overnight Tuesday across portions of the Southern Plains will make way on Wednesday for sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph, akin to the strength of a low-end tropical storm. The National Weather Service has issued high wind watches for more than 8 million people.
Even stronger wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph are expected Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morningacross Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett said. Some areas could see gusts as strong as 100 mph, which is equivalent to the wind speed of a Category 2 hurricane.
Widespread power outages will be a significant concern.
Soaking rains and snowmelt could flood the Midwest
Parts of the Midwest on Wednesday are expected to see heavy rains, a big worry after recent record-setting snowfall.
Flood watches have been issued across the Midwest and Great Plains amid concerns that heavy rains will melt snowpack and trigger significant flooding. Flash flooding is possible if ice jams clog rivers and streams, the weather service notes.
Rain is predicted to begin turning to snow in these areas by Wednesday evening. 
More severe storms are due to hit the South
Further south, strong winds, large hail and a few tornadoes are possible overnight Tuesday from southeastern New Mexico to western Texas.
As the system pushes east, another round of early spring storms is due to take shape. The primary concern is damaging winds, and brief tornado activity is possible. 
Portions of Louisiana and Arkansas face a slight risk for severe weather Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center said. The risk shifts Thursday into Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama.","An intense and sprawling winter storm is expected to develop starting Tuesday across the Great Plains, delivering hurricane-force wind gusts, severe rain, heavy snow and floods for days across a wide swath of the central United States.",2019-03-12T17:29:48Z,"Winds near hurricane strength are set to whip the central US, with white-outs, floods and tornadoes possible, too",CNN,1
"(CNN)Parts of the Midwest braced forheavy flooding this weekend in the wake of the powerful ""bomb cyclone"" as well as from the natural snow melt during spring thaw, forecasters said.
Communities in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota expected to be hard-hit remain under a flood warning for rain and snow melt Friday.
""Flooding of small streams and poor drainage urban areas continued over far southeast South Dakota, northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa. Frozen ground and high water levels in main river systems was slowing the decrease in floodwaters in many locations,"" the National Weather Service said.
""Excessive runoff from previous rainfall (and) snow melt will cause flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other drainage areas and low lying spots.""
Southern Wisconsin towns also battled high waters and a flood warning in effect till Saturday morning. The region is experiencing road closings as a result of flooding caused by the snow melt, rainfall, frozen ground and ice jams, the weather service said.
In Fond du Lac, flooding was occurring on the Fond du Lac River due to an ice jam, forecasters said, while other areas affected included Lodi in Columbia County, Darlington in Lafayette County, Prairie du Sac in Sauk County and DeForest in Dane County.
'Bomb cyclone' heads north to Canada
The intense bomb cyclone that brought blizzard conditions to the region was moving into Canada on Friday.
Dangerous weather conditions were expected for millions who are under some sort of watch, warning or advisory as it heads east and then north.
A bomb cyclone occurs when there is a rapid pressure drop, with a decrease of at least 24 millibars -- a measure of atmospheric pressure -- over 24 hours. This storm dropped 33 millibars from Tuesday into Wednesday.
""Although the focus of the bomb cyclone was clearly on the blizzard side, the area east of the low picked up significantly heavy rains on top of existing snowpack and frozen ground that was unable to absorb any of the rain and water runoff,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.
The storm's heavy rainfall has caused major flooding and damaged roads and bridges in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri.
Flooding was widespread in areas along the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri rivers in Missouri, while Nebraska has also been hammered by high water. 
Nebraska Game and Parks Commission employees used a fan boat to rescue residents in Gretna. The Mead Fire Department was helping people near Horseshoe Lake. The Columbus Police Department warned residents to stay away from the Black Bridge. One person is believed to be missing in Boyd County when a dam collapsed and a house was washed downstream.

"In ancient times, Arab tribesmen dug diversion tunnels to protect their low-lying trading post of Petra against desert flash floods. More than two millennia later, an alarm system warns visitors if flood water rushes toward what has become Jordan's main tourist attraction. Earlier this month, the alarms were activated for the first time, said Hussein al-Hasanat of the Petra Development &amp; Tourism Region Authority. Sirens blared minutes before a torrent fed by heavy rains approached the UNESCO World Heritage site carved into rose-hued rock face. Hundreds of tourists were able to seek higher ground and were later evacuated, he said. Amateur video posted online at the time showed visitors running through a steep, narrow canyon leading to the Treasury, Petra's main draw, as guides urged them to hurry. Later, visitors were seen standing on a higher patch near the Treasury as knee-high water poured through the canyon. Elsewhere in Jordan, such alarms are still missing. Thirty-four people were killed in flash floods in late September and early November. The last fatal flash flood struck Petra in 1963 when 22 French tourists and a local guide were killed by rapidly rising waters. In response, Jordan's Department of Antiquities built a dam to keep water from entering the canyon leading to the Treasury. In 2014, the alarm system was installed as added protection, with sirens set to go off when flood water rises above four meters (yards). On Nov. 9, the system was triggered for the first time, through a computer in the Petra Authority's control room. The computer is connected to eight rain forecast systems and two water detection stations placed in the area, within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of Petra. The network generates instant data allowing officials to measure possible danger and warn people by the time the water reaches Petra. Omar Dajani, a meteorologist at the Arabia Weather company, said alarms should be installed in all vulnerable areas in Jordan. He said urban sprawl has exacerbated the flood risk, which is particularly high in dry areas. ""Now towns have spread so much and many of them were not built with respect for the geography of the region, such as valleys for example, where the water has naturally caused floods for millions of years,"" Dajani said.","Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

"It looked as though a couple police officers went dumpster diving for ornaments. Hanging from the Christmas tree inside a Minneapolis Police Department precinct were half-crushed cans of Steel Reserve malt liquor and crumpled bags of Takis chips and Funyuns. There was a cup from the fried-chicken joint Popeyes and two packs of Newport cigarettes pieces of actual garbage accented by a single strip of yellow crime-scene tape that didnt quite cut it as tinsel. If the police thought the scene was a joke, nobody was laughing. These pieces of trash were deliberately chosen to represent how certain officers feel about the community they serve: that black people are a stereotype to be mocked and the lives of those they serve may as well be reduced to trash in the gutter, said City Councilman Phillipe Cunningham, who represents constituents in the majority-black Near North neighborhood where the MPDs 4th Precinct is located. The two Minneapolis police officers who created the display were placed on leave Friday in response to fierce backlash from both the African American community and public officials, including Mayor Jacob Frey, who described the tree as racist, despicable, and well beneath the standards of any person who serves the city of Minneapolis. The tree, beyond being seen as a racist dog-whistle, as longtime civil rights activist Roy Edwards described it, also rekindled simmering distrust between police and the black community in Minneapolis. Three years ago, community organizers led an 18-day occupation outside the 4th Precinct station to protest the fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old black man. Since then, activists said at a news conference Friday, they had hoped police would be doing everything possible to improve their relationship with the Near North Minneapolis community, rather than seeming to go out of their way to strain it. I just could not believe that after everything weve been through to try to change the narrative about the African American community, that our police officers still held that same mind-set, Black Lives Matter Twin Cities activist Chauntyll Allen said at the news conference. They have no respect for the lives that have been lost. Cunningham and Minneapolis Board of Education member KerryJo Felder were among the first public officials to sound off about the tree after hearing complaints and seeing photos flood social media. Cunningham said Friday on Facebook that he learned from speaking with an MPD inspector that every year an officer is assigned tree-decorating duties. This year, Cunningham said, two officers decided to hang the inappropriate ornaments as a prank. They hurt EVERY gain made in improving community-police relations, Cunningham wrote on Facebook. On a personal level, despite being a [Council Member], I am still a Black man myself and these outrageous reminders only further my own feeling [of being] generally unsafe around police officers. At first, Frey was so incensed that he vowed the officers responsible would be fired by the end of the day. Termination, he wrote, is necessary both to discipline the officer and to send a clear message: [Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo] and I will not tolerate conduct that departs from our values. But within hours, Frey walked back the statement after realizing there is a legally required process that must be followed"" before an officer can be discharged, his spokesman, Mychal Vlatkovich, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Arradondo, describing the Christmas tree as a racially insensitive display, said in a statement that he was ashamed and appalled"" by the behavior of the two officers involved. He said a full investigation had been launched. Edwards, the civil rights activist who has lived in Minneapolis since the 1940s, told The Washington Post that what the community needs to see is a black officer in charge of the 4th Precinct. Racial insensitivity training, he said, will only do so much. And for those who questioned what was so racially insensitive about the bag of Takis and the fried-chicken fast-food cup, Edwards said those who lived in the neighborhood didnt need to ask. These policemen are well familiar with what racism is, he said. They knew exactly what they were doing when they decorated the tree.

"Homeowners in wildfire-prone areas of California and other Western states now have yet another worry: Insurers have issued an ominous warning that they could be facing a ""wildfire deductible"" in coming years or, even worse, the prospect of having their home insurance canceled altogether. The surprising notice came from Aon, the largest insurance broker in the U.S., where meteorologist Steve Bowen pointed out that fire losses have exceeded $10 billion for the second year running. In California, the Camp Fire alone has killed 86 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 20,000 homes. House fires of almost any kind have traditionally been covered under home insurance policies -- no questions asked. But ""risks that were once insurable … will become uninsurable,"" said Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice. ""Insurers have long excluded wind in coastal states and earthquake and flood everywhere from homeowners' policies."" Perils such as hurricanes, earthquakes and flooding are what insurers consider ""primary"" risks, which puts them in a category of being insurable only under special circumstances. Earthquakes generally require a separate policy or a separate endorsement. Flood insurance is handled by the federal government (although surplus carriers will insure above the federal minimum). But home fires have always been ""secondary"" risks. ""The standard assumption of wildfire being a 'secondary' peril may evolve in the future,"" Aon's Bowen said. He added that this ""may lead to a shift in mindset that causes industries [like insurers] to alter their view of fire risk."" How officials are identifying victims of California’s deadliest wildfire Consumer advocates such as Bob Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said the intent is clear. With wildfires now graduating to the highest level of peril for insurers, they're going to react accordingly -- by running away, raising rates whenever possible or inserting ""deductibles"" in their contracts so they pay out less and put more burden on policyholders. Worldwide, fires and explosions account for nearly a quarter of the value of all insurance claims, according to Allianz Global. Are insurers' current losses from conflagrations like the Camp Fire bad enough to cause serious economic losses for insurers? No, said Amy Bach, executive director of San Francisco-based United Policyholders. Property-casualty insurers now have a huge ""policyholders' surplus,"" the amount of money available to pay claims, of nearly $760 billion, the highest in history. But that doesn't mean they want to lose money in the future, especially as the wildfire danger from climate change, drought and unmanaged forests increases in states like California. If the current problems continue and grow, ""there will be a strain on both public and private insurance,"" predicted Birnbaum. Penalized for not clearing brush ""Insurers have been very aggressive in limiting coverage in the past, and I see what Aon is doing as trying to get out in front of this problem in the future,"" said Bach. Some insurers appear to be not waiting even for a month to go by before taking action. One letter from a Woodland Hills, California, insurance agency informed a homeowner earlier this year that his insurer was adding ""a 20 percent wildfire deductible"" to his policy based on a survey showing that he hadn't cleared brush 150 feet from his house. Fire-stricken areas of California face mudslide threats Allstate, the second-largest home insurer, sparked concern when it said on its website that some policies may exclude coverage for wildfire. ""Coverage may vary by geographic location and by policy,"" Allstate said. Farmers, also a major home insurer, issued an ""Amendatory Endorsement"" limiting liability for ""Wild Fire Smoke, Soot, Char, Ash, Odor Damage,"" particularly if it was ""not visible to the unaided human eye."" Will more restrictions appear in the future? Probably. Home insurers are likely to take several approaches to limiting coverage. Desirable -- but vulnerable -- areas Advocates for the industry are quick to point out that this won't affect all 40 million Californians, such as those who live in urban areas. But it will cost people who live in rural or ""wildlife-urban interface areas,"" where tree lines and brush meet development and tract homes in hilly areas. These are the very areas where many city-dwelling Californians want to escape to and live. One insurance solution is to simply abandon areas that have already seen a major fire, like the ill-named town of Paradise in Butte County and also in Ventura County, where the Woolsey fire destroyed 2,000 homes and killed three people at almost the same time as Paradise went up in flames. How wildfire smoke and poor air quality can affect your health By law, insurers are required to write one renewal after a declared disaster, according to Madison Voss, deputy press secretary for the California Department of Insurance. After that, however, ""the Department doesn't have the authority to require insurance companies to write … in a particular area,"" Voss said. That would throw hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Californians onto the state's FAIR plan, a ""last resort"" insurance vehicle for the otherwise uninsurable. An alternative, although not always a good one, is to get home insurance with a ""non-admitted carrier."" That's an insurer who isn't licensed in California but can still sell there. The downside: If the carrier goes bankrupt, homeowners can't get a bailout from the state, as they did when Merced Property &amp; Casualty recently became insolvent. Adding wildfire deductibles Given their huge resources, insurers seldom declare bankruptcy. Far more likely is that others will follow the lead of carriers who have already started to add wildfire deductibles. Wind deductibles are common in hurricane-prone areas such as New York and New Jersey, and since California fires are often wind-driven, that's a likely course of action for insurers there. They're also likely to insist that anyone in a fire-prone area such as Hidden Valley Lake, California, join with neighbors in a community cleanup effort to remove brush from their surroundings. ""We clean our lots by June 15,"" said resident Janet Ruiz. ""The homeowners association checks, and if not, they hire someone and charge the homeowner."" Hundreds of wildfire evacuees spending Thanksgiving in Walmart parking lot A wildfire there in 2015 damaged or destroyed 100 homes, but it could have been a lot worse, Ruiz said. Building codes governing fire resistance for new housing, already strict in the state, are likely to be enforced to the letter, she said. Ruiz, who works for the Insurance Information Institute, a group that represents property insurers, said insurers don't necessarily want to charge more. But they will, if California and other dry Western states continue catching fire. It's partly a matter of education and the hard work of cutting down dead trees and clearing brush. Some of that may be in the control of homeowners and insurers. ""But chronic climate risk is the creeping change"" that worries all companies, warned Greg Lowe, global head of resilience at Aon. And that goes far beyond what happens in anyone's immediate surroundings.","Insurers may exclude this type of catastrophe from standard home insurance policies, like they exclude floods",2018-12-12T20:19:14Z,Wildfires may soon be uninsurable risks for homeowners,CBS News,0
"(Reuters Health) - People with psoriasis may be at increased risk of sexual dysfunction, particularly when they also suffer from mood disorders or arthritis, a research review suggests. Researchers examined data from 28 studies with more than 52,000 psoriasis patients and more than 1.8 million people without psoriasis. Those with psoriasis - an autoimmune disorder that causes red, scaly skin patches - had a 5.5-fold higher risk of sexual dysfunction than people without the condition, the analysis found. Psoriatic arthritis, or swollen and inflamed joints that sometimes accompany the skin disorder, was associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction among people with psoriasis, the study also found. So were depression, anxiety and psoriasis flare-ups of itchy, dry skin on the genitals. “Sexual dysfunction may arise more commonly in those with psoriasis for a number of reasons,” said Dr. Jon Goulding of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. “The presence of visible and symptomatic skin lesions, particularly on the genitals, may understandably adversely affect sexual function, through negative effects on self-confidence and self-esteem,” Goulding, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Anxiety and depression often develop in patients with psoriasis for similar reasons, and sexual dysfunction may be a manifestation of profound psychological distress.” Men with psoriasis had a 37 percent to almost four-fold higher risk of erectile dysfunction than men without psoriasis in the eight studies that looked at this specific question. Often, men with psoriasis are obese or have other cardiovascular risk factors that may restrict blood flood in the body, including in the penis. Psoriasis that develops on the penis can also contribute to pain and discomfort during sex or contribute to psychological issues that impair sexual performance, some previous research suggests. Women, too, may find sex painful with psoriasis or experience mood disorders related to the condition that impact their sexual function, previous research has found. Raised patches of dry, scaly, itchy skin are a hallmark of psoriasis. The inflammatory skin condition can be made worse by exposure to stress, cold and infections. Symptoms may be eased by topical ointments and medications, but there is no cure. The current analysis didn’t include controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how psoriasis might directly or indirectly cause sexual dysfunction. But it’s possible that systemic inflammation impacts sex hormones in a way that impairs sexual function, Dr. Alejandro Molina-Leyva and colleagues write in JAMA Dermatology. Molina-Leyva didn’t respond to requests for comment. Even when psoriasis doesn’t stop people from having sex, it may make them feel worse afterward, noted Dr. Alexander Egeberg of Gentofte Hospital in Denmark, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Genital psoriasis lesions may not only be embarrassing for patients, which can cause patients to be psychologically affected, but it can also be painful during intercourse, and genital psoriasis may actually worsen following sexual activity due to friction and skin irritation,” Egeberg said in an email. “Moreover, psoriasis is associated with cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, which may also cause male erectile dysfunction.” Egeberg has received research funding from drug companies that make sexual dysfunction and psoriasis treatments, including Pfizer and Eli Lilly.

"ATHENS (Reuters) - At least two people died in flooding in northern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot media reported on Thursday, as hail and rain hammered the island. Turkish Cypriot media said the victims’ car was swept away during a deluge late Wednesday. Cyprus residents have reported virtually uninterrupted rain since early Tuesday, with some saying it was the heaviest in memory. Flash flooding from an isolated downpour is not uncommon in Cyprus, but sustained floods are rare. Further bad weather was expected on Thursday. “In minutes, it’s gone from beautiful sunshine to freezing cold with rumbles of thunder in the distance. I’m not looking forward to this,” one northern Cyprus resident said. People were sewing sandbags to prevent water seeping through window seals and under doors, she said. Social media images showed cars swept away into the sea, submerged in flood water and water gushing through homes. Normally dry rivers burst their banks, causing damage in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, and forcing the partial closure of a motorway linking the city to Kyrenia, a historic harbor town on the island’s northern coast. Many schools were shut. “I have never seen anything like it,” said Devin Reid, 25, a resident of northern Nicosia. “Our front street looked like a river.” Reporting By Michele Kambas, editing by Larry King","At least two people died in flooding in northern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot media reported on Thursday, as hail and rain hammered the island.",2018-12-06T10:42:35Z,At least two dead as rain and floods lash Cyprus,Reuters,1

"James Woods took to Twitter on Monday to help a veteran who tweeted he was contemplating suicide. Woods attempted to help a man named Andrew MacMasters after the actor came across a since-deleted tweet the veteran posted saying he was going to kill himself because he has “lost everything [and] have nobody.” The 71-year-old actor responded to MacMasters tweet and tried to get him to direct message him. “Tell me where you are,” Woods tweeted. “We can talk. I don’t care what anybody thinks. Do you? Let’s have a conversation. Just you you and I.” “I’m following you now, so you can DM me. We can talk privately. Or we can talk openly right here. Lot of people worried about you right now,” Woods posted on Twitter. “So think about this. A lot of vets, I understand, have come to where you are tonight. If you could just push this decision off tonight, at least, maybe you would also inspire another vet to seek help. You could save another man, too. By waiting to do this.” JAMES WOODS USES TWITTER TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE VICTIMS, CALLS ON HOLLYWOOD STARS TO STOP ‘TROLLING’ AND HELP Woods continued to try to reach out to MacMasters even after his account was deleted. The actor turned to social media users for help to locate the veteran. “Andrew, don’t feel embarrassed that you reached out in the darkness. Nobody thinks you’re foolish for that. You know every one of us reaching out to you right now has some depression, too. I’ll say it. I do,” Woods wrote. The “Once Upon a Time in America” star tweeted at Orlando police to request a welfare check, but later contacted Maitland police in Florida after receiving information that MacMasters resided in that city. “Okay. Just talked to Maitland Police. The dispatch supervisor there was terrific. He’s confident they will find him. I gave Billy, the dispatcher, Andrew’s home address and the info a reliable source DMed me. They are all over this,” he tweeted. “Andrew wasn’t at his home address. @PoliceMaitland is getting assistance from neighboring agencies. They are really on this.” Woods also wrote on Twitter: “If only Andrew could see the THOUSANDS of fellow Americans who are pulling for him. It’s like he’s lost behind enemy lines and we are cheering him home, willing him to survive. Andrew, do this for the ‘other 21’ vets a day who don’t make it home from the darkness. Stay alive!” The actor continued to provide updates throughout the night on MacMasters. He said police did not locate MacMasters at his residence and it’s unclear where he is as of Tuesday morning. This isn’t the first time the “Casino” actor used the social media platform to help the public. He recently called for Hollywood to take a break from “trolling Twitter” to focus on helping victims of California’s destructive wildfires. “Every Californian with a #BlueCheckMark is invited to stop trolling @Twitter today and use your voice to retweet #Evacuation and #Safety advisories instead. Be sure to check the time an advisory was posted,” Woods tweeted last week. “Thank you! #SoCalFiresJamesWoods #CampFireJamesWoods.” Woods' Twitter feed is full of messages ranging from tips to keep animals safe to lists of items needed to safely evacuate.

And last but not least, the animal rights group suggests replacing ""be the guinea pig"" with a phrase that features an inanimate symbol of scientific experimentation: ""Be the test tube.""

"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek authorities searched on Tuesday for a 60-year-old farmer missing on the Aegean island of Crete after days of cold, torrential rain and gales. 
Crete, Greece’s southernmost island and one of its top tourism destinations, has been hit hardest by storms battering the country over the past few days, with roads, buildings and infrastructure damaged across the island and rivers flooding. 
Television images showed a century-old bridge collapsing due to rising water levels. Some homes were protectively evacuated, state TV said. 
More than 30 firemen assisted by volunteers and divers were combing a flood-swollen stream for a farmer whose car was swept away on Monday. “It’s been raining for six days non-stop, I mean (a) storm, not just rain, an incredible amount of water,” said Nikos Lagoudakis, a senior fire brigade official. 
Infrastructure ministry officials and experts traveled with a helicopter to Crete on Monday to assess the extent of the damage. Regional governor Stavros Arnaoutakis said damage could reach dozens of millions of euros. 
In 2017, devastating flash floods following torrential rain killed at least 15 people and made scores homeless in towns west of the capital Athens. A wildfire in July that year killed 100 people in the seaside resort of Mati near Athens.

"KABUL (Reuters) - At least 20 people including children were killed in southern Afghanistan by flash floods that engulfed up to 2,000 homes and swept away cars, the U.N. agency coordinating relief efforts said on Saturday. 
Heavy rains struck Kandahar city and six districts on Friday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement. 
Afghan government officials said hundreds of houses in Herat province were destroyed in flash floods. 
Flood-affected families have been evacuated to secure areas in the districts and Kandahar city, including schools, mosques and government buildings. 
At least 10 people, including children, were missing in Arghandab, Daman, Spin Boldak and Dand districts.

"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Despite mounting signs of a Chinese economic slowdown, 2019 is off to a good start for fund manager Du Zhenye. 
His Shanghai-based ChangAn Xinyi Enhanced Mixed Fund has increased its assets over the past two weeks by shunning Chinese stocks for bonds. And it was the best-performing of nearly 3,000 mixed funds ranked by Haitong Securities for 2018, returning more than 14 percent. 
“I don’t dare say it’s already the bottom of the stock market,” Du said. 
He's not alone in favoring Chinese bonds over equities. Slowing growth signals an earnings slump after a brutal 2018, when the Shanghai Composite index .SSEC tumbled 25 percent. 
For some, bonds retain a shine as policymakers combat the slowdown with more stimulus. The phased inclusion of some Chinese bonds in global indexes starting this year also should draw inflows. 
“We believe this year will be another bullish one for bonds,” said Du. 
According to Shanghai consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, assets under management (AUM) at domestic equity mutual funds shrank 12 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to 194 billion yuan ($28.62 billion) while fixed income funds expanded 20 percent to 3 trillion yuan. 
That was one factor driving yields on benchmark 10-year Chinese government bonds down nearly 40 basis points in the quarter. CN10YT=RR 
More policy easing could further cut yields, implying more gains for bondholders. 
On Monday, China reported 2018 growth was the slowest in 28 years, at 6.6 percent. Beijing will reduce its 2019 full-year growth target to 6-6.5 percent, from around 6.5 percent last year, sources have told Reuters. 
PUMPING CASH 
While authorities rule out “flood-type stimulus” to juice growth, they have pumped cash into the banking system to boost lending. China made a cut to banks’ reserve requirement ratios this month, and more is promised. 
Josh Sheng, chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management, says fresh cash should fuel further gains in bonds, both sovereign and corporate. At the same time, he is watching credit data for signs of an investment pick-up that could support the stock market. 
Interest in Chinese bonds isn’t limited to domestic investors. 
Lenny Kwan, a portfolio manager at T Rowe Price in Hong Kong, is bullish on five- and 10-year government bonds. Edmund Goh, Asian fixed income manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Shanghai, is keen on corporate bonds, largely shunned by foreign investors unfamiliar with the Chinese market. 
Offshore interest is likely to increase in April, when the Bloomberg-Barclays Global Aggregate Index begins to include Chinese government and policy-bank bonds. 
Standard Chartered estimates the inclusion, which will be phased in over 20 months, could bring $50 billion in passive inflows into China’s fixed income market this year. It said offshore investors could own up to 2.8 trillion yuan of onshore bonds by the end of 2019, or 1 trillion yuan more than at the end of last year. 
CREDIT BOMBS 
Not all domestic investors are convinced. Fresh funding has been only enough “to fill the old gaps,” and the People’s Bank of China is keen to avoid excess cash putting pressure on the yuan, said Yun Xiong, partner at Leiton Capital in Shanghai. 
Last year brought a record number of defaults, according to Reuters data, and “credit bombs will continue to explode” in 2019, Xiong said. 
Another factor that could dent bonds is stricter insurance industry rules that took effect in 2018. Huachuang Securities said these reduced returns from insurance products and raised costs for insurers - traditionally big bond buyers. On top of this, weak income growth and rising household debt will hit growth of premiums. 
Some asset managers see more value in Chinese stocks than bonds, believing that more stimulus is coming and that the U.S. and China will resolve their trade war. 
Last year’s market correction led Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Greater China investments at Barings, to pick up a range of stocks. 
Shares on mainland exchanges are “trading at about 11 times (price to earnings). That’s very low,” said Do, who expects China’s economy to rebound in the second quarter. 
Wang Qing, president of Shanghai Chongyang Investment Co, is also optimistic that China shares will rise this year. 
“Market consensus at the start of a year is often wrong,” he said.

"Beira, Mozambique -- The first cases of cholera have been confirmed in the cyclone-ravaged city of Beira, Mozambican authorities announced on Wednesday, raising the stakes in an already desperate fight to help hundreds of thousands of people sheltering in increasingly squalid conditions. The death toll in Mozambique is now at least 468, with 259 dead in Zimbabwe and at least 56 dead in Malawi.
The five cholera cases were confirmed in Munhava, one of the poorest neighborhoods in the hard-hit port city, the national director of medical assistance, Ussene Isse, told reporters. The city of some 500,000 people is still struggling to provide clean water and sanitation after Cyclone Idai roared in on March 14.
Cholera is a major concern for cyclone survivors now living in crowded camps, schools, churches and any land exposed by the still-draining flood waters. The disease is spread by contaminated food and water, causes acute diarrhea and can kill within hours if not treated with oral rehydration solution or intravenous fluids in severe cases.
The World Health Organization has warned of a ""second disaster"" if waterborne diseases like cholera spread in the devastated region. On Tuesday it said 900,000 oral cholera vaccines were expected to arrive later this week.

Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi was to address the nation on Wednesday afternoon about how his government is responding to the cyclone, which has left 1.8 million people in need of urgent help.
Nyusi early last week estimated that 1,000 people had been killed after he flew over the vast, flooded plains of central Mozambique. The toll could be higher, said some emergency responders, who said that more bodies will be found as floodwaters drain away. They said the actual figure of dead may never be known.
Health workers were opening clinics across Beira, the center of relief operations for the region.
Some people in the city have resorted to drinking stagnant water by the side of the road, increasing the chances of diarrhea, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said. Other people are drinking from contaminated wells.
The aid group said it has seen hundreds of cases of acute watery diarrhea in the past few days.
""The scale of extreme damage will likely lead to a dramatic increase of waterborne diseases, skin infections, respiratory tract infections and malaria in the coming days and weeks,"" said Gert Verdonck, the group's emergency coordinator in Beira.
Hurried efforts continued to restore running water to Beira. The United Nations children's agency said parts of the city's water supply system were working again, with ""water running in 60 percent of the pipes."" The government also was operating water trucks.
Climate change's role in severe storms and extreme flooding
Relief operations continued to explore ways to deliver aid to the city that remains largely reachable only by air and sea. More challenging was reaching rural communities, some of them still without contact with the outside world.
More humanitarian actors arrived as the United Nations urges the international community to fund a $282 million emergency appeal for the next three months.
The U.N. refugee agency announced that its first aid flight had landed in the capital, Maputo, with plans to immediately transport the tents, mosquito nets and other items to Beira.
Two other flights are planned for Zimbabwe and Malawi this week.","Illness caused by fetid water, lack of sanitation in cut-off communities compounding disaster, with 5 cases of cholera confirmed",2019-03-27T11:11:34Z,Cholera confirmed as cyclone death toll mounts in Mozambique,CBS News,0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will take steps to spur growth amid a trade war with the United States, but there is limited room for aggressive stimulus in an economy already laden with massive debts and a property market prone to credit-driven spikes, policy insiders said. 
China’s deepening economic slowdown has fanned market expectations of a big spending binge, especially if the bruising tariff war with Washington escalates, intensifying pressure on Chinese jobs threatening social stability. 
Such a move, plans for which have repeatedly been denied by China’s top leaders, would come at a price, however - similar moves in the past have quickly juiced growth rates but also buried the world’s No.2 economy under a mountain of debt. 
“The room for a strong stimulus is not big, and there are very big risks, because that will rely on a flood of cash and increased leverage in the economy,” said a policy insider, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
During the 2008-09 global financial crisis, Beijing rolled out a 4 trillion yuan ($591 billion) spending package to fight a downturn that cost 20 million jobs in a matters of months, quickly reviving growth but also prompting a credit explosion. 
The obsession of China’s leaders with stability led to policy easing in 2012 and 2015 - a year marked by a stock market crash, a slide in the yuan and sharp capital outflows - that further pushed up debt levels and inflated home prices. 
Authorities have taken a raft of pro-growth measures in the past year, in the form of cuts to the levels of cash banks must hold as reserves to spur lending, tax cuts, and efforts to accelerate infrastructure spending. 
Still, growth in the world’s second-largest economy weakened to a 28-year low of 6.6 percent in 2018, and is expected to slow further to 6.3 percent this year. 
Sources have told Reuters that Beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6-6.5 percent this year from around 6.5 percent in 2018. 
Some Chinese factories have felt the pinch from higher U.S. tariffs, but there are few signs of a sharp rise in unemployment due to a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country’s demographic changes. 
“We should be vigilant about employment pressure, but it’s too early to talk about serious problems,” said a second policy insider. 
DEBT RISKS 
The current slowdown was caused by China’s deleveraging drive in early 2016, which focused on state firms and local governments before broadening to the financial sector a year later. A crackdown on shadow lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for small firms to get funds. 
As the trade war increases headwinds, Beijing’s policy focus has been shifted to supporting growth from reining in debt risks, although top leaders remain worried about long-term systemic risks that could derail the country’s economic ascent. 
President Xi Jinping said this week that China must be on guard against “black swan” risks, meaning unforeseen events that have extreme consequences, while fending off so-called “grey rhino” events - obvious threats that go ignored. 
Data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) showed that China’s debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio climbed to 253 percent at the end of June 2018 from 231 percent at end-2015, although the pace of increases is slowing. 
Fitch could cut China’s A+ credit rating or stable outlook if Beijing reverts to the kind of debt-fueled stimulus programs it has used in the past, the firm’s top sovereign analyst said earlier this month. 
Further reductions in banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRR) are expected in coming quarters, but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates. More aggressive easing could pressure the yuan, aggravate high debt levels, and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers. 
“If there is too much liquidity, we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas, rather than the real economy,” said a policy adviser. 
NO QUICK BOOST TO GROWTH 
China is likely to lean more on fiscal pump-priming to support the economy this year, as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs, policy insiders said. 
In December, top leaders pledged to step up “counter-cyclical” support for the economy, and said fiscal policy would be “more forceful and effective” and monetary policy would be prudent with “appropriate tightness and looseness”. 
Details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in March. 
Analysts expect China to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019, versus last year’s 1.3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off-budget special bonds to fund key projects, up from 1.35 trillion yuan. 
But the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in, and China’s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending. 
“Stimulus won’t be very strong, and its impact won’t be big,” said one of the policy insiders.

“The manufacturing sector faces all round oversupply while infrastructure investment is saturated in many places projects that have been launched won’t make money.” 
New tax cuts, including lowering the valued-added tax (VAT) for firms, could give hard-pressed small and private firms a shot in the arm and force the government to tighten its belt. The finance ministry has pledged a 5 percent cut in “general government spending”.

"DOHA/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar’s Doha Tower, a spike-tipped cylinder that glows orange at night, won an award when finished in 2012 amid a Gulf-wide real estate boom, but today about half of its 46 floors are empty. 
The office tower, now a familiar part of the capital’s high-rise skyline, has run foul of what real estate brokers, bankers and analysts say is an oversupplied Qatar property market ahead of the 2022 World Cup that mirrors a real estate downturn in the wider Gulf region after a drop in oil prices. 
Qatar has the added challenge of a diplomatic, trade and transport boycott imposed on the Gulf Arab state by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt over allegations that Doha supports Islamist militants, a charge Qatar denies. 
The protracted row has made it tough to lure would-be foreign buyers of residential or commercial space. 
Residential prices are down about 10 percent from June 2017, when the boycott began, and office prices have fallen by a similar rate, according to analysts and economists. Rents are down 20 percent from three years ago, they say. 
“Qatar’s property sector has been one of the main casualties from the blockade that was imposed in mid-2017,” Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said. 
The property downturn has so far not translated into bad loans, as bankers say borrowers holding sluggish real estate assets tend to be among the country’s wealthiest. 
“They have capacity to withstand the market ... I don’t see a major threat,” Doha Bank CEO Raghavan Setharaman said, when asked about his view of the real estate market. 
A banker at Al-Khalij Commercial Bank said banks like his have been restructuring many property loans in recent months, extending them to 20-year payment periods from 10 in some cases, to keep business moving for developers hit by slow demand. 
But with the World Cup edging closer, real estate experts say long-planned projects are now set to flood the market, even as buildings in prime locations, like Doha Tower, sit idle. 
“It’ll be interesting to see what happens when they (real estate prices) are really put under pressure in a year’s time, when a lot of new supply hits the market,” Johnny Archer, Associate Director of DTZ, a Doha-based real estate firm, said. 
WORLD CUP FRENZY 
Tiny but wealthy Qatar, the world’s top liquefied natural gas exporter, plans to increase residential space by about 50 percent and office space by 40 percent in the next three years, partly on expected demand from the World Cup, according to a report published last week by real estate company DTZ. 
The lion’s share of construction underway is for high-end residential towers, white-collar office space, and luxury hotels and shopping malls. 
FIFA requires Qatar have at least 60,000 hotel rooms in place for the month-long World Cup tournament, which Qatar estimates will draw about 1.5 million fans - more than half of its roughly 2.6 million population. 
Qatar has about 26,500 rooms and will add another 15,000 by 2022, DTZ’s report estimated. The rest will be met by rooms aboard cruise ships and in desert camps, according to the local World Cup organizing committee. These camps are expected to be bedouin-style accommodation to give visitors a taste of desert life. 
Much of the building is in an entirely new city, Lusail, a 38-square kilometer stretch just north of Doha dotted by commercial towers, hotels, and shopping centers at various stages of construction. 
Lusail is being developed by state-controlled Qatari Diar Real Estate Company, which envisions it hosting 200,000 residents and 170,000 employees. It is anchored by Qatar’s largest World Cup stadium, an 80,000 seat venue that will host the opening and closing matches. 
Colliers International, whose office was an early entrant to Lusail, says getting companies to fill a rush of towers coming online ahead of 2022 will be a daunting task. 
“There’s going to be massive structural oversupply for office infrastructure for the foreseeable future,” said Colliers’ Qatar country director Adrian Camps. 
In a bid to spur activity, Qatar last month ratified an investment law allowing foreigners full ownership of companies, and for years Qatar has designated certain high-end areas like Lusail open to foreigners, but brokers say demand remains low. 
Shopping malls, lacking the Saudi or Emirati shoppers who once flocked to them before the boycott, are among the most visibly affected, with some having to shutter shops in recent months. 
New malls are being built anyway. 
Total retail space has doubled in three years and will grow 50 percent more by 2021 with nine new malls, according to DTZ. 
Beyond 2022, Qatar real estate faces an uncertain outlook. Aside from soccer stadiums, Qatar has not specified legacy plans for what happens to infrastructure developed for the World Cup after the tournament. 
“There’s too much uncertainty as to where that demand specifically is going to come from,” Richard Rayner, who surveys property for DTZ said.

“We cannot rule out a (benchmark) rate cut, but we still need to watch economic data for a few months,” one said. “There is no sufficient reason for cutting benchmark rates if we look at the huge amount of new loans in January.” 
China’s trading partners and major central banks are increasingly concerned over how quickly the world’s second-largest economy is decelerating and much it will drag on global growth. 
Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Wednesday that China will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus like that unleashed in past downturns. But after a spate of weak data, investors are asking if Beijing needs to speed up or intensify support to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expect China’s official growth rate to cool to 6.3 percent in 2019, a 29-year low, and some believe real activity levels are already much weaker than government data suggest. [ECILT/CN] 
But China watchers note the PBOC has many policy tools to choose from before wielding blunter instruments such as a lending rate cut, which would lower financing costs across the board but risk adding to a mountain of debt. 
More RRR cuts have been expected in coming quarters after five in the past year, most recently in January. The PBOC has also been guiding money market rates lower in various ways, and offered a slightly better rate on a new medium-term lending program launched in January. 
The PBOC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. 
WAITING FOR SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND 
In one sign that recent policy loosening measures may be starting to be felt, China’s mostly state-backed banks doled out a record 3.23 trillion yuan ($480.43 billion) in loans in January, following months of urging by the PBOC to keep financing open to cash-strapped companies. 
But the PBOC was quick to say after the data that it has not opened the credit floodgates. 
Analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth, suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better. 
But the government is also planning to step up fiscal stimulus ranging from more infrastructure spending to sweeping tax cuts, building on moves last year. 
In the last downturn in 2014-2015, China cut the benchmark six times. But it has kept the benchmark at 4.35 percent since October 2015 while the central bank focuses on building a more market-based regime that will get funding to parts of the economy that need it most. 
Only a handful of analysts have predicted a benchmark cut this time around, but speculation has been growing that the PBOC may take other action soon as deflationary pressures build and the yuan strengthens, threatening more pressure on exporters. 
Data last week showed January producer price inflation cooled for a seventh straight month. 
The yuan has gained about 2.6 percent against the dollar this year, buoyed by hopes for progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, after falling 5.3 percent in 2018. 
LOST IN TRANSMISSION? 
While the PBOC has been pushing a lot of funds into the financial system, the money has not been flowing smoothly to companies, particularly private firms which account for over half of China’s economy. 
Banks are wary of lending to smaller firms with higher credit risks, preferring state-backed customers, while businesses are reluctant to take on debt when sales and profits are weakening. Bond defaults hit a record last year. 
That has prompted the central bank to become more innovative in developing new policy tools to encourage growth. 
Most recently, it allowed banks to issue perpetual bonds, in a major step toward recapitalization of the country’s banks that could give them more room to lend. 
PBOC officials say policy steps are starting to show some results. The average lending rate for small firms fell to 6.16 percent in January from 6.37 percent a year earlier. 
But analysts caution it is too early to tell if many firms are refinancing existing debt or planning new investments. DBS economists said recently that real interest rates (the benchmark rate minus producer inflation) have shot up to 4.3 percent. 
Societe Generale expects PBOC to cut the 7-day reverse repo rate by at least 20 basis points by end-2019 and could cut other market-based rates, while lowering RRR by 100 bps each quarter. 
Sources believe a benchmark cut may only happen if the economy slows abruptly and broad-based deflation emerges, but they expect stimulus measures will start to put a floor under economic growth around mid-year. 
A trade deal between China and the United States would also reduce the chance of a benchmark cut, sources said. Negotiators are racing to meet a March 1 deadline, and failure could lead to a sharp hike in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 
A benchmark cut could also been seen as a setback in long-promised reforms to allow market forces to determine the cost of capital in China, which is key to producing more sustainable and higher quality growth and reducing inefficient investment. 
“There are many tools in the central bank’s toolkit, and financing costs could fall as liquidity is ample and policy transmission mechanism improves,” said one of the sources.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrencies may be facing a prolonged bear market. 
Companies that issued tokens, or digital currencies, over the last two years through initial coin offerings (ICOs) may have to sell more of these assets to finance their operations. There’s just one problem: There are very few takers. 
After the blockbuster success of ICOs in 2017, with funds raised at more than $6 billion, cryptocurrencies nosedived, wiping out about 85 percent of their total market value since hitting a peak of more than $800 billion in early 2018. 
Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has dropped more than 80 percent since hitting an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. 
A global regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created fear about greater oversight and acceptance of the currencies for payments among the companies issuing the tokens and the investors that bought them, taking the wind out of the once red-hot digital assets. Data from Dead Coins, which tracks crypto startups, showed that around 1,000 of these companies either failed in the last year or their projects have now been abandoned. 
For digital currencies still in the market, the prospect of incoming supply - some with a predetermined schedule - could pose a challenge to their businesses given the current downturn in the market. 
“Many people don’t fully understand the impact of new supply on this market particularly when there’s low liquidity,” said Ryan Selkis, co-founder of Messari, a crypto data platform in New York. “I don’t think anyone has any idea how much hidden inflation there is in the form of token reserves that are going to be unwound gradually.” 
Data from Messari showed that 71 coins of the more than 400 tokens on its database have issued less than 50 percent of their targeted total supply, which means there is a flood of these assets that could be sold to the market or distributed in some shape or form. 
(Graphic: Token Glut - tmsnrt.rs/2Bp78zw) 
ZCash, a more than two-year-old digital currency with strong privacy features, has 28.05 percent of its total supply issued so far, according to Messari data. That means its token holders could see the supply mushroom more than three-fold in the years ahead, which would pressure coin values unless outweighed by demand. 
The supply pressure is not just coming from companies that need to sell tokens to finance their operations, but also from early investors in ICOs who were given investment contracts that give them the right to future tokens. The terms of those contracts are at the discretion of the company raising the funds, or the issuer of the token. 
Those tokens have liquidity provisions that allow investors to sell them, but have found it difficult to do so because the coins are now under water, analysts said. 
“I think a lot of these tokens have been issued on the assumption of a very bullish crypto market on all fronts,” said Kyle R. Chapman, a partner at Boston-based COSIMO Ventures, a private equity and venture capital firm focused on early-stage technology companies. 
REDUCING SUPPLY 
Although a cap on the total number of any one token was designed as a measure to help preserve value, that has not prevented a supply glut as demand has plunged. 
The total number of bitcoins that could ever be created, for instance, is around 21 million, of which around 17.5 million, or 83 percent, have already been minted. 
By contrast, the governments and central banks that control so-called fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar can issue more at will, diminishing their value over time. 
Some digital currency issuers have tried to minimize the impact of price declines by undertaking measures to reduce token supply, with varying degrees of success. 
Less than a year after crypto inheritance startup DigiPulse sold its token to the public in October 2017, the company moved to detokenize its business by accepting fiat currencies, with the aim of eliminating speculation on its currency. The company eventually shut down. 
By accepting fiat money as payment, these companies effectively abandon their ICO investors and render their virtual unit less valuable, said consulting firm Ernst and Young in a report on ICOs released last October. 
Other companies have resorted to burning their own tokens and removing them from circulation, similar to share buybacks. By cutting the number of tokens, companies hope to make the currencies that remain in circulation rarer and more valuable. 
In token burning, miners and developers typically purchase coins from investors and then send them to specialized addresses that have unobtainable private keys. Without access to a private key, no one can use these tokens, putting them outside the circulating supply. 
Companies like Tron, a decentralized application platform, and Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, have burned their tokens. 
The problem with token burning, however, is that companies need funds to buy back the tokens from investors before they can burn them, said COSIMO’S Chapman. But many of these startups do not have the cash to burn their tokens because of the decline in the value of their own coins. 
It has become a vicious cycle, analysts said. Companies need their investors to use their tokens to grow their platform and network, but their currencies have become pure speculative investments. 
However, by removing their tokens from circulation, the startups limit the growth of their products, which rely on the use of these digital assets. 
“Their business model is predicated on increasing the value of their protocol tokens,” said Josh Stein, chief executive officer at Harbor Inc in San Francisco, which runs a platform that helps converts securities into tokens backed by assets such as real estate. “The big beatdown in valuations is a big threat to their business models,” he said.

"Los Angeles --  Heavy rains drenched Southern California Monday, raising mudslide concerns in recent burn areas and prompting evacuations, CBS Los Angeles reports.
A mudslide late Monday morning forced the closure of a stretch of Pacific Coast Highway, which remained blocked until about 4 p.m.
Meanwhile, snowfall in the northern reaches of Los Angeles County prompted a full closure of a highway where multiple vehicles were reported stuck in the snow.
This, a year after a mudslide swept through a fire-devastated California town, killing 21 people.
Residents of hundreds homes in burn areas were told to pack up with the Pacific storm threatening potential catastrophe.
In Riverside County east of Los Angeles, evacuations were ordered Monday for a dozen areas around the Holy Fire, which swept through an enormous swath of the Cleveland National Forest and surrounding areas last August.
""People in these zones MUST GO NOW. Rainstorms carry the potential for dangerous debris flows that can send mud, boulders and trees crashing down hillsides"" with little or no warning, a county statement said.
The evacuation was later downgraded to voluntary, but authorities urged people to stay alert because of continuing rain forecasts.
In Santa Barbara County on the central coast, evacuation orders were set to take effect at 10 a.m. Tuesday for areas hit by the Sherpa, Whittier and Thomas fires.
""Gather family members, pets, and essential items,"" a county statement said. A debris flow could also make roads impassable and strand people near the evacuation areas, especially in Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria, the county warned.
After a devastating fire that burned and destabilized foothills, Montecito was hit by a powerful storm on Jan. 9, 2018, that sent water, mud and boulders sluicing down creeks and canyons. Twenty-three people died and over 100 homes were destroyed.
Weather forecasters have predicted a series of storms that could continue to bring rain and snow into the middle of the week. Flash flood watches were issued by the National Weather Service for burn areas in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, which could see as much as an inch of rain per hour from Tuesday afternoon into the evening.
All schools in Malibu were closed Tuesday.
Flooding and debris flows were a threat to hundreds of homes in areas below foothills and canyons that were swept by flames in recent years.
Los Angeles County authorities issued evacuation orders beginning Tuesday morning for some areas of the Woolsey Fire. The blaze that broke out in November destroyed more than 1,500 homes and other buildings from Ventura County to Malibu and killed four people.
On Monday, the first in the series of storms dumped an inch of rain in Los Angeles and snow in the mountains.
Rain closed the Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement parks.

"Virginia House Democrats are deferring to law enforcement officials to carry out their investigation into accusations that Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted two women. This comes after a delegate in the Virginia legislature backed down from calls he made to impeach Fairfax. 
Democrat Patrick Hope had threatened to introduce articles of impeachment against Fairfax, telling reporters that there is ""no question that violent sexual assault qualifies as an impeachable high crime."" Hope said that he had drafted language for his colleagues as a first step to take action against the Lt. Governor. 
As such, the House Democratic Caucus has called on Lt. Governor Fairfax to resign. We are willing to work in a bipartisan manner with members of the General Assembly on a path forward.
— VA House Democrats (@VAHouseDems) February 19, 2019
But the Virginia House Democrats said in a statement on Tuesday that they believe the investigation into Fairfax should ""proceed unencumbered and outside the political arena."" They reiterated their calls for Fairfax to resign, but added ""we are willing to work in a bipartisan manner with members of the General Assembly on a path forward.""
Lawyers for one of Fairfax's accusers, Meredith Watson, slammed the Democrats in a statement, saying ""Apparently, the Virginia House Democratic Caucus believes that courageous victims of rape need to be heard — just not by them. Ms. Watson is counting on the General Assembly to do the right thing and hold hearings now. These nonstop efforts to duck their role is pure cowardice. Sympathy is welcome, but action is needed.""
In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Watson said since coming forward with details of her encounter with Fairfax, during which she claims the Lt. Gov had raped her while they were students at Duke in 2000, she has ""endured relentless scrutiny of my personal life and an unending, bitter flood of hurtful misinformation trumpeted by the media."" Watson said despite the legislature's ""inaction,"" she's still willing to testify publicly under oath. 
""I am frustrated by calls for an investigation rather than a public hearing into these matters,"" she said. ""Such 'investigations' are secret proceedings, out of the public eye, leaving victims vulnerable to selective leaks and smears. And we all know how such investigations end: with 'inconclusive results.'""
According to staffers within the Virginia Democratic caucus, once lawmakers adjourn this weekend, they are expected to return to Richmond for a ""reconvened session"" on  April 3 to take up vetoes from the governor and amendments. It's possible they could also address the Fairfax controversy again at this time or they could be called back for a special session. That would be up to the Speaker of the House, Republican Kirk Cox. 
Officials stress that ""nothing is off the table"" in terms of impeachment proceedings, but for now they want to see how things develop with law enforcement first.
Fairfax remains adamant about staying in office, saying that he would not resign and instead has called on ""all appropriate and impartial investigatory authorities, including the FBI, to investigate fully and thoroughly the allegations against me."" 
The Democrat was first accused of sexually assaulting Vanessa Tyson at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 where he allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him. Days later, Watson came forward with her own allegations.

"San Francisco -- A Category 3 atmospheric river taking aim at Northern California is unleashing torrential downpours that could dump as much as 8 inches of rain, CBS SF Bay Area reports.  ""An atmospheric river with origins near Hawaii will take aim at the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast Wednesday through Thursday morning,"" weather service forecasters warned. ""Rainfall rates of at least half an inch per hour are possible during the heaviest showers, with the highest rates in the higher terrain.""
The jet stream was carrying a plume of the storm front from the Hawaiian Islands to the West Coast. Over the weekend, the Hawaiian storm brought heavy downpours, high winds, pounding surf and a historic dusting of snow above 6,000 feet on Maui.
By the time the system clears the Bay Area on Thursday, 2-3 inches of rain could fall on the North Bay, while 1-2 inches could fall in San Francisco and Oakland. The coastal mountains could see 4-6 inches.
Forecasters warned some areas may see as much as 8 inches.
The weather service issued several watches and warnings in anticipation of the fury. A flash flood watch and a high wind warning were issued for the region from 10 p.m. Tuesday to 10 a.m. Thursday.
While the rain began falling steadily on Tuesday evening, the brunt of the storm was predicted to hit the San Francisco Bay Area during the Wednesday morning commute.
""The Wednesday morning commute will be adversely impacted with flooding roadways and ponding of water expected,"" the weather service warned. ""Periods of heavy rain are also possible during the Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning commutes.""

Mudslides could also occur in areas where hillsides were saturated by storms in early February. 
Santa Clara County is expected to see threats of flooding, reservoir levels increasing and likely more mudslides with this week's next round of storms. 
""Mudslides happen when the soil gets very saturated from the rain, and when the rain starts to run off it often takes the loose soils with it,"" said San Jose State department chair and professor of civil environmental engineering, Laura Sullivan-Green. ""That's the type of slide we'll see now."" 
She said that while it's difficult to predict large mudslides like the one that shutdown Highway 17 in 2017 during a particularly heavy rainy winter, we will likely see smaller scale slides this week because the ground is already saturated from recent storms. 
The threat of slides and mud flows, she said, lasts briefly after the rain stops.
""We'll see a lot of small landslides or mudslides and we may see possibly some larger events, but I would definitely expect a lot of small movements,"" Sullivan-Green said. 
Last month, Maryam Hashemi of Los Gatos almost lost her home after a nearby creek flooded it. Now, she's warning others to clean drains, cut tree limbs and check nearby creeks for debris. 
""I think everybody should clean their creeks before the rainy season and trim their trees,"" she said. 
In the mountains, the storm system will create chaotic conditions. The initial pulse on Wednesday will be fueled by warm, moist air that will raise the snow levels to 6,000-7,000 feet, with rain falling at lower levels. But the second pulse of the storm rolling in over the weekend will send the snow levels to 2,000 feet.

To the north, downtown San Francisco received more than 1.75 inches of rain over 24 hours. Across San Francisco Bay, a woman escaped serious injury when her hillside home was swept away during a mudslide.
It was just before 3 a.m. when a 200 foot hillside collapsed just north of the Golden Gate Bridge. A fast moving mud flow tore trees, before leveling the home where 70-year-old Susan Gordon lay in rubble up to her neck, CBS News' Mola Lenghi reports. ""I could hear her calling for help,"" said Rosaleen Bolger. ""She was trapped. The cops showed up and he coached her, just to keep calm.""

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to set a lower economic growth target of 6-6.5 percent in 2019 compared with last year’s target of “around” 6.5 percent, policy sources told Reuters, as Beijing gears up to cope with higher U.S. tariffs and weakening domestic demand. 
The proposed target, to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in March, was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in mid-December, according to four sources with knowledge of the meeting’s outcome. 
Data later this month is expected to show the Chinese economy grew around 6.6 percent in 2018 - the weakest since 1990. Analysts are forecasting a further loss of momentum this year before policy support steps begin to kick in. 
“It’s very difficult for growth to exceed 6.5 percent (this year), and there could be trouble if growth dips below 6 percent,” said one source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
As the world’s second-largest economy loses steam, China’s top leaders are closely watching employment levels as factories could be forced to shed workers amid a trade war with the United States, despite a more resilient services sector, policy insiders said. 
Growth of about 6.2 percent is needed in the next two years to meet the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020, and to turn China into a “modestly prosperous” nation. 
“Considering employment, income and stability, we need growth of at least 6 percent this year,” said one of the sources. 
Adopting a range as a target would give policymakers room to maneuver amid uncertainties caused by a tit-for-tat tariff war with the United Sates, as the two sides strive for a possible deal to settle their differences before March. 
The government plans to maintain a 3 percent consumer inflation target for 2019 despite a recent softening in price rises, leaving some space for the government to stimulate weaker consumption. 
Data this week showed China’s consumer inflation eased to 1.9 percent in December from 2.2 percent in November, below the government’s full-year target. 
The State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
MORE STIMULUS SEEN 
Chinese leaders have turned more pro-growth since the December meeting, softening a drive to rein in financial and debt risks, but they have ruled out “flood-like” stimulus. 
“The pressure on the economy is quite big, and overall policy focus is stability this year and even next year,” said one of the sources. 
The central bank is likely to pump out more cash by further lowering banks’ reserve requirements, following a broad-based cut this month, while trying to funnel more credit to small and private firms - vital for growth and jobs, policy sources said. 
Policymakers remain reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates despite easing pressure on the yuan, fearing any moves could spur capital outflows as China’s short-term bond yields have fallen below those of the United States, they said. 
The government is expected to step up fiscal stimulus this year with steeper tax cuts to help corporates and an increase in spending on infrastructure projects, the sources said. 
The annual budget deficit could rise from last year’s 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, but is likely to be kept below 3 percent, the sources said without giving specific figures.

Local governments could be allowed to issue up to 2 trillion yuan worth of special bonds in 2019, up from 1.35 trillion yuan last year, they said. 
On tax cuts, the focus will be on possibly lowering valued-added tax (VAT), which ranges from 6 percent for the services sector and 16 percent for manufacturers. Such taxes account for more than a third of total government revenues. 
Policymakers are unlikely to loosen controls on the property market across the country, but may give provincial and city governments more leeway in tweaking polices to keep local markets steady, the sources said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The March floods that punished the U.S. Midwest have roiled the ethanol industry, hammering prices and trapping barrels in the country’s interior while the U.S. coasts suffer from shortages of the biofuel. 
The historic March floods have dealt a series of blows to large swaths of an ethanol industry that was already struggling with high inventories and sluggish domestic demand growth. And the ethanol shortages are one factor pushing gasoline prices in Los Angeles and Southern California to the highest in the nation and they could top $4 a gallon for the first time since 2014, according to tracking firm GasBuddy. 
Benchmark price for ethanol used in most supply contracts initially jumped on news of the floods but has been hobbled by rising waters around the Chicago hub that have halted barges and sales. That stands in contrast to prices on the coasts, which rose dramatically - drawing in heavy imports from Brazil, the main U.S. ethanol competitor. 
The floods inflicted billions of dollars in damage to crops and homes in the U.S. Midwest, and knocked out roughly 13 percent of ethanol capacity. 
U.S. ethanol is made from corn and required by the government to be blended into the nation’s fuel supply to reduce emissions. 
While some ethanol plants were flooded, the primary effect of the rising waters was to shut rail lines that serve as the main arteries for corn and ethanol deliveries. 
Ethanol prices on the coasts spiked due to shortages, but Midwest producers have been unable to take advantage because of washed-out rail lines, market sources told Reuters. 
“Unfortunately for anyone who was impacted by logistics issues it was a double whammy. You couldn’t capture the rally,” said one trader. 
At Chicago’s Argo terminal, the nation’s main ethanol pricing hub, the cash price for ethanol fell for an eighth straight session last week to $1.29 a gallon, the longest downward skid since April of last year, according to Oil Price Information Service, which does daily assessments. 
Initially, fears of widespread plant outages boosted that benchmark, but plants proved more resilient than expected, continuing to produce despite logistical challenges. 
U.S. ethanol inventories were at 24 million barrels for the week ended March 29, just off a record hit a week earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
Chicago’s price acts as the benchmark for millions of barrels bought and sold via longer-term supply contracts each day. While that price faltered, ethanol prices at the coast have surged, helping plants owned by Pacific Ethanol Inc and White Energy in California and Texas to take advantage of higher prices. 
Ethanol delivered into Los Angeles typically trades at 20 cents a gallon higher than Chicago, but that premium rose to as high as 50 cents a gallon, traders said. The price in New York Harbor was at roughly double normal levels, traders said. 
The tight ethanol supplies, along with refinery outages, boosted retail gasoline prices and led to some gas station shutdowns in the West as blenders there lacked the ethanol needed to blend with gasoline to make fuel that meets government regulations. 
Gas prices in Arizona averaged $2.88 per gallon on Sunday, 17 percent higher than last month, according to the American Automobile Association. Prices were even steeper in California at $3.78 a gallon, well above the national average of $2.74 a gallon.

“Ultimately, Los Angeles could get close to seeing that average at $4 a gallon,” Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy, said, adding that much of that increase will come because of refinery outages in the state. 
At least one county in California has already surpassed $4 a gallon. The highest recorded average price for the state was $4.67 a gallon, in October 2012, according to AAA. 
The high coastal prices attracted barrels from the biggest U.S. competitor: Brazil. Overall ethanol imports to the United States totaled 558,279 barrels in March, the most seasonally since 2013, according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data. Most of the imports during the month came from Brazil, according to the tracking data.

"Columbus, Miss. — Weekend storms raked parts of the Southeast, leaving deaths and injuries in their wake as a tornado smashed into a commercial district in a small Mississippi city and drenching rains fed a rising flood threat. The twister destroyed one church – but a baptism went ahead as scheduled the very next day.
At First Pentecostal Church in Columbus, Mississippi, the Rev. Steve Blaylock said the building was ""a total loss,"" with a wall pushed in, holes in the roof and substantial water damage. He and his congregants tried to salvage what they could on the morning after the storm. 
But he said they still held a Sunday prayer service and even went ahead with a scheduled baptism, using a borrowed portable baptismal pool.

""We will rebuild. We've got a good church here,"" Blaylock said. ""It'll be a testimony of God.""
A woman was killed when a tornado hit Columbus, and a man died when he drove into floodwaters in Tennessee, officials said.
Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. said 41-year-old Ashley Glynell Pounds of Tupelo and her husband were renovating a house Saturday evening, and when the husband went to get them something to eat, the building collapsed in the storm and killed her.
""She loved giving back to the community, she loved helping and she stood behind her motto, we gotta give back to the community.  No matter who it was, circumstances, if you called her and told her you needed something she was going to make sure you got it,"" Pounds' friend, Chiquita Bobo, told CBS affiliate WCBI-TV.

The massive storm has dropped as much as one foot to 1.5 feet of rain in some areas of northern Mississippi, Alabama and into Tennessee, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli. 
Smith said 12 other people were injured, but the injuries did not appear to be major. City spokesman Joe Dillon said the tornado also seriously damaged a school and two community center buildings.
""There was pretty extensive damage,"" Dillon said Sunday, a day after the Columbus twister struck. ""But the streets today have been filled with workers and volunteers, all working hard to clean up the mess.""
In Knox County, Tennessee, officials said a man died after his vehicle became submerged in high water.
Saturday afternoon's tornado in Columbus was confirmed on radar, said meteorologist Anna Wolverton with the National Weather Service in Jackson. She told The Associated Press that experts were dispatched Sunday to the east Mississippi city of about 23,000 people to gauge the tornado's intensity. Officials said a second, smaller twister damaged a mobile home and a shed and snapped trees in a small community in the region that same afternoon as severe storms rolled through.
Residents of one street on the east side of Columbus were out early Sunday morning with chain saws, clearing away branches of the many trees that had snapped or were uprooted in the storm. Metal siding and roofing materials were scattered throughout the neighborhood of older homes. While the houses generally remained standing, sheds and outbuildings were mostly demolished.
Lee Lawrence, who said he has been selling used cars for decades in Columbus, told The AP that four buildings on his car lot were destroyed. He said trees toppled across vehicles and car windows were blown out.
Lawrence said he was at home getting ready to take a bath when the storm struck.
""The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close,"" he said, speaking with AP in a phone interview.
""It will be a start-over deal,"" Lawrence said. ""I can't say it will come back better or stronger, but we'll come back.""
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrence's lot were resting in the debris of a destroyed building a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe.
Elsewhere around the South, homes, highways, parks and bridges were flooded or put out of commission amid the heavy rains and severe storms.
News outlets report that water rescues have been performed in some Middle Tennessee counties.
Interstate 40 near the Tennessee line with North Carolina was closed by a rockslide, one of the dozens of roads and highways shut down throughout the region, transportation officials said.
Officials said a mudslide destroyed a Subway restaurant in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. No injuries were reported.
In West Virginia, authorities have evacuated 11 families in the southern part of the state after low-lying areas flooded from heavy rains. Workers cleaned up from mudslides and high wind warnings remained in effect Sunday for much of the state. More than 50,000 customers were without power at one point, emergency officials said, warning driving would be difficult in high winds and more power lines could fall.
In Bruce, Mississippi, rivers broke flood stage and flash floods poured into homes and businesses. News outlets report that officials in Grenada, Mississippi, declared a local state of emergency after dozens of streets and homes flooded. A 6-mile (9-kilometer) stretch of the Natchez Trace Parkway was closed in Mississippi after water covered part of the road.
Kentucky announced Friday that it was closing the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois, because of flooding on the southern approach. The bridge, which carries 4,700 vehicles a day, is likely to stay closed until Thursday, and possibly longer.
The Ohio River at Cairo was predicted to crest Sunday at its third-highest level ever recorded, and stay that high into next week.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - It was created as a biting satire of South Korea’s notoriously competitive education system, but the country’s most popular cable TV drama has inspired some fans to ignore its warnings and instead double down on their pursuit of success. 
“SKY Castle” follows several ambitious families as their drive to send their children to the country’s best universities and secure lucrative jobs leads to identity fraud, suicide and murder. 
The show’s name comes from a fictionalized version of luxury residential community in Seoul’s suburbs, but is also a nod to the acronym “SKY,” which refers to South Korea’s top three universities: Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. 
It’s the most-watched drama ever to air on South Korean cable networks, according to Nielsen Korea, and has found a wide following in China. 
As the series came to an end this week, however, there were signs the show has led some South Koreans adopt some of the more intense educational measures the creators intended to criticize. 
Sales of the “studycube”, a 2.5 million won ($2,235) wooden closet less than one square meter in size where students can hide themselves away to focus on their homework, for example, have soared eight-fold after it was featured in the show, according to the company which makes it. 
“I saw the studycube on ‘SKY Castle’ and bought it of my own will to create a suitable studying environment for me,” said 16-year-old Lee Do-gyeong, who is hoping to be accepted to one of Seoul’s top veterinary medicine programs. 
Demand for specialized university entrance coaches has also increased, after the show depicted a university admissions coordinator going beyond school records to guide everything from sleeping patterns to friendships. 
Lee Man-ki, director of Uway Institute of Educational Evolution, plans to increase the number of courses for aspiring college prep consultants by 50 percent. 
All of this runs contrary to what the show’s creators intended, “SKY Castle” chief producer Kim Ji-youn told Reuters. 
“This news of a flood of orders for studycube or people eagerly searching for study coordinators are what the script writer wanted to avoid the most,” she said. 
“The script writer, who also went through her child’s university admissions process, wanted to give the audience awareness of excessive education fever.” 
READING IN THE TOILET 
Studycubes sparked debate when they first appeared in South Korea seven years ago, and their appearance in “SKY Castle” led to fresh questions over the country’s high-pressure education culture. 
Lee Do-gyeong, the high school student, said she was looking forward to studying in cube’s sound-proof seclusion, but she acknowledged that if parents forced their children to use the room it could be “nothing more than a rice chest,” a reference to an infamous incident where an 18th Century Korean prince was locked away in a rice chest to die. 
Choi Ki-ju, the chief executive officer of studycube maker EMOK, said seclusion can help students focus without distractions. 
One customer compared using the studycube to reading in the toilet, Choi said. 
“This is simply accurate, don’t we concentrate better when we read books in the toilet?” he said. 
“LIFE WILL GET EASIER” 
The sense of competition in South Korea has only intensified amid one of the worst job slumps in years. 
The 97,000 jobs added in 2018 was less than one-third the number created the year before, and marks the worst performance since 2009, according to data from Statistics Korea. 
“As there are fewer jobs, intensifying competition to secure those seems to be appearing in the college prep process,” said Kim Jung-woo, an economist at the Korea Labor Institute. 
“The widespread perception among Korean society that people can work only if they graduate university is the fundamental cause of this excessive education fever.” 
On top of high school classes that run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., many children in South Korea stay at school for hours of self-learning everyday. Some take classes in private academies called “hagwon” until late at night, including weekends and even holidays, in a bid to get into the best schools and universities. 
According to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 23 percent of South Korean students reported studying more than 60 hours per week, nearly double the OECD average of 13 percent. 
South Korea’s expenditure on educational institutions is around 5.8 percent of the country’s GDP, one of the highest among OECD countries, and nearly half of tertiary education expenditure is funded by households, compared with an OECD average of 22 percent, the report added. 
Three-quarters of students said they expect to complete university education, above the OECD average of 44 percent. 
South Korea’s education ministry in late January announced a plan to promote employment of high school graduates, saying the prevailing perception of university enrolment as the only way to success has created excessive competition and an overheated private education industry. 
The ministry wants to reach a 60 percent employment rate of vocational high school students by 2022, aiming to reduce unemployment of college graduates as well as labor shortages in smaller businesses that university graduates turn their noses up at. 
Pressure at school and worries about jobs are seen as major contributors to South Korea’s high youth suicide rate. 
According to Statistics Korea, 31 percent of total deaths of children aged 10-19 are from suicide, the biggest cause of death among the age group. 
The Institute for Social Development Studies’ Research has reported that 40 percent of South Korean high school students who were particularly concerned with their grades have experienced suicidal impulses, while the country’s children and teenagers’ life satisfaction is the lowest among the OECD. 
Still, for many seeking a better life in South Korea’s cutthroat economy, the top universities are still seen as the best bet. 
“Even though (“SKY Castle”) may be extreme, it is still worth it to enter the top universities,” said Kwon Seung-ok, a mother who said the show inspired her to hire a university consultant for her daughter ahead of entrance exams this year. 
“That will lead to better opportunities and better employment. Life will definitely get easier.”

COLUMBIA, S.C. Charges are expected Friday against two South Carolina law enforcement officers that were transporting two mental patients who drowned while locked in the back of a van during Hurricane Florence, according to a prosecutor's statements to several media outlets.
Stephen Flood will be charged with two counts each of reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter, Solicitor Ed Clements told news outlets late Thursday. Joshua Bishop will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, he said.
Flood and Bishop were fired from the Horry County Sheriff's Office in October as part of an internal investigation. Authorities said the two deputies were driving 45-year-old Wendy Newton and 43-year-old Nicolette Green through Marion County to a mental-health facility as part of a court order when their van was swept away by rising floodwaters caused by torrential rains brought to the state by Hurricane Florence.
The powerful tropical system smashed into the Southeast coast as a hurricane Sept. 14, triggering severe flooding as it weakened yet nearly stalled over the Carolinas for days.
Nicolette Green
Green and Newton drowned in the back of the locked van on Sept. 18. Horry County officials have said that the deputies tried unsuccessfully to rescue the women from the van, which was on its side, blocking the door the deputies would have needed to unlock with a key. When rescue crews finally arrived, the van was underwater, and the deputies were plucked from its roof.
Many roads in the northeastern part of the state were flooded out and blocked off in the days following the powerful storm. Authorities with the sheriff's department have said that the deputies, in a marked sheriff's department vehicle, were waved through a barricade near the Little Pee Dee River by National Guardsmen charged with keeping motorists out of the area.
The Little Pee Dee was one of several rivers officials watched closely in the days following the storm.
In the months since, a legislative committee has opened hearings into the incident, discussing potential changes to the laws on how patients who are committed to mental hospitals are handled by police.","Stephen Flood will be charged with two counts each of reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter, Solicitor Ed Clements told news outlets late Thursday.",2019-01-04T02:40:00Z,Officers transporting patients who drowned in Hurricane Florence to be charged,NBC News,0
"(CNN)President Donald Trump's frustration with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is ratcheting up further after markets suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever despite Mnuchin's attempts to calm Wall Street, according to a source close to the White House.
The source told CNN that Mnuchin could be in ""serious jeopardy"" with Trump, who regularly rages at Cabinet members he feels have made mistakes, before he cools off.
Trump nevertheless vouched for Mnuchin publicly, shifting blame for the market volatility to the Federal Reserve instead.
""Yes, I do,"" Trump said Tuesday when asked whether he had confidence in Mnuchin. ""Very talented, very smart person.""
But the source painted a different picture of Mnuchin's standing behind the scenes.
""Mnuchin is under the gun,"" the source said. 
The Treasury secretary left Washington for a Christmas holiday in Mexico's Cabo San Lucas as the federal government shut down over the weekend, while Trump canceled his own planned trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and remained cooped up in the White House over the holiday, absorbing a flood of negative news about the markets.
Mnuchin aides have been scrambling to find economic data to help their boss calm Trump down, but Trump was said to be unhappy with what Mnuchin was telling him, this source said.
An administration source dismissed the latest round of rumors that the secretary's continued tenure was on the line.
""This is nonsense,"" they said.
Over the weekend, the secretary spoke by phone with the President several times, including after a brutal trading day on Christmas Eve resulting in a 653-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to the administration source. The two men spoke on a variety of issues, including the government shutdown and an update on the status of trade talks.
Mnuchin, a former investment banker and film financier, has long been one of Trump's closest advisers, dating back to his time working with Trump on the 2016 presidential campaign. Still, sources have previously told CNN that Trump was upset with Mnuchin over his advice to appoint Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman. Trump has criticized Powell and the Fed for increasing interest rates, subjecting Powell to the kind of scathing public critique that is common for senior Trump appointees but which threatens the political independence of the worlds most powerful central bank.
Wall Street has been exceptionally volatile all December, with investors already jumpy about signs of a global slowdown repeatedly spooked by Trump's own comments. The slide started in earnest with the President's own tweets following his announcement of a trade deal with Beijing, in which he suggested he may yet impose radically higher tariffs if he's not happy with negotiations.
Mnuchin turned heads in Washington and Wall Street with his attempts to calm the markets over the weekend in an attempt to head off a plunge.
Mnuchin tweeted on Saturday that he had spoken with Trump and issued a quote that he attributed to the President denying Trump had suggested firing Powell. Two sources previously told CNN that Trump had begun polling advisers on whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.
Mnuchin then spoke with the heads of major US banks on Sunday and issued a statement that evening saying the banks had ""ample liquidity."" 
But his efforts to calm markets that have been volatile for weeks appeared to fail on Monday. 
The Dow dropped by 2.9% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.7%, the biggest drops ever for the two indexes on Christmas Eve. That same day, Trump fired off a series of tweets, including one attacking the Federal Reserve. 
On Christmas Day, Trump said he remained confident in Mnuchin but was still unhappy with the Fed. 
""They're raising interest rates too fast,"" Trump said of the central bank.

"(Reuters) - The flooding that devastated the U.S. Midwest is likely to last into next week, as rain and melted snow flow into Kansas, Missouri and Mississippi, the National Weather Service said. 
Floods driven by melting snow in the Dakotas will persist even as Nebraska and Iowa dig out from storms that have killed four people, left one missing and caused more than a billion dollars in damage to crops, livestock and roads. 
“It’s already not looking good downstream for the middle and lower Mississippi and Missouri (rivers) into Kansas, Mississippi and Missouri,” Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center, said early Wednesday. 
The floodwaters have inundated a swath of Iowa and Nebraska along the Missouri River, North America’s longest river. Half of Iowa’s 99 counties have declared states of emergency. 
“That snow pack is still there and it’s going to keep melting, and that’s bad news,” Oravec said. 
About an inch of rain is predicted for Saturday in the region, Oravec said. “It’s not a lot, but any precipitation is bad right now.” 
Vice President Mike Pence toured some of Nebraska Tuesday and promised to help expedite federal help to the region. 
Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin and Mississippi all declared states of emergency after the floods, which stemmed from a powerful winter hurricane last week. The flooding killed livestock, destroyed grains and soybeans in storage and cut off access to farms because of road and rail damage. 
Authorities said they had rescued nearly 300 people in Nebraska alone, with some rivers continuing to rise. Rescuers could be seen in boats pulling pets from flooded homes. Some roadways crumbled to rubble and sections of others were submerged. In Hamburg, Iowa, floodwaters covered buildings. 
$1 BILLION IN DAMAGE 
Nebraska officials estimated flood damage for the state’s agriculture at more than $1 billion so far, according to Craig Head, vice president of issue management at the Nebraska Farm Bureau. Head said that was likely to grow as floodwaters recede. 
“It’s really too early to know for sure how bad this is going to get. But one thing we do know: It’s catastrophic for farmers,” said Matt Perdue, government relations director for the National Farmers Union. “We’re hoping it’s only $1 billion, but that’s only a hope.” 
Nebraska officials estimate the floods have also caused $553 million in damage to public infrastructure and other assets, and $89 million to privately owned assets, according to the state’s Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday. 
The water covered about a third of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, home to the U.S. Strategic Command, whose responsibilities include defending against and responding to nuclear attacks.

The Army Corps of Engineers is distributing 400,000 sandbags to operators of 12 levees along the Missouri River in Missouri and Kansas that are threatened by flooding, the Army Corps said in a news release on Tuesday. 
Roads leading to the Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper nuclear plant near Brownville were engulfed by floodwaters from the Missouri, but the facility was still operating safely at full power on Tuesday. 
The plant operator was flying staff members and supplies to the plant by helicopter, power district spokesman Mark Becker said.

"The president has long insisted that there is a security and humanitarian crisis at the border with Mexico, an assertion that was undercut by Mr. Trump himself when he acknowledged that he could have waited to issue his declaration.
Democrats seized on those words and cited government data that shows there has been no flood of criminal migrants coming into the country. Some Republicans shared that view.
But others said they opposed the president on the grounds that it was the duty of Congress to appropriate taxpayer dollars and that Mr. Trump had exceeded his authority. On Thursday, a dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats in voting to overturn Mr. Trumps emergency declaration, in a 59-to-41 vote.
Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said after the vote on Thursday.

Mr. Trump has held broad sway over congressional Republicans in his first two years in office.

"Purdue Pharma and the state of Oklahoma have agreed to settle a lawsuit over the drugmakers role in the deadly opioid crisis, a milestone in the legal effort to force pharmaceutical companies to pay some of the costs of the epidemic, people familiar with the matter said.
The deal, which is scheduled to be announced at a news conference Tuesday, will require Purdue and the family that owns the company to pay approximately $270 million. Most of the money will fund a new center for research, education and treatment of addiction and pain at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa.
Oklahoma is free to continue its lawsuit against two other defendants and their subsidiaries Johnson &amp; Johnson, the 37th-largest company in the United States, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, an Israel-based manufacturer that focuses mainly on generic drugs. The two companies, which have asked to be tried separately from Purdue, are slated to go to trial on May 28.
Lawyers in the case and a spokesman for Purdue declined to comment ahead of the planned announcement Tuesday.
[Oklahoma could provide first test of who will pay for the opioid crisis and how much]
Oklahoma contends that Purdue, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Teva bear some responsibility for thousands of opioid deaths across the state, in addition to the health care, law enforcement and treatment costs of the states addiction crisis. Purdue and others face similar claims in several other courts, and the first major settlement in the flood of lawsuits could help set the bar for compensation sought by hundreds of states, cities, counties and Native American tribes for the costs incurred in responding to the epidemic.
About 1,600 of those cases are consolidated in one enormous case known as multidistrict litigation before a federal judge in Cleveland. That action targets companies that manufactured, distributed and dispensed narcotic painkillers across the country, and those cities, towns and tribes are seeking damages in what some believe is the most complex litigation in U.S. history.
Thirty-six states have chosen to bring separate lawsuits in their own court systems, believing they have better chances there.
Purdues recent acknowledgment that it is considering bankruptcy as an option could influence strategy in those lawsuits; Oklahomas settlement ensures it will receive at least some compensation for its claims.
[Purdue Pharma CEO says bankruptcy is an option as company faces opioid lawsuits]
Under the terms of the settlement, Purdue will contribute $102.5 million to establish the new addiction center, and members of the Sackler family, who own the company, will pay another $75 million in personal funds over five years, people familiar with the agreement said. Purdue also will provide $20 million worth of treatment drugs, will pay $12 million to cities and towns, and will cover about $60 million in pay to private attorneys from two law firms that have represented Oklahoma in the case.
The addiction center would be housed at Oklahoma State Universitys Center for Wellness and Recovery and would be overseen by an independent board.
Nearly 400,000 people in the United States died of opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including a record 47,600 in 2017. Purdue is widely blamed for helping to start the epidemic after it introduced the powerful opioid OxyContin to the market in 1996. The company allegedly persuaded doctors to prescribe and overprescribe the drug for a wide variety of ailments. In 2007, Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to misconduct in their marketing of OxyContin and paid more $600 million in fines.
Authorities have argued that Purdue used deceptive marketing tactics and a sizable workforce of representatives to repeatedly visit physicians to sell them narcotics, assuring them that the drugs were rarely addictive. Many patients became addicted to the potent painkillers, and large amounts of the drug were diverted to the black market.
More than 2 million Americans now suffer from an opioid use disorder, according to government data. The epidemic has evolved to encompass illicit use of fentanyl, a synthetic ultrapowerful opioid that has caused a spike in overdoses and fatalities.
[The fentanyl failure: Obama administration did not take extraordinary measures to confront extraordinary crisis]
Three years ago, the CDC estimated the cost of the opioid epidemic at $78.5 billion for calendar year 2013. In 2017, the White House Council of Economic Advisers placed the price tag much higher, at $504 billion for 2015.
A consultants report that Oklahoma filed in court estimated that abating the opioid crisis in that state would cost more than $8.7 billion during the next 20 years.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter sued the three drug companies in June 2017, and the two sides have been taking depositions and jousting over pretrial issues for nearly two years. As other cases lagged, Oklahoma judge Thad H. Balkman set a May 28 trial date, agreed to televise the proceedings live and refused drug company requests to postpone the trial. That ensured that the Oklahoma case would be the first major test of whether the companies would be forced to pay for the crisis.
According to a lawsuit filed by the state of Massachusetts, Sackler family members received nearly $4.3 billion in payouts from Purdue between 2008 and 2016. But the family-owned company has suffered heavy blows to its image in recent months as litigation has advanced. Three museums in Britain and the United States have turned down donations from the Sacklers, longtime patrons of the arts, in recent days.
And documents released in the Massachusetts lawsuit, brought by state Attorney General Maura Healey, depicted some of the Sacklers as insatiably greedy and uncaring about the human toll of their product.
Millions of dollars were not enough. They wanted billions, the lawsuit charges. They cared more about money than about patients, or their employees, or the truth.

"Where does George Soros find the time? To hear the loon-o-sphere tell it, the Hungarian-born liberal Jewish billionaire, at the ripe old age of 88, has been exceedingly industrious. He dismantled the Soviet Union, launched coups in four Eastern European countries and a revolution in a fifth, while also destroying the Malaysian economy and financing Halliburton. He caused the 2008 global financial crisis, bought the presidency for Barack Obama, wrote the 2009 stimulus and served as puppetmaster for Hillary Clinton. He organized the Ferguson, Mo., protests, the 2016 post-election protests, the Womens March, the March for Science, the Parkland, Fla., gun-control protests, the anti-Kavanaugh protests, the NFL national anthem protests, the migrant caravan and also, paradoxically, the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville. He controls the State Department, the Democratic Party and the union movement and is financing a Purple Revolution to overthrow President Trump, as well as efforts to break up the euro zone, depose the Turkish president and destroy Facebook. In his free time, Soros supports terrorists, illegal drugs, tax evasion, censorship, communists, one-world government, open borders, euthanasia, North Korea and Iran. A Nazi collaborator as a child, he currently serves as the anti-Christ. In ordinary times, all but the most deranged Alex Jones listener would recognize the above as wackadoodle, tied together by a common libel used against Jews for centuries: the clandestine manipulation of events. But these are not ordinary times, and Trump and his advisers are not only endorsing the conspiracy theories but also assigning a whole new portfolio of world-domination responsibilities to Soros as if he didnt already have enough on his plate. Trump, in his closing ad of the 2016 campaign, featured Soros and two other American Jews as part of a global power structure acting in cahoots with Clinton against America. More recently, he suggested that the Brett M. Kavanaugh protesters were paid for by Soros, and said he wouldnt be surprised if Soros were behind the caravan. A lot of people say yes. Donald Trump Jr. has echoed the Nazi-collaborator slander and the Ferguson allegation, and Rudy Giuliani circulated the anti-Christ idea. A consequence: Soros was one of the attempted targets of a Trump fan in Florida who sent pipe bombs to the presidents critics, and the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre had posted online about Soros controlling the caravan, as Trump had suggested. There are those including the president of the United States who rail against globalists that are ruining the country, a term popularized by the alt-right who regularly use it as a euphemism for Jews, Anti-Defamation League chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said at the groups annual summit Monday. During this past election, there were television ads run by mainstream political candidates and parties that shamefully portrayed the Jewish philanthropist George Soros, casting him as a grotesque caricature pulled right from the pages of the Protocols of Zion responsible for all the worlds ills. Last week, The Posts Felicia Sonmez reported that the director of the U.S. Agency for Global Media apologized to Soros last month for a taxpayer-financed program the agency aired describing Soros as a nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals. The program claimed he was involved in clandestine operations that led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union and described him as the architect of the financial collapse of 2008. On Monday, even as the ADL was decrying the Protocols-of-Zion style attacks on Soros, the Trump administration was enabling such attacks. As The Posts Griff Witte reported, Hungarys autocratic leader Viktor Orban who has engaged in an ugly anti-Semitic campaign against Soros succeeded in forcing the Soros-founded Central European University, a top institution, to leave the country. Incredibly, U.S. Ambassador David B. Cornstein, a jeweler and longtime Trump pal, admitted he tried neither incentives nor threats to sway his friend Orban. Cornstein instead blamed the universitys founder Soros for the schools departure and refused to criticize Orban, Witte reported. As part of Orbans persecution of Soros whose Open Society Foundation has championed democratic institutions in Eastern Europe the Hungarian government put up billboards last year (many soon covered in anti-Semitic graffiti) that evoked Nazi propaganda. The government, falsely claiming Soros wanted to flood Hungary with illegal immigrants, pushed a Stop Soros law targeting non-governmental organizations and passed legislation targeting what it called the Soros university. The university has bipartisan support in Washington, and Cornstein (who said during his confirmation that he was a proud American Jew concerned about Hungarys anti-Semitism) promised to protect it. But Trumps man did no such thing. Instead, he said he saw no problems with human rights in Hungary and claimed evicting the university doesnt have anything to do with academic freedom. The fault, Trumps man said, is Soross. Isnt it always?

"LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In Frankfurt and Paris, the flood of banking jobs predicted to arrive after Brexit is, for now, little more than a trickle. 
An analysis of job postings on eight of the world’s major investment bank websites show a modest push to recruit staff in other European cities but little to suggest London is set for a rapid demise as the region’s top banking hub. 
Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are seeking to fill 1,545 new roles in Britain, numbers up to January 22 show. 
In Germany and France - the two countries predicted to see the biggest influx of financial services from Britain as a result of Brexit - just 301 roles have been listed. 
Only Deutsche Bank is looking to hire more people in Germany than in Britain, with 133 German vacancies posted online compared to 132 in the UK. 
“It isn’t really a tsunami of hires,” said Christine Kuhl, a partner with executive placement firm Odgers Berndtson in Frankfurt. 
The figures do not capture numbers of existing employees who might relocate from London to other EU offices under contingency plans following Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) or roles that are not publicly advertised. 
But they are forward-looking indicators of how each bank is looking to remodel their European workforce over the coming months in the face of Brexit, and suggest banks are only making modest tweaks as Britain’s EU departure approaches on March 29. 
“Culturally, Paris is French, Frankfurt is German but London is international. The Americans - who own this industry - want to operate in an English speaking environment. No one wants to go,” said Martin Armstrong, partner at headhunting firm Armstrong International. 
Other recruitment specialists reported few signs of banks preparing to bulk up in a hurry, even if Britain has to leave the EU without a deal covering financial services. 
The small number of moves to date have followed many months of consultations and negotiations, the headhunters said, with banks keen to avoid relocations which might prove premature or even unnecessary. 
“It can be done, but we are talking months, possibly longer if there are families involved,” said James Murray, a director at search firm Robert Walters. 
“That said, if risk takers do start to move elsewhere than that is where we could start to see real movement in terms of jobs. When the risk takers move, then surely the risk managers move, and so on,” he added. 
HOMEWORK 
Search firm Korn Ferry set up a Brexit task force after Britons voted in 2016 to leave the EU and met regularly to prepare for a mass transfer of talent from London to Frankfurt. But the influx hasn’t happened. 
One senior banker who is making the move to Frankfurt is Christoph Seibel. Seibel, a German national, left the city in 1993 to go to business school in the United States and then pursue a career in London. 
Mizuho poached him from RBC Capital Markets in London to become CEO of the bank’s newly headquartered EU operations in Frankfurt. He takes up the new post on March 28. 
Mizuho is one of 45 financial firms that Germany’s financial regulator Bafin says are setting up Frankfurt hubs after Brexit. 
But moves like Seibel’s are few and far between, with activity to date well short of the 6,000 financial jobs lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance previously expected to move to Germany’s largest financial hub in the event of a hard Brexit. 
Seven leading executive search firms contacted by Reuters reported few offerings for leadership roles in Frankfurt as uncertainty about Britain’s future trading relationship with the bloc continues. 
Some banks are nevertheless betting on London to retain the balance of power over rival centers in the EU, opting to base top executives and keep their European headquarters in London - for the time being at least. 
Citi’s new EMEA Chief Executive David Livingstone will be based in the UK capital, as will HSBC’s newly appointed global markets boss Georges Elhedery, who will relocate from Dubai to London to take up the job two weeks before Brexit. 
Goldman Sachs has recently expanded the role of London-based Richard Gnodde to head of the bank’s international operations while Morgan Stanley has appointed Clare Woodman to head up its EMEA business - also from London. 
(Graphic: Britain still top spot for investment banking job ads - tmsnrt.rs/2TjKgsg) 
FAST-TRACK 
For now at least, head hunters say London is winning the war to retain its talent, undermining Germany’s ‘Bankfurt’ ambitions or President Emmanuel Macron’s push to swell the Paris finance industry at London’s expense. 
Goldman Sachs for example, which is making Frankfurt its EU hub after Brexit, is looking for just 15 roles in Germany’s financial center with most of them in compliance, tax, legal, risk management or operations. 
By contrast, the bank has 190 jobs advertised in Britain including I.T., compliance, human resources, as well as corporate &amp; investment banking roles. 
And with the market for permanent roles seen in rude health, persuading London-based bankers to move is no easy task, with handsome pay packages and better promotion prospects central to the negotiations. 
“People say: ‘talk to me about jobs in Asia first, then Dublin, then Frankfurt, then Paris’ in that order. People want big upticks and guaranteed bonuses as standard,” Darren Burns, operations director at headhunter Morgan McKinley, said. 
“There’s a feeling if you move to Dublin as a director now, you could be managing director in three years, whereas in Frankfurt, there is already too much competition for the top roles. The local talent is already your boss or your boss’s boss.” 
As banks automate more processes to cut costs, they are also recruiting more in countries where they can hire skilled workers in areas such as technology and risk management at a fraction of the cost seen in Western financial centers. 
After Britain, the second hottest jobs market in Europe is Poland, where 878 posts are up for grabs across Warsaw, Krakow and Wroclaw. 
Citi and Credit Suisse have advertised 531 roles in Poland between them, compared with an aggregated 36 posts in Germany and 8 jobs in France. 
Morgan Stanley has 49 vacancies in Budapest, where it opened in 2006 and now employs more than 1,300 people. 
“The biggest banks have been nearshoring and offshoring roles from their most expensive centers for the best part of 15 years now, entirely unrelated to Brexit,” Murray said. 
“If they still have jobs in London, it’s because they genuinely need or want those jobs to be in London.”

"Los Angeles — A powerful winter storm unleashed mudslides in Southern California wildfire burn areas and trapped motorists on a major highway, and the northern part of the state braced for more wet weather Sunday.
Saturday's deluge loosened hillsides where a major blaze burned last year in and around Malibu, clogging the Pacific Coast Highway with mud and debris.
A stretch of the scenic route northwest of Los Angeles was expected to remain closed in both directions until Monday while crews tow away stuck vehicles and clear lanes. No injuries were reported.
The rapper Soulja Boy was among those whose cars were mired in the muck that was up to 4 feet deep in some areas.
The 28-year-old retweeted a photo of the mudslide and posted: ""My car got stuck too almost went into the ocean,"" along with a prayer emoji.

The sun emerged Sunday in Los Angeles and the red carpet for that night's Golden Globe award ceremony. Scattered showers were possible later in the night.
To the north, wind and rain forced delays or cancellations of flights out of San Francisco International Airport for a second day. A wind advisory was in place until 10 p.m. Sunday.
The San Francisco Bay Area could get up to 1 ½ inches of rain, with the heaviest downpours coming after sunset.
Strong winds and downed trees knocked out electricity for at least 20,000 customers across the Sacramento region Sunday night. The National Weather Service said Sunday that winds gusted up to 49 mph.
Saturday's storm brought about a foot of snow to the Sierra Nevada and twice that amount was expected Sunday. A winter storm warning was in effect until 4 a.m. Monday.
Avalanche warnings were posted in parts of California, Nevada and Utah. The Sierra Avalanche Center issued a backcountry avalanche warning for the Lake Tahoe area stretching south into the Sierra along the California-Nevada line from noon Sunday until 7 a.m. Monday.
The National Weather Service says blizzard conditions with gale-force winds could trigger widespread avalanche activity.

"ATLANTA (Reuters) - As football fans flood Atlanta for Sunday’s Super Bowl, not everyone is thrilled that a city once a pillar of the Civil Rights movement is playing host, given the NFL’s record on race. 
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell highlighted Atlanta’s history of racial activism in comments to reporters this week and said the National Football League, where 70 percent of players are African American, was devoted to “honoring that legacy.” 
But he also denied an allegation by former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick that NFL owners have conspired to keep him off the field since his kneeling protest against racial inequality in 2016 drew the ire of some fans and U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Kaepernick has not been able to find work in the league since then. Goodell said any team which thought Kaepernick could help them win would hire the quarterback, who led the 49ers to the 2013 Super Bowl. 
“We know that blackballs exist and we believe that this is one of them,” Richard Rose, president of the Atlanta NAACP, told Reuters at a social justice rally on Saturday in Atlanta’s Piedmont Park. 
“For the longest time the NFL would not hire any black quarterbacks so this is just a continuation of that,” he said. “Let’s be real about it...It’s just punishment again for trying to stand up as a person of color.” 
 The NFL did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Despite an NFL rule requiring teams to interview at least one minority candidate for open coaching positions, only one person of color is expected to fill one of the eight head-coaching vacancies during the next hiring cycle, according to ESPN’s The Undefeated web site. 
That is a failure by the NFL to seek out minority coaches, said Curtis Carmichael, an NAACP volunteer. 
He said there are talented coaches even at the high school level in minority communities who never get the opportunity to develop into NFL head coaches. 
“You have to actually be collaborating with these communities,” he said. 
Tanya Washington, an Atlanta law professor and activist, said the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr. should focus on making life better for its poor and minority citizens, instead of catering to wealthy out-of-town visitors. 
The game on Sunday between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams represented “a distortion of priorities,” she told Reuters at the rally. 
“You don’t have a big expensive party when you can’t afford to house your citizens,” she said of Atlanta, which has about 2,700 homeless people, according to local advocacy groups. 
“Our civic identity is civil rights and being an inclusive community and this is how we act?” she said. “It happens everywhere but it hits a different tone in Atlanta than it would somewhere else that doesn’t have that legacy.”

"Four decades after Three Mile Island became shorthand for America’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, there is a push to keep it open, according to reports.
NPR reported that concerns about climate change and the need for zero-carbon power are some of the factors behind the push.
MISSOURI MAN WHO TOPPLED MORE THAN 100 HEADSTONES AT JEWISH CEMETERY GETS PROBATION
“We’re at a point where if nuclear retires immediately, we would probably replace it with natural gas generation because we haven’t sufficiently planned to replace it with something cleaner,” Mark Szybist, a senior attorney with Natural Resources Defense Council, said.
The nation’s aging and shrinking nuclear power fleet is being buffeted by a flood of natural gas plants entering competitive electricity markets, relatively flat post-recession electricity demand, and states putting more emphasis on renewable energy and efficiency.
The pursuit of state guarantees has spurred questions over why ratepayers should foot the cost to keep nuclear power plants open, and whether nuclear power provides an indispensable environmental benefit in the age of global warming.
The spotlight moved in 2017 to Pennsylvania, the nation’s No. 2 nuclear power state.
That’s when Three Mile Island’s owner, Chicago-based Exelon Corp., announced it will close the plant that was the site of a terrifying partial meltdown in 1979 unless Pennsylvania comes to its financial rescue. It set this Sept. 30 as the closing date.
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp. also said it will shut down its Beaver Valley nuclear power plant in western Pennsylvania — as well as two nuclear plants in Ohio — within three years unless Pennsylvania steps up.
So far, no rescue has been written into legislation.

Republican state Rep. Thomas Mehaffie recently introduced a bill, NPR reported, to try to keep the Pennsylvania plants open.
“If we lose one or more of these plants we might as well forget about all the time and money we’ve invested in wind and solar,” Mehaffie said.
Exelon said Pennsylvania must enact legislation by June 1 if it is to keep operating Three Mile Island, since fuel must be ordered months in advance.

"WASHINGTON (AP) Special counsel Robert Mueller closed his long and contentious Russia investigation with no new charges, ending the probe that has cast a dark shadow over Donald Trumps presidency. The Justice Department was expected to release the main findings as soon as Saturday.
Even with the details still under wraps, the end Friday of the 22-month probe without additional indictments by Mueller was welcome news to some in Trumps orbit who had feared a final round of charges could ensnare more Trump associates, including members of the presidents family.
For now, the report is accessible to only a handful of Justice Department officials while Attorney General William Barr prepared to release the principal findings soon.
The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr. Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats demands that it be quickly released to the public and Republicans contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
The next step is up to Barr, who is charged with writing his own account of Muellers findings and sending it to Congress. In a letter to lawmakers, he declared he was committed to transparency and speed. He said he could provide details as soon as this weekend.
The White House sought to keep some distance from the report, saying it had not seen or been briefed on the document. Trump, surrounded by advisers and political supporters at his resort in Florida, stayed uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter.
With no details released at this point, its not known whether Muellers report answers the core questions of his investigation: Did Trumps campaign collude with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of the celebrity businessman? Also, did Trump take steps later, including by firing his FBI director, to obstruct the probe?
But the delivery of the report does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia, or of obstruction by the president. A Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller was not recommending any further indictments.
That person, who described the document as comprehensive, was not authorized to discuss the probe and asked for anonymity.
Thats good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing. They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Muellers prosecutors. It wasnt immediately clear whether Mueller might have referred additional investigations to the Justice Department.
All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the presidents former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies. Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet. Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
Its unclear what steps Mueller might take if he uncovered what he believes to be criminal wrongdoing by Trump, in light of Justice Department legal opinions that have held that sitting presidents may not be indicted.
In his letter to lawmakers, Barr noted the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to ensure there was no political inference. Trump was never interviewed in person, but submitted answers to questions in writing.
The mere delivery of the confidential findings set off swift, full-throated demands from Democrats for full release of Muellers report and the supporting evidence collected during the sweeping probe. As Muellers probe has wound down, Democrats have increasingly shifted their focus to their own investigations, ensuring the special counsels would not be the last word on the matter.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it imperative to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
The American people have a right to the truth, Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a sneak preview of the findings.
The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public, they said in a joint statement.
It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Muellers findings. Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying we look forward to the process taking its course. But Trumps personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get an early look before they were made public.
Giuliani said it was appropriate for the White House to be able to review matters of executive privilege. He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front. He later softened his stance, saying the decision was up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly.
The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the reports arrival Friday. Barrs chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood on Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.
The chairman of the Senate panel, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was keynote speaker Friday night at a Palm Beach County GOP dinner at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort. Early in the evening, the president appeared on a balcony to wave at the crowd of more than 600 enjoying cocktails and appetizers by the pool, according to party vice-chairwoman Tami Donnally, who attended the event.
Barr has said he wants to make as much public as possible, but any efforts to withhold details is sure to prompt a tussle between the Justice Department and lawmakers who may subpoena Mueller and his investigators to testify before Congress. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., threatened a subpoena Friday.
Such a move would likely be vigorously contested by the Trump administration.
The conclusion of Muellers investigation does not remove legal peril for the president. Trump faces a separate Justice Department investigation in New York into hush money payments during the campaign to two women who say they had sex with him years before the election. Hes also been implicated in a potential campaign finance violation by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who says Trump asked him to arrange the transactions. Federal prosecutors, also in New York, have been investigating foreign contributions made to the presidents inaugural committee.
No matter the findings in Muellers report, the investigation has already illuminated Russias assault on the American political system, painted the Trump campaign as eager to exploit the release of hacked Democratic emails and exposed lies by Trump aides aimed at covering up their Russia-related contacts.
The special counsel brought a sweeping indictment accusing Russian military intelligence officers of hacking Democrat Hillary Clintons campaign and other Democratic groups during the 2016 campaign. He charged another group of Russians with carrying out a large-scale social media disinformation campaign against the American political process that also sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton.
Mueller also initiated the investigation into Cohen, who pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations arising from the hush money payments and in the Mueller probe to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal. Another Trump confidant, Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails ultimately released by WikiLeaks.
Mueller has also been investigating whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation. Since the special counsels appointment in May 2017, Trump has increasingly tried to undermine the probe by calling it a witch hunt and repeatedly proclaiming there was NO COLLUSION with Russia.
But one week before Muellers appointment, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, later saying he was thinking of this Russia thing at the time.

"(Repeats story published late on Monday, no changes to text) * Higher interest rates and fuel pressure airlines, lessors * Airline industry still profitable but heavily skewed to U.S. * Aircraft finance established as new alternative asset class * New money pushes down returns, smaller entrants seen vulnerable By Anshuman Daga and Tim Hepher HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - An unprecedented boom in the $280 billion aircraft finance industry is showing signs of faltering as rising interest rates, cut-rate competition and higher oil prices trigger a shakeout in a sector that has attracted a flood of Chinese funding. Conferences in Hong Kong last week saw more than 1,000 financiers, lawyers and airline bosses talk up the fundamentals of an industry that has emerged as a flourishing asset class globally, but in contrast to previous years the mood was one of subdued optimism even as corks popped on new deals. Concerns about central bank tightening, trade rows and currency swings could blow some froth, they cautioned. “I think the party is over in terms of lower interest rates,” said Robert Martin, CEO of Asia’s largest-listed aircraft lessor BOC Aviation. The sector veteran of three decades noted that smaller players who had not matched their funding needs to liabilities, unlike larger ones like his company, would find it difficult to ride out any volatility. The failure to do so has caused some high-profile collapses, such as Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) in the 1990s. The former GPA executives who now dominate the industry say the sector has matured and is backed by diversified sources of funding as aviation finance sits proudly alongside property and infrastructure as alternatives to traditional market bets. Yet danger signals have emerged, such as stronger dollar hitting the coffers of many airlines just as they must adjust to a spike in oil prices. That could land unwanted aircraft back into the laps of lessors needing to find new takers. In a sign of turbulence ahead, global airlines have already slashed profit forecasts due to high oil prices. A few leasing companies are also quietly giving airlines rental ‘holidays’ to help their cash flows, sources said. And some airlines are increasing traffic only by cutting prices, which will hurt all but those with the lowest costs, said Rob Morris, chief consultant at Flight Ascend. According to Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of asset managers IBA: “The market is poised for the start of a correction. There are too many signals.” “When airlines feel pain, lessors feel pain.” DEALS DRIVE DOWN YIELDS The industry, however, remains in better shape than in previous cycles, driven by consolidation in the United States. Airlines have begun to recoup their costs of capital in the past four years after decades of value destruction, according to the International Air Transport Association. Demand for financing for new commercial aircraft deliveries is expected to rise almost 7 percent this year to $139 billion, Boeing has said. Last week, financiers were busy doing deals overlooking Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour at conferences hosted by Airline Economics and Euromoney’s Airfinance Journal. Lessors say liquidity is abundant and that financial strains in one part of the globe can be offset by demand elsewhere. Currently, Chinese capital accounts for about 30 percent of the funding deployed by leasing firms worldwide, up from 5 percent about nine years ago. But while the carousel continues, the flood of new money chasing deals has lowered returns for most in the industry. Goshawk Aviation, a venture of Hong Kong conglomerate NWS Holdings and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, says the sector’s low yields are not feasible for long. Brian Cheng, executive director at NWS that bought Dublin-based Sky Aviation Leasing this year, said he had seen funding bids from companies that are prepared to accept returns of 3-5 percent on their aircraft investments. “Insurance companies or banks can achieve (these rates) because their borrowing costs are so low... but for us there’s no way to compete with that.” “SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE” Against that backdrop, opportunistic M&amp;A is also picking up. Japan’s Orix Corp struck a $2.2 billion deal this year for a 30 percent stake in leasing firm Avolon Holdings. SMBC Aviation Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking’s leasing arm, expects to receive an extra $1 billion from shareholders in a couple of months, Peter Barrett, CEO of the world’s No. 5 lessor said. But with air pockets in sight, industry executives increasingly point to an expected shakeout among smaller lessors. Some smaller Chinese players are already pulling back. “It’s like driving a car on the expressway. Everybody is on the gas pedal right now. No one is going to the gas station or taking a break. Everybody is full throttle but something has got to give. Some cars will just head off to the exit,” Cheng said.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Companies and factories in England will have a legal obligation to foot the bill for the disposal or recycling of waste packaging they produce under new plans by Britain’s environment minister. Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042 as a growing flood of plastic endangers life in the world’s oceans. “We can move away from being a ‘throw-away’ society, to one that looks at waste as a valuable resource,” Michael Gove, minister for the Department of the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), said in a statement on the proposed overhaul to England’s waste system. “We will cut our reliance on single-use plastics, end confusion over household recycling, tackle the problem of packaging by making polluters pay, and end the economic, environmental and moral scandal that is food waste.” Producers of items that are harder to recycle, such as cars and batteries, will have to take more responsibility for what they produce, while a byzantine system for household recycling will be simplified in a bid to boost recycling rates. The proposals only affect England as environmental policy is devolved to regional assemblies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The issue of single-use plastics has become more salient this year after China cracked down on imports of plastic trash, leading the U.N. environment chief to call on developed nations to re-think their use of plastics. In October, finance minister Philip Hammond announced a tax on plastic packaging which does not meet a threshold of at least 30 percent recycled content from April 2022. Britain also wants to tackle food waste. Supermarkets and other food businesses will have to report annual food surplus and government may consult on mandatory targets to prevent food waste if no more progress is made. “Our priority is to stop surplus food from becoming waste... Ideally, surplus food should be redistributed for people to eat,” Gove’s strategy paper said.

"White House officials on Wednesday asked federal agencies to send them a list of stalled services they would like to resume to minimize the public impact of the federal shutdown, three people familiar with the directive said.
The message, conveyed during a conference call between top officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies, is part of a broader effort to keep large parts of the federal government running while President Trump digs in for a lengthy battle over a border wall.
The Trump administration is directing federal employees, in many cases without pay, to process tax refunds, extend food-stamp benefits, provide documents for mortgage processing, keep a federal flood insurance program running, and open up national parks. Many of these activities had been prohibited during past shutdowns and were shuttered during the first two weeks of the current lapse.
The rapid and in many cases unprecedented scope of OMBs directives has prompted criticism from Democrats and some Republicans that the White House is bending the rules to contain political fallout. During a funding lapse, agencies can retain certain employees to perform only essential functions that in many cases are matters of public health or national security.
It is very unusual for the White House to allow agencies to make so many changes to their contingency plans at this stage in a shutdown. The current lapse will be the longest in U.S. history if it lasts through Saturday, and White House officials said they are trying to provide maximum flexibility to blunt the impact on American families and businesses.
OMB has routinely communicated with agencies throughout the partial shutdown to ensure were taking all steps to make this as painless as possible, said Meghan Burris, an OMB spokeswoman. Unlike previous administrations, we understand this is not easy on the American people, which is why were proactively identifying ways to keep the government running while remaining consistent with law.
[The partisan warrior leading the White Houses shutdown response]
The effort by the OMB has been largely improvised and reactive, as few agencies had complete plans in place for an extended shutdown. Trump has said he will keep the government shutdown open for months, years or whatever it takes to get Democrats in Congress to sign off on $5.7 billion for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The reason you put out a plan before a shutdown starts is so that its clear these decisions are based on the law, said Sam Berger, who was an OMB lawyer in the Obama administration during a shutdown in 2013.
Keeping basic functions of government intact during the shutdown has also taken the administration into uncharted legal territory, reversing precedents as it searches for ways to fund efforts for which Congress has not appropriated any money.
As the administration pushes more and more federal employees to work without pay, some unions are launching legal challenges.
The Antideficiency Act, passed more than 100 years ago, prohibits the government from spending money that hasnt been appropriated by Congress. The law puts sharp constraints on what agencies do during a shutdown, because Congress hasnt approved specific funding.
But its sweep is open to interpretation, and there have rarely been legal challenges during a shutdown to block certain programs or benefits from taking place. Still, violating the law can lead to fines or even criminal penalties, which has for years given federal employees pause.
Though Democrats have grumbled over the legally murky moves, they have not contested them broadly. Doing so would come at considerable political risk, putting the party in the untenable position of suing the administration to block tax refunds, food stamps and other popular services.
On the Wednesday call, OMB officials said they would review any requests from the agencies to see whether there was a legal way to allow specific programs to restart. They also signaled to agency officials they would continue doing it as much as possible and as quickly as possible, said the three people briefed on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to disclose the calls contents.
The ad hoc nature of the restoration effort has left the administration with wide leeway to pick which functions are restored and which lapse along with their funding. Many agencies have scrapped or reversed key parts of their contingency plans because of blowback from businesses or interest groups, and some agencies have been slow to identify problems, in part because senior leaders left during the Christmas holiday and didnt return until last week.
The review and response process is overseen largely by a small team at the OMB, led by acting director Russell Vought and his general counsel, Mark Paoletta. Many of the requests for changes came in late in the process because some agencies didnt realize how many problems they had with their contingency plans until more than a week after the shutdown began on Dec. 22.
Last Friday, the Internal Revenue Service announced it would restart a program that provides income information for companies processing mortgage applications. On Sunday, the National Park Service brought some staff back, still with no pay, so that it could clean up areas at a number of national parks. On Monday, the White House announced the IRS would be allowed to pay tax refunds next month even if the shutdown continued, something that had previously been deemed to violate government rules. On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department said it would be able to pay food stamp benefits in February, even though it initially appeared to lack the funding to do so just a few days ago.
Collectively, these changes have served to extend government services to millions of people, even though in most cases the federal employees performing the functions will not receive any salary.
This should be a serious challenge to the congressional leadership, because this sets up a presidency, that can by whim of the OMB pick and choose and give relief where they think it needs to be, said Steve Bell, a Republican and former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.
The OMB frequently has conference calls with federal agencies, and during the current lapse it has scheduled a large-scale call with numerous agencies roughly three times a week.
It is not unprecedented for White House officials to constantly monitor the impact of a government shutdown and make changes, particularly in the face of political pressure. During a funding lapse in 2013, the Obama administration allowed World War II veterans to visit the World War II Memorial, which as a national monument had been closed off.
But the Trump administration has gone much further, and the OMB call on Wednesday suggested that more changes could come.
Bell said by continuing operations that had previously been halted because employees werent allowed to work, the White House was effectively blunting some of the public relations backlash from people who are demanding their tax refunds or food stamp benefits.","To keep a shut down government running, White House ventures into uncharted territory The Washington Post Trump’s New Shutdown World The Wall Street Journal At White House, Empty Desks and Unpaid Bills as Trump Shows No Sign of Relenting The New York Times Vi…",2019-01-11T00:58:56Z,"To keep a shut down government running, White House ventures into uncharted territory - The Washington Post",The Washington Post,0
"Washington (CNN)On the evening Robert Mueller submitted his report to the Justice Department, ending the special counsel investigation that has clouded all but a few months of his presidency, President Donald Trump was not huddled in a war room or dictating defiant tweets to his underlings.
Instead he was on the tiled patio of Mar-a-Lago, bathed in golden light, with his wife and son Barron, who had reached teenagerhood two days earlier.
In the eyes of the President and his aides, many of whom traveled to South Florida for the weekend, it was a moment to celebrate: the conclusion of an investigation that did not find enough evidence to indict the President or his confidants for conspiring with Russia to win the 2016 election. 
Whether the end of Mueller's probe means the end of Trump's long legal albatross, or just the beginning, is largely a matter for Congress and the various other prosecutors who have taken on ancillary investigations. 
Even as Mueller's team vacates the bland Washington office building where he's been working every day since May 2017, another struggle is beginning, opening a new chapter Trump will try to control but which he will write only part of the script.
Still, Trump and his allies are already signaling the report is an unequivocal victory, once that exonerates the President from the various misdeeds -- collusion, obstruction -- that his opponents have used as bywords for what they regard as a shambolic presidency.
While there was not a strict plan in place ahead of the report's conclusion, Trump and his Republican allies immediately launched an effort to cast the document as absolving him of wrongdoing. 
Talking points distributed by the Republican National Committee encouraged Trump's allies to stress that ""after two years, millions of taxpayer dollars, and multiple congressional investigations confirming there was no collusion, it's good this report has finally concluded.""
News the investigation had ended became official on Friday around 5 p.m. ET, as Trump was discussing trade and Brexit in a businesslike phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Florida club. Earlier, Emmet Flood -- the White House lawyer tasked with overseeing matters related to the Russia probe -- received a phone call from an aide to Attorney General William Barr telling him the report had been delivered to the Justice Department.
Flood, who almost never travels with the President, had decided to accompany him to Palm Beach this weekend, anticipating what all of Washington seemed to know: that Mueller was nearing the end of his investigation. He helped comprise a larger-than-usual coterie of aides who descended on the President's Italianate club. 
In the early evening, many of them were seen milling about the main floor of the estate, all waiting to learn what might be contained in Mueller's report. In the days and weeks leading up to the report, there were few planning sessions to prepare for the document, according to people familiar with the matter. While vague plans for statements and reaction were laid, West Wing staffers said there was little to indicate how the White House would respond once the investigation concluded.
""I have no idea about the Mueller report,"" Trump told reporters on Friday morning as he headed to Florida, insisting he would be keeping busy at his resort between a meeting with Caribbean leaders and various other sessions on trade. Trump himself was kept updated by his team of lawyers, whom he quizzed periodically about the status of the report over the last several weeks.
Trump himself had grown impatient with the waiting game, aides said, which dominated his beloved cable news for several days. As it became clear Mueller was nearing the end of his investigation, Trump appeared in a combative and sometimes foul mood. It was hard to separate the two things, and aides openly speculated his 50-tweet rage last weekend and his renewed attacks on Sen. John McCain were an attempt to counter-program the investigation's end.
On Friday, before the President sat down to dinner with his family at a cordoned-off table, he and his lawyer Flood were seen in easygoing conversation. Guests and aides said Trump was in a spirited mood as he was briefed on various pieces of information that were emerging from the Justice Department, including that Mueller was not recommending any further indictments. His eldest son Donald Trump Jr. -- long the subject of legal speculation -- mingled with guests, his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle by his side.
Later, he appeared on stage at an fundraiser for the Palm Beach Republicans underway in the Louis XIV-style ballroom named in his honor. Trump didn't mention the Mueller report in his remarks -- but as his close ally Sen. Lindsey Graham was calling on the FBI to investigate Hillary Clinton, Trump looked on as the crowd broke into a ""lock her up"" chant.
That could be a signal of the direction Trump and Republicans plan to head as the President launches his re-election campaign without the looming presence of the special counsel.
White House aides and those close to Trump were universally optimistic on Friday and Saturday that Mueller's report would provide a boon politically, showing the Democrats and the media had vastly overstated the implications of the ongoing probe.
""It's a great day for America,"" one Trump campaign adviser said. ""We won.""
""The fat lady has sung,"" another White House official said, adding that it's ""absolutely embarrassing"" for Democrats who have been predicting a collusion finding for two years.
Whether the report exonerates Trump or not, it has remained a persistent cloud on his presidency from the day it was announced in 2017. And it's colored the first half of the Trump presidency in ways that will forever be entwined with the country's 45th commander in chief.
He's cycled through several iterations of a legal team, each offering their own strategy, from outright cooperation to a campaign to discredit the entire operation. His current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has enjoyed a late-in-life return to political life as a tottering and sometimes wildly off-message legal guru.
After recusing himself from oversight of the Mueller prove, Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, became a punching bag, never recovering the President's trust. After more than a year of insults, he departed last year.
By Trump's own telling, the investigation had embarrassed him in front of foreign leaders, who he believed viewed him as less-than-legitimate amid questions about how he was elected.
Developments kept popping up as he traveled abroad, from the Justice Department announcement it was appointing a special counsel days before his very first foreign trip to the testimony of his former lawyer Michael Cohen that dominated headlines while he was in Vietnam attempting to broker a nuclear deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump's denunciations of the investigation will be engraved in a modern political lexicon: ""No collusion,"" ""witch hunt"" and ""hoax"" have all been uttered or tweeted so often they now stand alone as political rallying cries, devoid of context or any explanation at the President's political rallies or on his social media. 
The minutia of the investigation have become so engrained in the President's day-to-day patter, one sometimes forgets how complicated the whole thing was -- or the revelations that have been discovered as part of Mueller's probe. 
For all of Trump's talk about ""lovers"" and ""dirty cops"" and ""12 angry Democrats,"" there have been startling discoveries about the President and his circle that would not have been uncovered were it not for the special counsel's work. His former campaign chairman is serving years in prison. His national security adviser lied to investigators. And Trump himself has been implicated in a campaign finance crime involving sex with a pornographic actress.
Those discoveries have not seemed to damped Republicans' quiet glee at the comparatively benign ending to the Mueller investigation, though as of Saturday morning there were few people who could say for certain what was contained in the report.
Perhaps the best indication the White House is still holding its breath: Trump's own silence. Instead of proclaiming victory from the podium of the Donald J. Trump Ballroom on Friday evening, the President avoided the topic altogether. Instead, he let the moment speak for itself.
""Enjoy yourselves,"" he told the crowd.

"Aaron Francisco Chavez swallowed at least one of the sky blue pills at a Halloween party before falling asleep forever. He became yet another victim killed by a flood of illicit fentanyl smuggled from Mexico into the Southwest — a profitable new business for drug gangs that has pushed the synthetic opioid to the top spot for fatal U.S. overdoses.
Three others at the party in Tucson also took the pills nicknamed ""Mexican oxy"" and police flagged down by partygoers saved them by administering naloxone overdose reversal medication. But the treatment came too late for Chavez, who died at age 19.
DOES ABSINTHE REALLY MAKE DRINKERS HALLUCINATE
The four thought they were taking oxycodone, a much less powerful opioid, investigators believe. The death of Chavez and many others, officials said, illustrate how Arizona and other southwestern states bordering Mexico have become a hot spot in the nation's fentanyl crisis. Fentanyl deaths tripled in Arizona alone from 2015 through 2017.
""It's the worst I've seen in 30 years, this toll that it's taken on families,"" said Doug Coleman, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of Arizona. ""The crack (cocaine) crisis was not as bad.""

With plenty of pills and powder sold locally out of the arriving fentanyl shipments that are also distributed around the U.S., the drug that has surpassed heroin for overdose deaths has touched all Arizona demographic groups. Chavez' family says he was working at a restaurant as a prep cook with dreams of becoming a chef and trying to turn his life around after serving prison time for a robbery conviction.
Also killed in the state over the last year by the pills that go for $9 to $30 each were a 17-year-old star high school baseball pitcher from a Phoenix suburb and a pair of 19-year-old best friends and prominent former high school athletes from the mountain town of Prescott Valley. The parents of one, Gunner Bundrick, said their son's death left ""a hole in our hearts.""
Popping the pills at parties ""is a lot more widespread than we know,"" said Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Nate Auvenshine. ""There's less stigma to taking a pill than putting a needle in your arm, but one of these pills can have enough fentanyl for three people.""
MAN CLAIMS ENERGY DRINK ADDICTION ROTTED HIS TEETH, CAUSED SEVERE PAIN
Stamped with ""M''on one side and ""30"" on the other to make them look like legitimate oxycodone, the pills started showing up in Arizona in recent years as the Sinaloa cartel's newest drug product, said Tucson Police Lt. Christian Wildblood.
The fentanyl that killed Chavez was among 1,000 pills sneaked across the border crossing last year in Nogales, Arizona by a woman who was paid $200 to tote them and gave two to Chavez at the party, according to court documents. It's unknown if he took one or both.
They will sell you poison, take your money, and not think twice about how they could possibly be killing someone's son, father, brother or grandson.
 Leslie Chavez
At the same crossing last month, U.S. officials announced their biggest fentanyl bust ever — nearly 254 pounds (115 kilograms) seized from a truckload of cucumbers, enough to potentially kill millions. Valued at $3.5 million, most was in powder form and over 2 pounds (1 kilogram) was made up of pills.
The tablets in most cases are manufactured in primitive conditions with pill presses purchased online and the amount of fentanyl in each pill can vary widely, Wildblood said.
""There is no quality control,"" he said.
While Chinese shipments were long blamed for illegal fentanyl entering the U.S., Mexico's Army in November 2017 discovered a rustic fentanyl lab in a remote part of Sinaloa state and seized precursors, finished fentanyl and production equipment — suggesting some of it is now being synthesized across the U.S. border.
This photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Phoenix Division shows some of the 30,000 fentanyl pills the agency seized in one of its bigger busts, in Tempe, Ariz., in August, 2017.

Most fentanyl smuggled from Mexico is about 10 percent pure and enters hidden in vehicles at official border crossings around Nogales and San Diego, Customs and Border Protection data show. A decreasing number of smaller shipments with purity of up to 90 percent still enter the U.S. in packages sent from China.
Although 85 percent of the fentanyl from Mexico is seized at San Diego area border crossings, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment said seizures have surged at Arizona's border and elsewhere around the state.
DEA statistics show Arizona fentanyl seizures rose to 445 pounds (202 kilograms), including 379,557 pills, in the fiscal year ending in October 2018, up from 172 pounds (78 kilograms), including 54,984 pills, during the previous 12-month period.
The Sinaloa cartel's ability to ramp up its own production of fentanyl and label it oxycodone shows the group's business acumen and why it remains among the world's top criminal organizations, despite the conviction in New York this week of cartel kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera, Coleman said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says fentanyl is now the drug involved in the most fatal overdoses in the U.S., with fatalities from synthetic opioids including fentanyl jumping more than 45 percent from 2016 to 2017, when they accounted for some 28,000 of about 70,000 overdose deaths of all kinds.
Fentanyl was also involved more than any other drug in the majority of overdose deaths in 2016, the year the pop artist Prince died after taking fake Vicodin laced with fentanyl. Heroin was responsible for the most drug overdose deaths each of the four years before that.

CDC figures for Arizona show the statewide deaths involving synthetic opioids excluding methadone, largely from fentanyl, rose from 72 in 2015 to 123 in 2016 and then skyrocketed to 267 in 2017.
In the first federal conviction of its kind in Arizona that linked a death to distribution of any drug, a woman from a Phoenix suburb last year got 12 years in prison for selling fentanyl tablets that killed a 38-year-old Arizona man.
And in Tucson, Chavez' relatives wonder why the woman accused of smuggling the pills across the border allegedly decided to hand them out at the party, saying they were Percocet, which contains oxycodone and acetaminophen, and ""something else,"" according to court documents.
The woman, Jocelyn Sanchez, denied describing them that way and was charged with transporting and transferring narcotics. Her lawyer, Joel Chorny, declined to discuss the case.

"EL PASO Outside a Border Patrol station overflowing with Central American families, the top U.S. border security official made an urgent appeal to lawmakers Wednesday for more resources and authorities, warning of an unprecedented migration surge that has pushed his agency to the breaking point. 
Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, gathered reporters and television cameras near an improvised holding pen beneath an overpass where U.S. agents have been processing hundreds of parents and children in a dusty parking lot. He said he has warned Congress of the unfolding chaos and called for immediate action to address this broken framework.
That breaking point has arrived this week at our border, he said. CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our southwest border and nowhere has that crisis manifested more acutely than here in El Paso.
Just before the commissioner began speaking, a group of nine parents and children from El Salvador and Panama traversed the Rio Grande, and agents led them to the processing center on foot.
McAleenans statements reflect the growing desperation among Homeland Security officials faced with a border influx that is on pace to be the largest in more than a decade, led by Guatemalan and Honduran asylum seekers who arrive with children and surrender to U.S. agents. McAleenan said his agency currently has 12,000 migrants in its custody.
McAleenan said Border Patrol holding stations are so dangerously overcrowded that CBP is releasing migrants directly into the United States for the first time in more than a decade.
Some have been seriously ill, including infants with 105 degree fevers, a two-year-old suffering seizures in the desert, a 19-year-old woman with a congenital heart defect who needs emergency surgery and a 40-year-old man suffering multi-organ failure. Others have lice, the flu, and chickenpox.
We are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a CBP facility, McAleenan said. But with these numbers, with the types of illnesses were seeing at the border, I fear that its just a matter of time.
He blamed the surge on smugglers and U.S. laws that he said encourage illegal migration because migrants are virtually guaranteed to be released in the United States.
Theres no questioning why this is happening, he said.
Thousands more Central Americans are waiting in Mexico, at shelters in Ciudad Juarez, and U.S. officials believe they likely will cross the river in coming days and weeks. 
Though Border Patrol apprehensions remain below their annual peak of 1.6 million in 2000, the nature of the increasing migration flows has shifted dramatically, and that shift is driving the alarm. In prior eras, most of the migrants were adult men who could be easily deported to Mexico; now, many of those attempting to cross the border are asylum-seeking Central American families and, to a lesser degree, minors traveling on their own. Because those seeking asylum have a legal right to have their cases evaluated, most families are released into the United States to await hearings in clogged immigration courts, a process that can take months or years.
President Trump has cited the immigration surge to bolster his push for a border wall. The migrants arriving here are crossing the Rio Grande, arriving in place where the United States already has formidable, modern border barriers. By surrendering to agents on U.S. soil the strip of land between the river and the tall U.S. fencing the migrants can assert their legal right to seek asylum.
Border Patrol holding cells in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas also are overcrowded, as are facilities in Arizona, where large groups of Guatemalan families have been arriving at remote desert areas to surrender, Border Patrol officials said.
The most dangerous overcrowding is here in the El Paso area, where Border Patrol stations are at 300 percent to 400 percent capacity, leaving families in cramped, unsanitary holding cells with little or no access to hot food and showers.
Most parents who arrive with a child are issued an appointment with an immigration judge. But agents are so overwhelmed by the volume that they often are doing little more than a cursory screening, officials said.
The border security compromise Democrats reached with President Trump last month includes $415 million to improve medical care and detention conditions for families and children in U.S. custody, including the construction of a new child-appropriate processing center in El Paso. But that facility is not likely to open for at least six months, CBP officials say.
In the meantime, the number of migrants crossing the border to turn themselves in has continued to soar. The agency detained more than 3,700 migrants on Monday, the highest one-day total at the border in a decade.
U.S. authorities detained more than 76,000 in February, and this month, they are on pace to exceed 95,000, according to the CBP projections. 
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen met with senior Mexican officials in Miami on Tuesday for unannounced talks, telling her counterparts that cross-border trade and commerce are likely to suffer as more CBP officers are pulled away to cope with the migration surge.
CBP is preparing to temporarily reassign 750 blue-uniformed officers from its Office of Field Operations to help the Border Patrol, according to a senior DHS official, and Nielsen told Mexican interior minister Olga Sanchez Cordero that move likely will produce longer wait times for trucks and vehicles seeking to cross. 
Secretary Nielsen said very bluntly that if we didnt work jointly, our resources are pulled away, and that creates problems for us and on the Mexican side in terms of facilitating commerce, and we want to avoid that, said the senior DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. 
Nielsen also is readying a plan to ask volunteers from the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration and other Homeland Security agencies to go to the border to help with the flood of Central American families, the official said, adding: We are burning red hot right now, and we are looking everywhere for help. 
Nielsen arrived in Honduras on Tuesday for meetings with Central American leaders aimed at increasing efforts to deter migration to the United States and to crack down on smuggling organizations.","U.S. has hit ‘breaking point’ at border amid immigration surge, Customs and Border Protection commissioner says The Washington Post US shuts interior checkpoints to focus on Mexico border Fox News Number of migrants stopped at the southern border could reach …",2019-03-27T16:38:43Z,"U.S. has hit ‘breaking point’ at border amid immigration surge, Customs and Border Protection commissioner says - The Washington Post",The Washington Post,0
"Trump inauguration finances under criminal investigation: WSJ It’s easy to imagine White House officials showing up for work every day wondering what new scandal will unfold before they leave their desks. Yesterday, it was new reporting that Donald Trump’s inaugural committee is dealing with scrutiny from prosecutors – both over the money it received and the money it spent. How would White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defend this? She doesn’t generally answer reporters questions anymore, but Sanders still talks to Fox News, telling the network this morning that Trump’s inaugural committee shouldn’t be seen as connected to Trump. This didn’t have anything to do with the president, he was focused on the transition and building out a new government and preparing to take office, Sanders told Fox News Thursday night. The role that the president had in the inauguration was to raise his hand and take the oath. I think this is a perfect example of Democrats recognizing that all the accusations they made and the information that came out of the Michael Cohen case has nothing to do with the president, she continued. So now they’re going to – I would say plan B, but this is more like plan D or E or F to take this president down. I can appreciate how difficult it must be to serve as this president’s chief spokesperson, especially given the current circumstances, but Sanders is going to have to do better than this. For example, if the White House press secretary believes possible crimes committed by the president’s inaugural committee won’t reflect poorly on the president, she’s mistaken. What’s more, Sanders criticisms of Democrats in this case is odd: it’s federal prosecutors, not Dems, who are reportedly investigating the inaugural committee’s controversial finances. Similarly, if Trump’s press secretary wants people to believe Michael Cohen’s felonies had nothing to do with the president, Sanders may need to take this up with the federal prosecutors who’ve directly implicated Trump in Cohen’s felonies. But I especially liked Sanders idea that the president’s detractors, frustrated by the failures of their other lines of attack, keep scrambling to find new controversies. The trouble, of course, is that all of the controversies are both legitimate and ongoing. This isn’t a dynamic in which discredited scandals are discarded to make room for baseless new allegations; it’s a situation in which the flood of real scandals never seems to stop. If Sarah Huckabee Sanders has a defense that can explain all of this away, I’m eager to hear it.","It must be tough to serve as Trump's chief spokesperson, especially given the current circumstances, but Sanders is going to have to do better than this.",2018-12-14T16:20:14Z,White House: Don't blame Trump for his inaugural committee,MSNBC,0
"HONG KONG (Reuters) - An unprecedented boom in the $280 billion aircraft finance industry is showing signs of faltering as rising interest rates, cut-rate competition and higher oil prices trigger a shakeout in a sector that has attracted a flood of Chinese funding. Conferences in Hong Kong last week saw more than 1,000 financiers, lawyers and airline bosses talk up the fundamentals of an industry that has emerged as a flourishing asset class globally, but in contrast to previous years the mood was one of subdued optimism even as corks popped on new deals. Concerns about central bank tightening, trade rows and currency swings could blow some froth, they cautioned. “I think the party is over in terms of lower interest rates,” said Robert Martin, CEO of Asia’s largest-listed aircraft lessor BOC Aviation ( 2588.HK ). The sector veteran of three decades noted that smaller players who had not matched their funding needs to liabilities, unlike larger ones like his company, would find it difficult to ride out any volatility. The failure to do so has caused some high-profile collapses, such as Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) in the 1990s. The former GPA executives who now dominate the industry say the sector has matured and is backed by diversified sources of funding as aviation finance sits proudly alongside property and infrastructure as alternatives to traditional market bets. Yet danger signals have emerged, such as stronger dollar.DXY hitting the coffers of many airlines just as they must adjust to a spike in oil prices LCOc1. That could land unwanted aircraft back into the laps of lessors needing to find new takers. In a sign of turbulence ahead, global airlines have already slashed profit forecasts due to high oil prices. A few leasing companies are also quietly giving airlines rental ‘holidays’ to help their cash flows, sources said. And some airlines are increasing traffic only by cutting prices, which will hurt all but those with the lowest costs, said Rob Morris, chief consultant at Flight Ascend. According to Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of asset managers IBA: “The market is poised for the start of a correction. There are too many signals.” “When airlines feel pain, lessors feel pain.” DEALS DRIVE DOWN YIELDS The industry, however, remains in better shape than in previous cycles, driven by consolidation in the United States. Airlines have begun to recoup their costs of capital in the past four years after decades of value destruction, according to the International Air Transport Association. Demand for financing for new commercial aircraft deliveries is expected to rise almost 7 percent this year to $139 billion, Boeing ( BA.N ) has said. Last week, financiers were busy doing deals overlooking Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour at conferences hosted by Airline Economics and Euromoney’s Airfinance Journal. Lessors say liquidity is abundant and that financial strains in one part of the globe can be offset by demand elsewhere. Currently, Chinese capital accounts for about 30 percent of the funding deployed by leasing firms worldwide, up from 5 percent about nine years ago. But while the carousel continues, the flood of new money chasing deals has lowered returns for most in the industry. Goshawk Aviation, a venture of Hong Kong conglomerate NWS Holdings ( 0659.HK ) and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, says the sector’s low yields are not feasible for long. Brian Cheng, executive director at NWS that bought Dublin-based Sky Aviation Leasing this year, said he had seen funding bids from companies that are prepared to accept returns of 3-5 percent on their aircraft investments. “Insurance companies or banks can achieve (these rates) because their borrowing costs are so low... but for us there’s no way to compete with that.” “SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE” Against that backdrop, opportunistic M&amp;A is also picking up. Japan’s Orix Corp ( 8591.T ) struck a $2.2 billion deal this year for a 30 percent stake in leasing firm Avolon Holdings. SMBC Aviation Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking’s leasing arm, expects to receive an extra $1 billion from shareholders in a couple of months, Peter Barrett, CEO of the world’s No. 5 lessor said. But with air pockets in sight, industry executives increasingly point to an expected shakeout among smaller lessors. Some smaller Chinese players are already pulling back. “It’s like driving a car on the expressway. Everybody is on the gas pedal right now. No one is going to the gas station or taking a break. Everybody is full throttle but something has got to give. Some cars will just head off to the exit,” Cheng said.

"Small towns on some of the nation's most flood-prone rivers are struggling to afford flood-protection systems.
Most communities along America's rivers have some sort of flood protection usually a concrete wall or an earthen levee. But a few places can't afford it, such as Clarksville, Missouri; Watertown, South Dakota; and Hamburg, Iowa.
Even when Congress authorizes money, the local share of a major flood project is often more than a small town can pay for. Some communities also struggle with the aesthetics of flood barriers. They worry that large walls will spoil the waterfront streets that are popular with tourists.
With major flooding becoming more common, leaders of some small towns are resigned to the ritual of sandbagging and evacuating every time the water rises.","Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. As authorities on Sunday continued to search for bodies in the destroyed Northern California town of Paradise, fire weather returned to Southern California, with parched air pouring down from the mountains and generating flare-ups from the historic Woolsey Fire. DC-10 air tankers fought the wind gusts to drop bright-red flame retardant on rugged, unburned terrain as the fire invaded canyons where California meets the Pacific Ocean. At midday Sunday, the combined efforts of several thousand firefighters seemed to have the Woolsey Fire, now a protracted disaster, in check. But the red-flag warnings critical fire conditions were forecast to last across the region until 5 p.m. Tuesday. Fire chiefs had warned that the dreaded Santa Ana winds would be back around 10 a.m. Sunday, and they were right. The winds kicked up just as officials were holding a news conference warning that conditions remained dangerous. As they spoke, a massive plume of smoke rose in the southern sky from the direction of Malibu. The Woolsey Fire had burned 83,000 acres by Sunday morning, with just 10 percent containment. The lull in the wind Saturday gave firefighters a chance to create firebreaks and drop massive amounts of fire retardant, but officials Sunday were anxious about a re-energized Woolsey Fire and the kind of weather that can create an entirely new, uncontrollable wildfire almost anywhere in tinder-dry California. In Northern California, the Camp Fire, which wiped out Paradise and is blamed for the deaths of at least 23 people and the burning of nearly 7,000 buildings, is officially the most destructive individual fire in California history. It also is one of the deadliest fires California has ever seen and the most lethal wildfire in the state since 1991. The 1933 Griffith Park wildfire in Los Angeles County killed 29. Sheriffs deputies and officials from the coroners office have been examining charred homes that have been too hot for body-sniffing dogs. Authorities were investigating more than 100 reports of missing people. Some of the missing might simply be unable to make contact due to lack of cellphone coverage in the disaster zone, which many had to flee on short notice as the fast-moving fire advanced on residential areas. Some of the victims died in their cars as they attempted to escape. Authorities have not released the names of victims, and Paradise, a city of 27,000 popular with retirees, is quarantined. The city is without power and has no operational businesses, and few residents have returned. Paradise has been essentially obliterated. Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honeas office has ordered an additional DNA lab truck and received help from anthropologists at California State University at Chico for the time-consuming and daunting task of identifying victims. In some cases, investigators have found just pieces of bone. Already the most destructive wildfire in California history, the Camp Fire in the Sierra Nevada foothills has become the states third-deadliest killing 23 people in three days, with more than 100 people unaccounted for in a charred swath of land larger than Detroit. Although the fire had been 25 percent contained by Sunday, high temperatures and gusty winds made the weather optimal for the Northern California fire to spread for at least another day. President Trump alternated between offering sympathy for displaced people and firefighters, and lashing out at Californias leaders over what he deemed poor forest management. With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart! he tweeted Sunday morning, echoing a refrain that he has frequently leveled at California officials including on Saturday and threatening to withhold federal money. Officials shot back that increasingly destructive fires are a result of global warming, which has led to weather that dries out vegetation and turns large swaths of grassland into a tinderbox. The Woolsey Fire began in a canyon of that name near the city of Simi Valley, and it spread primarily through open terrain with few trees and a great deal of waist-high and knee-high shrubs and grasses. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) requested a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration, which would make the hardest-hit communities eligible for housing, unemployment and other support programs and allow state and local governments to repair or replace fire-damaged facilities and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted a state request for emergency aid. The Woolsey Fire has been linked to two deaths, both still under investigation, but its effects have been broad. Were concerned about the fire jumping out, coming behind us, burning a lot of the territory that has not burned, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. He said the footprint of the Woolsey Fire contains many unburned areas that are vulnerable to embers stoked by wind gusts that could reach 45 mph. The immediate concern was that the fire would be pushed by the Santa Ana winds south along the Pacific Coast, from Malibu to Topanga Canyon and on to Pacific Palisades and the doorstep of Santa Monica. The only thing were not concerned about is the ocean, Osby said. The officials pounded home a warning to residents: Dont go back into the mandatory evacuation zones. Stay away. Please, please do not come back to our city yet, said Illece Buckley-Weber, a city council member in Agoura Hills. It is not safe. Many residents have been standing their ground, refusing to evacuate and vowing to defend their property. Fire officials want them out of the way because of the scale of the response and the need to use heavy equipment and fire hoses. They point out that embers from a fire can fly a mile from the front edge of a fire and trap people amid the flames. And these fires are hard to outrun because they have been whipped by heavy winds. The Santa Ana wind conditions are no different than the tornadoes or the massive flood conditions we see in the East, said Nick Schuler, a Cal Fire deputy chief, as he looked at the billowing cloud of smoke over Malibu. You cant outrun a tornado. Despite those warnings, people have drifted home to mandatory evacuation zones, some fearing looters, though only a couple of arrests have been made, officials said. Ive been evacuated twice. So I totally understand the heartache and the stress, said Chief John Benedict of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. Please, please be patient with us. The twin fire disasters in Northern and Southern California have provided a reminder that climate change is altering the basic equations of fire suppression. When Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen stopped in the morning to visit one of his firefighters at home, he noticed a plant burning in the yard. It was an ice plant. Its a succulent thats supposed to be fire-resistant. Ice plant is not supposed to burn, Lorenzen said at a news conference. Were entering a new normal. Things are not the way they were 10 years ago. The rate of spread is exponentially more than it used to be. And local officials are looking toward the next potential hazard as a result of the wildfires, as winter rains loom ahead the shadow disaster of mudslides. Were going to find ourselves really quickly after this in mudslide territory, warned Henry Stern, a state senator who represents Malibu and Thousand Oaks. The fire ripped right through the root stock. Theres nothing left to hold those hillsides together. Wootson reported from Washington. Mason Trinca, in Paradise, Calif., contributed to this report.","Washington Post 'It is not safe.' California wildfires continue deadly assault on populated areas.

"LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A “wall of money” is set to flood into emerging markets assets now the U.S. Federal Reserve has eased the risk of a sharp rise in global borrowing costs, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said on Thursday. 
The IIF, which closely tracks financing flows, said its high frequency indicators were picking up a “sharp spike” of inflows following last week’s confirmation of a change of tack from the U.S. central bank. 
“Recent events look likely to restart the ‘Wall of Money’ to Emerging Markets,” IIF economists said in a report. 
They said the money was likely to flow in broadly, although it could have the biggest impact in places like Brazil and Russia where investors had been giving a wider berth. 
“The hunt for yield will put positioning front and centre,” the economists said, adding that in contrast to Brazil and Russia, South African assets had been heavily bought up already. 
Emerging markets have overcome a brutal 2018 with a blistering start to this year. 
The premium investors demand to hold EM government debt rather than ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries has dropped around 100 basis points, while the MSCI EM stocks index has charged up more than 10 percent. 
The MSCI index this week scored a rare ‘golden cross’ where the 50-day moving average overtakes the 100-day moving average, something seen by keen chart watchers as a positive signal for things to come. 
“Up until recently, it had been the case that China was driving much of the pick-up (in EM flows), but the picture has broadened out in recent weeks, especially where equities are concerned,” the IIF said 
“(Extrapolating) the year-to-date flows to a quarterly frequency shows that Q1 is tracking around $48 billion, a number that is already equal to strong EM inflows in 2017 and likely to go higher,” it added.

"SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are wooing buyers with offers to sell gas priced against benchmarks other than U.S. domestic prices, ahead of an expected flood of supplies on global markets this year. 
The United States, the world’s fastest growing gas exporter thanks to surging output from shale fields, is set to become the world’s third-largest LNG exporter this year, taking on more established suppliers such as Qatar and Australia. 
U.S. producers only began exporting LNG in early 2016 and typically price their sales against U.S. domestic benchmarks such as Henry Hub. 
To stand out, at least two developers of new U.S. terminals have signed binding and non-binding deals using alternative pricing, executives said on the sidelines of the LNG2019 conference in Shanghai this week. 
On Wednesday, Tellurian Inc and French oil and gas major Total SA signed a deal that includes both companies entering into a binding agreement for 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG from Tellurian, which is developing the Driftwood LNG project in Louisiana. 
The price was based on Platts Japan Korea Marker (JKM), which is a fast-developing Asian benchmark for LNG though mainly for spot cargoes. Most LNG contracts in Asia are still priced off Brent crude. 
Tellurian and commodities trader Vitol have also signed a memorandum of understanding for long-term LNG supply priced off JKM. 
“I believe LNG is moving (toward) a gas index,” said Total’s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne. 
“Gas linked to oil is old world and we have seen in the past two years the JKM-linked market is growing,” he added. 
Banks are also getting more supportive of JKM-linked pricing for the sale of LNG cargoes, said Tellurian’s chief executive Meg Gentle. 
NextDecade Corp, which is developing the Rio Grande LNG export project in Brownsville, Texas, said on Tuesday it has signed a 20-year binding sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with Royal Dutch Shell for two million tonnes a year of LNG, which it said was first U.S. long-term contract indexed to Brent. 
Three quarters of the LNG will be indexed to Brent crude oil prices and the remaining volumes will be indexed to domestic U.S. gas price markers, including Henry Hub, the company said. 
NextDecade is also offering its potential buyers LNG priced on other U.S. gas indexes such as Agua Dulce and Waha. 
“U.S. gas producers may be willing to take exposure to oil linked LNG netback pricing compared with the depressed U.S. gas prices seen lately,” said Saul Kavonic, a Credit Suisse analyst. 
Next-day natural gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged to negative levels in late March, but have recovered slightly since.

"(Reuters) - California is bracing for its wettest storm of the winter as the “Pineapple Express” is set to dump up to 8 inches (20 cm) of rain and 8 feet (2.44 m) of snow on areas of the state, raising risks of flooding and mudslides, meteorologists said. 
The weather system, known as an atmospheric river, gets its name from the flow of moisture that periodically heads east from waters adjacent to the Hawaiian Islands to soak the U.S. West Coast. It blanketed parts of Hawaii with snow over the weekend and was expected to drench California this week. 
The San Francisco Bay area could be hit by flash flooding and falling trees as saturated ground gets up to 8 inches more rain and strong winds blow in, the National Weather Service said. 
To the northeast in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, passes could see between 80 and 100 inches (2-2.54 m) of snow through Friday. 
Valley areas face flood watches over fears the relatively warm Pineapple Express system could initially drench areas as high as Lake Tahoe with rain, melting snow and swelling rivers. 
“It’s looking like the wettest storm we’ve seen this winter,” said Cory Mueller, a NWS meteorologist in Sacramento, California. 
The system was among multiple winter storms hammering the United States from Seattle to Boston, causing commuter headaches and risks of power outages for millions of Americans. 
WILDFIRE BURN AREAS 
The Central and Southern California coast can expect flash flooding and possible mudslides near recent wildfire burn areas, the NWS reported. 
Up to 2 inches (5 cm) of rain were expected in the Los Angeles area between Tuesday evening and Thursday morning, the weather service said. 
“The morning commute is going to be a mess tomorrow,” said Scott Rowe, an NWS meteorologist in the San Francisco Bay area. 
A string of winter storms have swelled snowpack in California to above-average levels, delighting farmers in need of water and skiers in search of powder. 
Seattle had its snowiest month in 50 years after being hit by three winter storms in February, according to AccuWeather. 
Ski areas like Sierra-at-Tahoe in California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains have received 129 inches (3 m) of snow in the past 30 days. The resort was forced to close on Sunday after 30 inches (76 cm) of snow fell overnight, shutting nearby highways. 
“It made for an incredible powder day yesterday,” said resort spokeswoman Sarah Sherman.

"(Reuters) - Nebraska Public Power District’s (NPPD) Cooper nuclear plant in Nebraska was still operating at full power early Monday after the company said on Friday it was preparing for possible flooding, according to a report from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). 
Officials at NPPD were not immediately available for comment Monday morning. 
The company said on Friday that the plant continued to operate safely and “there is no threat to plant employees or to the public.” 
On Friday, NPPD declared an “unusual event” at Cooper because of the possibility of flooding along the Missouri River following a powerful winter storm last week. 
The late winter storm, dubbed a “bomb cyclone” by meteorologists, spawned blizzards and tornados and left floods in its wake after hitting the U.S. Mountain and Plains states last week, before pushing east into the Midwest and the Great Lakes Region early Friday. 
NPPD said its workers have filled sandbags along a river levee and procured other materials and supplies for flood protection. 
The biggest danger to a nuclear plant from flooding is the loss of power, which can make it difficult to circulate the water needed to cool the uranium fuel in the reactor core and the fuel stored in the spent-fuel pool. 
That caused the fuel in some reactor cores at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan to partially melt down in 2011 after a giant earthquake and tsunami cut power to the plant. 
Since Fukushima, all U.S. reactors have been upgraded with additional safety equipment, including portable pumps and generators to keep cooling water circulating through the reactor in case the plant loses offsite power. 
NPPD said its procedures require it to declare an unusual event to the NRC when the Missouri River tops 899 feet above sea level. It reached 899.05 feet Friday morning, the company said. 
Should the river rise to 900 feet above sea level, NPPD said plant workers will “barricade internal doorways as another layer of protection for facility equipment.” 
If the river reaches 901.5 feet, NPPD said it would take the station offline as a protective measure. 
The plant was built at 903 feet above sea level, which is 13 feet above natural grade, NPPD said. 
The 770-megawatt Cooper station is three miles (4.8 km) southeast of Brownville, Nebraska, near the Missouri River. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.

"(Reuters) - Blizzards and windstorms will punish the U.S. Plains and Midwest on Wednesday as a powerful late winter storm threatens more flooding in areas like South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and farms along the Missouri River. 
High spring temperatures will give way to heavy snow, gale-force winds and life-threatening conditions across a swath of the central United States running from the Rockies to the Great Lakes, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). 
The Pacific-born storm has already sparked flood evacuations in Oregon. Rain and then blowing snow was expected to hit the Rockies on Wednesday, before moving east into the plains, the NWS Forecast Office in Boulder, Colorado, reported. 
Some areas of western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota were expected to get up to 30 inches of wet, heavy snow, the NWS said. 
“A potentially historic winter storm will bring severe impacts Wednesday night into early Friday,” the weather service’s Twin Cities office tweeted. 
The same central U.S. area was hit by a “bomb cyclone” less than a month ago that brought deadly flooding and blizzards that closed roads and paralyzed transportation. 
A whiplash in temperatures from a high of 80 Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) in some cities on Tuesday to frigid conditions on Wednesday was expected to supercharge the storm with cold air. That was the case on March 13 when a sudden drop in air pressure turned a potent storm into a so-called bomb cyclone. 
Areas like the Pine Ridge Reservation and northwest Missouri’s Holt County are still recovering from last month’s flooding which caused billions of dollars in damage. 
Flooding was not expected to be as bad in Nebraska this time as the ground had thawed and could absorb more water. 
Still, the coming storm was expected to exacerbate flooding along the Missouri River in areas where dozens of levees were breached in March, exposing communities to future surges. The river was not expected to crest in areas of Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri until between three to five days after the storm.

"A wall of rocks and sandbags is protecting scenic Clarksville, Missouri, from the surging Mississippi River as spring flooding swamps fields, threatens homes and temporarily shut down a bridge connecting Missouri and Illinois.
Heavy rain over much of the Midwest on Saturday caused another spike in water levels along the river and its tributaries, especially in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.
Clarksville is a small village known for antique shops and artist galleries. It has no levee, so volunteers built a rock wall topped with sandbags.
In nearby Louisiana, Missouri, floodwater near the bridge deck on the Illinois side forced closure of the Champ Clark Bridge Sunday night. But by Monday morning the river had crested, the deck was dry, and the bridge reopened.
The route for Sunday's Go St. Louis marathon and half-marathon has been changed. The original finish line for the 15,000 expected runners was near the Gateway Arch. That road is covered in Mississippi River water, so the run will end elsewhere in downtown.","A wall of rocks and sandbags is protecting scenic Clarksville, Missouri, from the surging Mississippi River as the spring flood closed roads, threatened homes and temporarily shut down a bridge connecting Missouri and Illinois",2019-04-01T16:32:00Z,More rain causes new flood worries along the Mississippi,ABC News,1
"Gun owners' groups estimate that more than a million high-capacity ammunition magazines flooded into California during a one-week window created when a federal judge temporarily threw out the state's ban.
Reform groups said Thursday that the projections are self-serving as gun rights organizations try to make the case that magazines holding more than 10 bullets are so common now that a ban is impractical.
But there are plenty of anecdotal indications that the floodgates briefly opened when U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez overturned the state's nearly 20-year-old ban late last month. He halted sales a week later, but says those who bought the magazines can legally own them during the state's appeal.

"(Reuters) - A Pacific storm system known as the “Pineapple Express” threatened to dump up to 8 inches (20 cm) of rain and 8 feet (2.44 m) of snow on areas of California, raising risks of flooding and mudslides, meteorologists said on Wednesday. 
“The (Pineapple) Express is no joke,” said Bob Oravec, meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland of the strongest weather system of the season. 
The weather system, also known as an atmospheric river, gets its name from the flow of moisture that periodically heads east from waters adjacent to the Hawaiian Islands to soak the U.S. West Coast. It blanketed parts of Hawaii with snow over the weekend and is expected to drench California. 
The San Francisco Bay area could be hit by flash flooding and falling trees as saturated ground gets up to 8 inches more rain and strong winds blow in, the weather service said. 
“We’re talking 3 to 5 inches of rain in San Francisco and coastal areas in just the next 24 hours, and more on into Friday,” Oravec said. 
To the northeast in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, passes could see between 80 and 100 inches (2-2.54 m) of snow through Friday. 
Valley areas face flood watches over fears the relatively warm Pineapple Express system could initially drench areas as high as Lake Tahoe with rain, melting snow and swelling rivers. 
WILDFIRE BURN AREAS 
The Central and Southern California coast can expect flash flooding and possible mudslides near recent wildfire burn areas, the NWS reported. 
Oravec said that the problem is not just the amount of rain, but the fact that it will hit in a short amount of time. 
“It’s going to be heavy and fast,” he said. “Debris flows and mud slides are a risk in any area scorched by the wildfires. There’s little to no vegetation to slow that water down.” 
Up to 2 inches (5 cm) of rain was expected in the Los Angeles area between Tuesday evening and Thursday morning, the weather service said. 
A string of winter storms has swelled snowpack in California to above-average levels, delighting farmers in need of water and skiers in search of powder.

"DENVER (Reuters) - Runways were cleared, the lights came back on and stranded motorists and airline passengers were back on the move on Thursday as the blizzard that pounded the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Plains states shoves eastward and fizzled to rain. 
Shortly after midnight, four of the six runways at Denver International Airport had been cleared, spokeswoman Emily Williams told Reuters. 
And while some flights resumed, the airport was not expected to be fully operational until midday on Thursday as airlines had still had to dispatch more planes to Denver to replace those diverted or canceled earlier, she said. 
Flight cancellations were down to around 600 for Thursday, from more than 1,300 in the region a day earlier. 
Power outages in Colorado still affected about 95,000 customers and fewer than 5,000 in Texas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. 
Stranded motorists across the region had been reached and helped before midnight, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol spokesman said early Thursday. Around 1,100 motorists were reported as stranded on Interstate 25 near Colorado Springs a day earlier. 
A state of emergency was still in effect in Colorado as cities and towns dig out from the storm during which gusts of 70 mpg pushed tractor trailers sidewise and left up to two feet of snow in some areas. 
The storm was blamed for the death of a Colorado state trooper who was hit by a car sliding on ice on the highway while he attended to a car wreck. 
Schools and government offices remained closed Thursday across the region. 
“There’s still a few headlines left on this storm,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. 
The storm - previously dubbed a “bomb cyclone” for its quick, late season punch - was still expected to prompt warnings of blizzards and snow before noon in north central Kansas and Nebraska, Hurley said. 
Remnants of the snow fall and rain would clear from Denver and the mountain and plains areas by midday, he said. 
“By mid-morning the heart of the storm will be western Iowa, headed toward Wisconsin and Michigan, where it will bring about a half-inch of warm rain,” Hurley said. 
Some flood watches and warnings were in place in the midwest as rain will spur accumulated snow to melt, he said.

"(CNN) The deadliest blaze in California history is nearly contained after firefighters got a little help from the rain. While more rain Friday could mean an end to the two-week fire, it also brings the risks of flooding and mudslides. The Camp Fire in Northern California, which has killed 84 people, is now 95% contained, according to Cal Fire. An-inch-and-a-half of rain Wednesday all but extinguished the blaze, National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Rasch said. Just that inch and a half of precipitation hit the ""sweet spot,"" Rasch said. ""We needed it to come in and rain, and rain not too heavy."" Water is the solution for the scorched region, extinguishing the flames and clearing the smoke from the air. But it also brings more problems: flooding, mudslides and the flow of debris. ""Rainfall that would normally be absorbed will run off extremely quickly after a wildfire, as burned soil can be as water-repellent as pavement,"" the National Weather Service said. The National Weather Service has two meteorologists onsite monitoring conditions at the Camp Fire. Rasch said they are paying close attention to the rate of rainfall, as two to four inches were forecast to hit the upper end of the Campfire by Friday morning. New obstacles to recovery Floods, mudslides, and debris flow is an especially dangerous cocktail following the devastation of a wildfire. ""It makes the ground really unstable for firefighters, Sacramento Fire Capt. Dave Lauchner told CNN affiliate KTXL on Thursday. ""But we just keep our eyes open, make sure we're in safe areas and watch out for each other."" Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea told the affiliate that his department would continue searching for the missing as long as conditions were not too dangerous. But floods and mudslides may bring danger right to victims' backyards. Almost 1 million people in Northern California are under a flash flood watch that remains in effect through Friday morning, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. ""If you can look uphill from where you are and see a burnt-out area, you are at risk,"" the National Weather Service said. And the risk of damage is both great and far-reaching. The running debris and flood water can be powerful enough to destroy culverts, roadways and buildings, the National Weather Service said, even reaching miles away from the affected areas. They fled the fire, now they are fleeing the water About 10 minutes from Paradise, a town devastated by the Camp Fire, evacuees with nowhere else to go have set up a temporary encampment in a Walmart parking lot in Chico. The camp became a community where volunteers distributed essential supplies. ""Walmart was one of the generous community partners that offered a site for respite and relief. Courageous and compassionate community volunteers came together and built an immediate safe place for many evacuees,"" the city of Chico said in a statement. But as the weather turns, Walmart is encouraging the evacuees to find safer shelter. ""The weather forecast from the National Weather Service showing steady rain continuing through Friday has heightened our existing concerns and increased the urgency to find a more sustainable solution,"" company spokeswoman Delia Garcia said. The company and the city offered free bus rides to the steadily more available shelters, as well as gas gift cards, money and food. The Woolsey Fire in Southern California, where rain is also expected, reached 100% containment Wednesday. The fire has killed three people and burned nearly 100,000 acresbig enough for the scar to be seen from space via NASA's Terra satellite. Three residents of Ventura and Los Angeles counties have filed a complaint against Southern California Edison Company, a supplier of electricity. ""Had Southern California Edison Company followed the standard of care in inspecting, maintaining and repairing its overhead lines, properly maintaining its electrical equipment, and trimming away vegetation from its wires as is required by law and industry standards, the catastrophic Woolsey Fire could have been avoided,"" said Patrick McNicholas, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. Southern California Edison declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying Cal Fire and the Ventura County Fire Department are investigating the cause of the fire. A similar lawsuit on behalf of 22 victims of the Camp Fire was filed last week, claiming the electric company PG&amp;E was responsible for the fires. The company reported an outage on the day the fire began. In response, PG&amp;E said that the exact cause of the fire has not been determined.

"(Reuters) - Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) on Friday declared an “unusual event” at its Cooper nuclear power station in Nebraska due to the possibility of flooding along the Missouri River following a powerful winter storm this week. 
The plant continues to operate safely and “there is no threat to plant employees or to the public,” the utility said in a release. 
The late winter storm, dubbed a “bomb cyclone” by meteorologists, left blizzards, floods and tornados in its wake after hitting the U.S. Mountain and Plains states this week, before pushing east into the Midwest and the Great Lakes Region early Friday. 
NPPD said its workers have filled sandbags along the river levee and procured other materials and supplies for flood protection. 
The biggest danger to a nuclear plant from flooding is the loss of power, which can make it difficult to cool the uranium fuel in the reactor core and the fuel stored in the spent fuel pool. 
That is what caused the fuel in some reactor cores at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan to partially melt down in 2011 after a giant earthquake and tsunami cut power to the plant. 
Since Fukushima, all U.S. reactors have been upgraded with additional safety equipment, including portable pumps and generators to keep cooling water circulating through the reactor in case the plant loses offsite power. 
NPPD said its procedures require it to declare an unusual event to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission when the Missouri River tops 899 feet above sea level. It reached 899.05 feet Friday morning, the company said. 
Should the river rise to 900 feet above sea level, NPPD said plant workers will “barricade internal doorways as another layer of protection for facility equipment.” 
If the river reaches 901.5 feet above sea level, NPPD said it would take the station offline as a protective measure. 
The plant was built at 903 feet above sea level, which is 13 feet above natural grade, NPPD said. 
The Cooper station is three miles (4.8 km) southeast of Brownville, Nebraska, near the Missouri River.

"(Reuters) - A harsh late winter storm broadsided a vast swathe of the U.S. agriculture industry this week as heavy snow closed roads and buried cattle in the Plains while excessive rain flooded Midwest farm fields and swamped grain elevators. 
A “bomb cyclone” hurled hurricane-force winds, sparked tornadoes and dumped heavy snow and rain across the Plains and western Midwest on its march across the United States this week. 
Recovery from the storm is expected to take days or weeks, if not longer. Prolonged supply disruptions could rattle cattle, hog and feed grain markets around the region and futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
Archer Daniels Midland Co was forced to shutter its massive Columbus, Nebraska, corn processing facility due to flooding. The plant, which produces corn-based ethanol biofuel, is one of the largest in the world. 
“Right now, we do not have rail or road access to the facility because of the high water. We do not have an estimate yet on when we will be able to resume normal operations,” Chris Cuddy, president of ADM’s carbohydrate solutions business said in an emailed statement. 
How soon the facility will reopen will depend on the extent of the damage and how quickly floodwaters recede, he said. 
Rival agribusiness Cargill Inc closed its Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Albion, Nebraska, grain elevators at least through the weekend due to flooding, according to its website. 
In Albion, flooding also shuttered an adjacent ethanol plant operated by Valero Energy Corp, according to a Chicago grains trader. Valero could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Nebraska State Patrol posted photos and video on Twitter of dozens of cattle stranded on tiny islands in the flood-swollen Platte River near Fremont, Nebraska. 
The floods have posed challenges for ranchers as well as cattle feedlot operators who have already struggled through a long winter, with Omaha, Nebraska, recording its snowiest winter on record, according to the High Plains Regional Climate Center. Nebraska is the No. 2 cattle-producing state after Texas. 
“You’ve got stranded cattle, and a lot of flooding in the feedlots. You’ve got just a sea of mud, and it’s affecting performance,” said Alan Brugler, president of Omaha-based advisory service Brugler Marketing and Management. 
The cattle “are not gaining weight, they’ve got a lot of mud on them. It is definitely hurting the feedlot guys in terms of their efficiency,” he said. 
Further north in South Dakota, grazing cattle were slammed by heavy snow, with some cattle entirely buried.

"Two former executives of an alumina plant in Hungary were convicted and sentenced to prison Monday for an industrial disaster that killed eight people and injured more than 220 in flooded towns and villages, a Hungarian court said.
Zoltan B., the former CEO of MAL Zrt., received a prison term of 2 ½ years for public endangerment and other crimes, while Jozsef D., a deputy CEO, received a two-year sentence.
In keeping with privacy rules, the court did not identify the defendants by their full names.
On Oct. 4, 2010, a wall of a huge reservoir of the plant collapsed, flooding three towns and villages with about 2 million cubic meters (528 million gallons) of toxic red sludge and water.
The highly alkaline mix burned the skin of the victims, some of whom were swept away by the force of the rushing flood and drowned. One of the victims was 14 months old.
Eight other people on trial for the 2010 disaster received suspended prison sentences, fines or reprimands, while the city court in Gyor acquitted five. All 15 defendants were acquitted of all charges in 2016, but an appeals court ordered a retrial.
Monday's ruling was appealed by prosecutors, who asked for stricter sentences, and by most of the convicted defendants, seeking leaner penalties.
The trial court ruled that MAL Zrt. managers and employees broke numerous rules regarding the storage and handling of the leftover sludge and water from producing alumina, the main raw material for making aluminum.
""The defendants' negligence contributed to the catastrophe, since they did not deal with the warning signs of a possible breach,"" the court said in a statement. ""And they misled area residents and authorities regarding the true amount and toxicity of water accumulated due to the rule violations, which ultimately became determinant factors of the catastrophe.""
The court also said the defendants did not notify authorities or were late doing so regarding the sludge flood and its toxicity. The former CEO also made willfully misleading statements about the dangers of the spill, the court found.
The amount of water stored in the 25-hectare (61.8-acre) reservoir, over 1 million cubic meters (264 million gallons), was more than twice the limit and its toxicity exceeded the permissible level.
In its ruling Monday, the court also faulted poor planning, construction and maintenance of the reservoir.
Environmental group Greenpeace called the convictions ""historic"" but added that questions about the responsibility of the authorities in charge of overseeing the plant which in some cases didn't operate according to norms remained unanswered.
""For Hungary to avoid similar catastrophes in the future, it needs independent and effective authorities,"" Greenpeace said in a statement. ""And strong and operative laws which are able to ensure the most important principle of environmental protection 'the polluter pays.'""","Two former executives of an alumina plant in Hungary have been convicted and sentenced to prison for an industrial disaster that killed eight people and injured more than 220 in flooded towns and villages, a Hungarian court said",2019-02-04T18:55:30Z,Convictions issued over Hungary sludge flood that killed 8,ABC News,1
"Boston's Great Molasses Flood was one of the city's deadliest and most bizarre disasters.
A tank containing 2.3 million gallons of molasses buckled, sending a tidal wave of the sticky stuff rampaging through a bustling North End neighborhood exactly 100 years ago Tuesday. Entire buildings were flattened, killing 21 people and injuring 150 others.
The Associated Press was there and published this story on Jan. 15, 1919, the day of the disaster. The toll of dead and injured was not fully known when it appeared.
———
BOSTON, January 15 (AP) Nine persons are known to have been killed and about fifty injured by the explosion of a huge tank of molasses on the water front off Commercial Street, near Keany Square, to-day.
Eight bodies were removed from the wreckage, and one man died at the relief hospital. Most of those injured suffered only from bruises.
The cause of the explosion has not been definitely determined. Walter L. Wedger, explosives expert, said that he was not prepared to give a final opinion, but that it seemed probable it resulted from gas fumes generated by fermenting molasses within the tank, which was not full.
The tank was owned by the Purity Distilling Company.
A dull, muffled roar gave but an instant's warning before the top of the tank was blown into the air. The circular wall broke into two great segments of sheet iron.
Two million gallons of molasses rushed in a mighty stream over the streets, and converted them into a sticky mass, the wreckage of several small buildings smashed by the explosion.
The greatest mortality apparently occurred in one of the buildings of a city storage yard.
One of the sections of the tank wall fell on a fire house, crushing it.
One fireman was killed and two were injured.
The other half of the tank wall crashed against the structure of the Boston elevated railway in Commercial Street, damaging three spans.
Sailors from the United States ship Rockport, at a wharf near-by, were the first to assist after the explosion. They were quickly followed by surgeons of the navy stationed in the vicinity and members of the Red Cross.
A number of horses were killed. The street was strewn with debris, intermixed with molasses, and all traffic was stopped.
Scores of ambulances army, navy, police, hospital and Red Cross were quickly on the scene.
The work was greatly hampered by the oozing flood of molasses which covered the street and the surrounding district to a depth of several inches and slowly drained down into the harbor. To hasten this process the firemen turned on several streams of water. If a worker stood still for a minute he found himself glued to the ground.
A large party of Red Cross workers, women and girls, braved the tangled sticky mass to bring relief to the men. Wearing short skirts and puttees, they waded through the molasses and distributed hot coffee and doughnuts to the firemen, policemen, soldiers and sailors.

"North Dakota's largest city is back in the sandbag-filling business with a new crop of volunteers after a five-year break from warding off major Red River floods.
Fargo officials this week reactivated Sandbag Central, converting a building that normally houses garbage trucks into a systematic operation combining machinery and manpower to fill 24 sandbags every 6 seconds. It saved the city in 2009, when a frantic effort led by middle school, high school and college students cranked out more than 6 million bags to barely hold back a record-setting flood.
The National Weather Service says there's a small chance the river could approach that level this year. So while the city isn't taking any chances, the first day of sandbagging Tuesday was more of a soft opening, in part because Fargo has made numerous changes to reduce its vulnerability and has time on its side. The Red River isn't expected to crest until mid-April.
The cushion is helpful since many of the students and city staff members expected to be instrumental in the effort are entering their first flood fight. That was one reason the city put out a video entitled, ""How to make a Fargo sandbag."" 
Solid waste utility director Terry Ludlum, who leads Sandbag Central, said the operation began this week with ""getting re-acclimated and catching our breath.""
Even so, volunteers produced 96,000 sandbags on the first day, just 4,000 short of their daily goal.
The city originally planned to make 1 million bags. On Friday, it cut that number back to 400,000 after receiving a forecast update from the National Weather Service emphasizing a favorable snow-melt pattern.
Henry Maughan, a Fargo eighth-grader who was part of the first crew to build bags, said he and his fellow students watched videos in class of the intense flood-fighting scene from a decade ago when the city was a foot or two of water from disaster.
""We all want to be here to help keep the city safe,"" the 14-year-old said. ""The attitude is very positive.""
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, of Fargo, cited the long-lingering flood threat across the Midwest that is expected to result in billions of dollars in damages as a prime example of why Fargo cannot be complacent about the looming flood.
""We don't have to look any further than Nebraska or Iowa or Missouri to realize that even when you think you have great flood protection, it still can be topped,"" Burgum said.
The action inside Sandbag Central, which a city official once described as controlled chaos, features sounds of a large bulldozer moving sand into piles, forklifts beeping and the constant whir of conveyer belts on two so-called spider machines. The belts drop sand into a chute at the top of the machine, which then funnels down through 12 metal pipes the spider legs arranged in a circle. One volunteer holds the sandbag as it fills, another spins the bag and another uses a tool to twist on a wire seal.
The sandbags are then stacked on pallets and picked up by forklift drivers who have mastered the art of zigzagging around volunteers, machinery, other pallets and other forklift drivers.
""It's a system that as a volunteer you have to time well with the sand coming off the conveyer belt,"" said Jessica Zimbeck, a Fargo resident making her first appearance at Sandbag Central.
""It's a good workout. I don't have to go to the gym afterward,"" said Derrick Hollingsworth, who drove 40 miles from a small North Dakota town to chip in.
Fargo, a city of about 122,000, has long struggled with flooding due to the flat topography of the Red River Valley. The city's hopes for one day shutting down Sandbag Central for good depend on a $2.75 billion diversion channel to steer water around Fargo. Construction began last year but was halted by permitting issues ; the project is also being challenged in court by upstream landowners whose land will be flooded in times of high water.
The city has spent some $430 million in the past decade on other steps to lessen the threat. More than 21 miles of permanent levees and floodwalls have been built, more than 240 homes on the flood plain have been bought out, and 17 new lift stations have been added to pump water out of storm sewers into the river.
About 52 miles of emergency levees were built in 2009 when the river crested at an all-time high of about 41 feet. Should the river approach 38 feet this time, the city will need 10 miles of temporary protection.
""Certainly we are preparing for somewhat of a worst-case scenario,"" Ludlum said. ""The key to the whole sandbag operation is volunteers.""
One of those volunteers, Steve Vogel, 60, of Fargo, grabbed a shovel and filled bags the old-fashioned way, while declaring that there's nothing wrong with ""getting a little sweat worked up."" Vogel, who has been through all the high water woes in the last 20 years, said it felt all too familiar to be back at Sandbag Central.
""At first it was a little mesmerizing, but now it's just deja vu,"" he said.
Cody Nirschl, who was a North Dakota State University student when he helped in the 2009 effort, said there's an ""amazing sense of volunteer spirit"" and optimism among the people at Sandbag Central about keeping the city dry again this year.
""We've got this in the bag,"" he said.","After a five-year break from warding off numerous major Red River floods, the largest city in North Dakota is back in the sandbag-filling business with a new crop of volunteers",2019-03-29T21:41:58Z,"As flood looms, North Dakota's largest city back to bagging",ABC News,0
"(CNN) A series of storms set to bring some relief to Northern California firefighters Wednesday has thousands of people afraid that flash flooding and mudslides could crush what's left of the towns charred by the devastating Camp Fire. Almost 1 million people are under flash flood watch in Northern California, where 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected to fall through Friday. Nearly two weeks after the deadliest and most destructive fire in the Golden State, the potential downpours could put an end to the fire season or at least ease the fire risk, while also bringing new dangers. ""Rapidly-rising water could flood roads, hampering search efforts and putting displaced residents camping outdoors in peril,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. With the heavy rain on the way, search teams were racing to find remains of the Camp Fire victims, evacuees debated fleeing again and firefighters rushed to remove downed trees and unneeded equipment. The inferno has already killed 81 people and destroyed 12,900 homes. And with hundreds of residents still unaccounted for, authorities fear the death toll could rise. Statewide, 84 people have died in the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire burning west of Los Angeles. Search for missing to be ""much more difficult"" The first bout of heavy rain is expected to hit Butte County, where authorities are scrambling to find 870 people who are unaccounted for since the Camp Fire. When the rain comes, ""It's going to consolidate the material and make it more dense. And it's going to present much more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find that's still there, it's going to make a difficult task... that much more difficult,"" said Brian Ferreira, rescue squad officer for California Task Force 4. In Paradise, a town virtually wiped out by the Camp Fire, the storms will bring about an inch of rain Wednesday and could cause ash flows, or a slurry of ash swept away by rainwater. Ferreira said it's possible some remains could be washed away. If that happens, ""it's out of our hands at that point. We're going to go as hard as we can, as long as we can, until we can't go anymore. That's what's going to happen."" Butte County is keeping a list of the people who are unaccounted for because of the Camp Fire. Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea urged those who see their own names or the names of loved ones found safe to contact the sheriff's office. Evacuees flee, some brace for flooding Across Butte County, residents were bracing for a possible deluge. Jennifer Debrunner is staying at the Butte County Fairgrounds in a motor home loaned by a stranger. She told CNN affiliate KCRA that her family covered everything they own with a tarp. Debrunner said she knows the rain will bring ""a lot of mud, a lot of cold"" to the area. But this Thanksgiving week, Debrunner said she's grateful her family has a borrowed RV. Cady Machado has been camping out in a Walmart parking lot with her husband and 9-month-old baby. Due to the expected rain, Machado told CNN affiliate KTXL, she's sending her child to her sister's in Arizona. As for herself and her husband? ""There's a nice bridge with my name on it to go underneath where I won't get flooded out with my husband,"" she told KTXL. The Red Cross and other aid groups have opened additional shelters for people and pets in the area, KCRA reported. ""We want to make sure those people who are staying in tents know that these spaces are available for them so they can get out of the elements,"" said Shawn Boyd with the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. Officials lifted evacuation orders and warnings for several more areas Tuesday, but cautioned residents ""to take steps to ensure they have food, water and fuel for their vehicles."" Possible mudslides threaten Southern California Rain also is expected in Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire is burning west of Los Angeles. As of Tuesday afternoon, the blaze had killed three people and torched more than 96,000 acres. The Woolsey burn area is expected to get less than an inch of rain. But it's still at risk of mudslides and minor debris flow from Wednesday to Thursday, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. Mudslides are more likely in the Woolsey Fire area because fires in the southern part of the state tend to destroy vegetation roots, Robert Baruffaldi, a meterologist in the National Weather Service's Sacramento office said. Officials in Ventura and Los Angeles counties were urging residents to prepare for the rain. Fire departments in both counties are making an emergency supply of sandbags available to the public at fire stations.

"(CNN) At least seven people, including a young girl, were killed as flash floods engulfed multiple cities in Jordan on Friday. Heavy downpours triggered the flash floods, forcing more than 3,500 international and domestic tourists to be evacuated from the tourist city of Petra in southern Jordan, according to Jumana Ghuneimat, Jordan's minister of state for media affairs and government spokeswoman. Ongoing rainfall in the Daba'a region of southern Jordan also led to the closure of the desert highway in both directions, said Ghuneimat. A large number of vehicles were left stranded as the highway flooded and traffic trapped those attempting to leave. In the Mlaih district of the Madaba governorate, where a young girl was killed when her family's car was swept away by flood waters, rescue teams and divers were on the scene searching for other missing people, Jordan's official Petra news agency reported. Workers were also trying to restore electricity to communities where rainfall caused generators to malfunction, resulting in blackouts. Rescue operations continue across Jordan. So far, 60 people have been rescued and nine transferred to al-Nadeem hospital in Madaba, Ghuneimat said. Authorities have also deployed a drone to search flooded areas for missing people and gauge damage caused by the storm. As search and rescue operations continue, Ghuneimat advised the public to exercise extreme caution and to deal with the weather conditions in a ""very serious manner."" She said the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority (PDTRA) activated early warning systems by using speakers and mosques to warn about the weather conditions and the importance of moving away from flooding areas. Jordan's Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah directed authorities to focus on advancing efforts in rescuing those trapped by the floods. Hassan Al-Qaiam, governor of Madaba, said the Mlaih area has not experienced extreme flooding in many years, according to the Petra news agency. At least 19 people, including schoolchildren on a field trip, were killed by flash floods near Jordan's Dead Sea area last month.

"The Women’s March, which was hailed as an international rebuke of President Trump in 2017 when throngs of activists took the streets the day after his inauguration, is steadily losing supporters amid an anti-Semitism scandal that won't go away.
The march will be held in D.C. again on Saturday at the National Mall, but the controversial ties of organizers have caused the campaign to lose steam. Groups ranging from EMILY’s List to The National Council of Jewish Women as well as high-profile Democratic politicians are keeping their distance, even as other prominent organizations stand by the movement -- and newly announced 2020 candidate Kirsten Gillibrand schedules an appearance at the march's Iowa offshoot.
DNC WILL NOT SPONSOR WOMEN'S MARCH AMID ANTI-SEMITIC CONCERNS
At the center of the controversy are leaders' ties to and statements about radical Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Both Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian activist who has embraced the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and co-President Tamika Mallory have ties to Farrakhan. The controversy picked up after Mallory attended a Farrakhan speech last February.
“White folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God's grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I'm here to say your time is up, your world is through,” Farrakhan said in that sermon.
Sarsour, in particular, has made a number of controversial statements related to Israel. She defended Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., when she was attacked for her support of BDS and said that the criticism was coming from the right-wing as well as “folks who masquerade as progressives but always choose their allegiance to Israel over their commitment to democracy and free speech.”
OPINION: WHY ALL JEWS SHOULD SKIP THE NEXT WOMEN'S MARCH
The controversy caused Teresa Shook, the founder of the Women’s March, to call for the current leaders to step aside in November.
“In opposition to our Unity Principles, they have allowed anti-Semitism, anti-LBGTQIA sentiment and hateful, racist rhetoric to become a part of the platform by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs,” she wrote on Facebook.
She singled out Mallory and Sarsour, as well as members Bob Bland and Carmen Perez.
Last year, a Washington state chapter of the Women's March disbanded in protest because of the national group's links to anti-Semitism. Celebrities Debra Messing and Alyssa Milano also pulled their support from the march last year.
“Any time that there is any bigotry or anti-Semitism in that respect, it needs to be called out and addressed. I’m disappointed in the leadership of the Women’s March that they haven’t done it adequately,” Milano said in a statement to The Advocate in October.
Lengthy reports in Tablet and The New York Times, which spelled out allegations of anti-Semitism, further fueled the fire. While the group’s leaders have denounced anti-Semitism, an apparent reluctance to condemn Farrakhan personally has led to further problems.
Sarsour told The Washington Post that the leaders reject Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic, homophobic and transphobic statements. But she didn’t specifically denounce Farrakhan, saying she has never met him and the organization believes in “attacking the forces of evil” and not individuals.
WOMEN'S MARCH 2019 CELEBRITY SPEAKERS, LOCATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW
“I say to all my Jewish sisters that you are welcome, and we have a common enemy that is white supremacy,” Sarsour said.
On Monday, Mallory and Bland appeared on “The View” and said they condemn anti-Semitism. But when co-host Meghan McCain asked if Mallory condemned Farrakhan's statements, Mallory (who called him the ""greatest of all time because of what he’s done in black communities"") clarified that she “does not agree” with his statements.
“You won’t condemn it,” McCain pointed out.
Soon after that, The Democratic National Committee removed itself from the organization’s list of sponsors.
""The DNC stands in solidarity with all those fighting for women's rights and holding the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers across the country accountable. Women are on the front lines of fighting back against this administration and are the core of our Democratic Party,"" DNC Deputy Communications Director Sabrina Singh told Fox News, making clear the organization still supports the cause of women's rights even as it keeps distance from the group itself.
According to The Daily Beast, EMILY’s List, The National Council of Jewish Women and the Southern Poverty Law Center are among the groups who have pulled their support.
LIST OF 2019 WOMEN'S MARCH SPONSORS
Yet many groups are still backing the march, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood. The ACLU did not respond to a request for comment, while Planned Parenthood referred Fox News to a blog post in which it said there was ""no place for anti-Semitism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, or any kind of bigotry in our communities, our movement, and our country.""
""Specifically: Louis Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic, homophobic and transphobic remarks stand in opposition to our commitment to equity and justice and the work Planned Parenthood health centers do everyday to provide non-judgmental, quality health care to anyone who needs it,"" the post said.
Lawmakers also appeared to be distancing themselves from the march.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., wrote in a USA Today op-ed that ""sadly, I must walk away from the national Women’s March organization, and specifically its leadership. While I still firmly believe in its values and mission, I cannot associate with the national march’s leaders and principles, which refuse to completely repudiate anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. I cannot walk shoulder to shoulder with leaders who lock arms with outspoken peddlers of hate.""
She noted she still plans to ""join a movement of women around the nation who are participating in local marches that have distanced themselves from those national Women’s March leaders who still ally with bigotry.""
New York State Assemblywoman Amy Paulin put out a statement saying that she would not be participating and made reference to the Farrakhan controversy.
""I have dedicated my public career to fighting for equality. But to my mind, you can't fight against equality and discrimination for women but support it for Jews,"" she said.
In Congress, Buzzfeed News reported that Democrats eyeing 2020 bids are steering clear of the event. The outlet got no response from aides to former Vice President Joe Biden, Julian Castro, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Sen. Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who announced her run this week, is one candidate who is still supporting the movement -- by attending a march in Iowa this weekend. Her campaign reportedly said she condemns anti-Semitism, but ""will not turn her back on the thousands of Iowa women who are joining this locally organized march to advocate for the issues that deeply impact them and their families.""
Meanwhile, spokespersons for Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., said that they would not be attending.

"(CNN) With rain falling and more expected, Walmart is encouraging people to leave the temporary encampment that sprung up in one of its parking lots as the Camp Fire burned through northern California. ""The weather forecast from the National Weather Service showing steady rain continuing through Friday has heightened our existing concerns and increased the urgency to find a more sustainable solution,"" company spokeswoman Delia Garcia said. ""We are asking the remaining individuals to evacuate the property and transition to more appropriate shelter."" The Walmart parking lot in Chico became an immediate refuge for Butte County residents fleeing the deadly blaze. Located about 10 minutes down the hill from the town of Paradise, which bore the brunt of the Camp Fire's wrath, it was a familiar place to settle for evacuees with no other options. What began as a temporary shelter turned into a makeshift village. Volunteers distributed supplies such as smoke masks, dog food, clothes and other essentials. Authorities began raising concerns last week that the onset of heavy rain could cause unsafe conditions. With more than 151,000 acres of newly scorched earth, heavy rain expected this week could lead to flooding and mudslides. Almost 1 million people are under flash flood watch in the region, where 4 to 6 inches of rain is expected to fall through Friday. Rain began in Paradise about 11 a.m. Wednesday, dropping nearly a half inch within a few hours. A break was expected before it resumes by evening. Walmart's tent city was not designed for long-term housing -- it has no running water for basic facilities such as toilets or showers. And now, more shelters and housing options are available than in the early days of the wildfire. ""We continue to be concerned about the health, safety and well-being of the individuals remaining on our property and have been working cooperatively with city, county and state officials and local non-profits to increase capacity at local shelters and help create good temporary housing options,"" Garcia said.

"(CNN) A significant winter storm will take shape beginning Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas, then spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Winter storm watches are already in place Thursday for 6 million people in northern Texas, Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas and Missouri. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: F riday morning through Saturday evening The primary precipitation will begin Friday, with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. The main winter weather impacts will occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight Friday for places including Oklahoma City. Precipitation in eastern Oklahoma won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Flooding rain, ice and snow Ice accumulations in Texas and Oklahoma could reach one-quarter to one-half inch, respectively. Snowfall in these areas could also top 6 inches. Expect dangerous travel conditions and power outages. Oklahoma City is expected to get one-10th to one-quarter of an inch of ice, plus 4 to 6 inches of snow. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see less ice and snow, with ice accumulations near one-10th of an inch and snow of 2 to 3 inches. In Texas, the wintry weather will stay in the panhandle and the Red River Valley. Large amounts of rain will impact major Texas cities, including Dallas and Houston. More than 13 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch in eastern Texas. Cities like San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches and isolated spots could see as much as 10 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most of Arkansas won't feel the precipitation until later Friday, with some rain early in the south and central portions of the state. Winter weather won't begin until the overnight hours and will transition eastward Saturday morning. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with flash flooding possible. The Arkansas-Louisiana-Texas region could see 4 to 5 inches of rain. Winter precipitation will be likely on Saturday morning and through the day Saturday in Arkansas and western Tennessee, mostly north of Interstate 40. One forecast model shows colder air filtering a bit further south, potentially impacting Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis. Right now, Little Rock looks like it will pick up a maximum 1 inch, with little or no accumulation possible. Fayetteville and Bentonville, in Arkansas, meantime, will see 3 to 4 inches. In the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains, 6 to 8 inches of snow is possible on top of a small glaze of ice to one-quarter inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where 1 to 2 inches is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation begins to creep into the region early Saturday morning, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. From there, things get interesting. The situation will begin to pick up Saturday afternoon, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix A significant amount of snow across the mountains of North Carolina, South Carolina and northeast Georgia is expected but not certain. If warmer air mixes in, it could lessen the amount of snow that accumulates. It all depends on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" -- when cold air is forced from the northeast and pushes against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. This shallow layer of cold air allows for freezing temperatures to remain near the surface as warmer, moist air moves over it. If the air column stays cold enough near the surface and extends high enough into the atmosphere, moisture will fall as snow. If air above freezing gets into the middle layer, there is a greater chance for ice pellets or even a wintry mix. Right now, most forecast models show this lasting through the weekend and into early Monday. Early snow estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet across the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. This means portions of North Carolina could see record snowfall. ""This could be a once-in-a-generation event for areas that experience mostly snow and ice,"" the National Weather Service in Greenville, South Carolina, said Thursday. There is even the possibility on Sunday afternoon for blizzard conditions in the higher elevations of the Appalachians. North Carolina cities impacted by wintry precipitation will be Asheville, Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte. The amount of snow in areas east of I-85 largely depends on how established the cold-air damming, also called ""the wedge"" in this region, becomes. ""(We) will hold of(f) on getting too cute with any snow amounts at this time given the degree of uncertainty and how the varying p(recipitation) types would impact accumulations,"" the National Weather Service in Raleigh said Thursday. While most models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, there is one model that shows the possibility of freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor to impact Atlanta on Sunday night into Monday. The storm moves out to sea Monday, models showed Thursday. It also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas, though this seems unlikely. CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett contributed to this report.","A significant winter storm will take shape beginning Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas, then spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.",2018-12-06T18:39:21Z,Snow to blanket the South this weekend in major winter storm,CNN,1
"Walt Disney World Resort is  globally renowned as the Vacation Kingdom of the World, the location of four legendary theme parks, a year-round home of top-flight entertainment, and a destination filled with every resort amenity a visitor could wish forbut its role and history as an engineering and construction marvel, and as a masterpiece of development balanced with environmental responsibility is seldom discussed.
That the Walt Disney World site was swamp and scrub pine as far as the eye could see is well-known in Disney history. Although Magic
 Kingdom Park and the first phase of resort development opened in October 1971, site preparation began in October of 1965and one of the first creations was not a hotel, a castle, or a monorailit was a beautiful lagoon, surrounded by white sand beaches!
Since its very beginnings, the property and its waterways have been key to the maintenance of the overall ecology of the entire property. The high water table and fragile environment of Florida demanded an enormous infrastructural preparation, including 55 miles of canals and levees for flood control, and to manage and exchange water levels without depleting the overall reserve. This remarkable control system functions automatically, without electricity, based on water levels.
Detail of a vintage fun map with Seven Seas Lagoon in the spotlight. ©Disney
Bay Lake is a natural body of water that was already located on-property, but it was filthy with root structures, silt, muck, and decades of debris. It was drained and cleaned to make it suitable for the millions of visitors expected to flock to Florida. Nearby, more than seven million cubic yards of earth was moved to create a man-made body of waterSeven Seas Lagoon.
Site surveying had determined that the lagoon site was unstable and unsuitable for construction, so an innovative and imaginative plan for the location was to make it a sort of aquatic red carpeta unique and sparkling forecourt to Magic Kingdom Park. Behind the lagoon, a nine-acre ground-level floor level for the park itself was constructed, comprised of a network of corridors and huge work and storage rooms. Called (in typical Imagineering style) utilidors, they provide out of sight access to all the backstage services and activities of Magic Kingdom Park.
The earth removed for the creation of the lagoon was relocated to cover the utilidor level of the park. Magic Kingdom Park guests seldom realize that they are actually on the second floor of the park.
Underneath the roots and muck of Bay Lake, tons of pure white sand was discovered. When the dredging and construction work for the waterways was completed, and the lake and lagoon filled with water, this beautiful, natural dividend was used to create the charming beaches around the lagoonand the gorgeous tropical setting for one of the opening day resort hotels, the Polynesian Village.
There are three small islands in Seven Seas LagoonBlackbeard Island, Castaway Cay (just like the Disney Cruise Line private island in the Bahamas), and Beachcomber Island. Castaway Cay has been used as the launching point for perimeter fireworks and is closest to Magic
 Kingdom Park. The island near the water bridge that connects Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake is known as Blackbeard Island. Closest to the Polynesian and Grand Floridian, covered with trees and grasses, is Beachcomber Island, once home to an unusual piece of recreation technology.
A beautiful white sand beach without surfing seemed idiosyncratic to then-Vice President of Park Operations Dick Nunis, he spearheaded the concept of surfing as a recreational activity for guests. An artificial wave machine was installed on the shore of Beachcomber Island (at a cost of nearly half a million dollars), and quickly proved its valueriding the waves on the Seven Seas Lagoon quickly became a  favorite resort activity. But with the waves came an unexpected and negative resultbeach erosion. The picturesque waves pulled the picturesque white sand away from the beach and to the bottom of the lagoon.
In addition, the unpredictable wave action on the relatively placid lagoon created navigational problems for the several of the craft on the water nearby. Additionally, the wave-making machinery proved technologically temperamental, and costly to operate and maintain.
After only a few years, the wave machine was shut downbut not removed. It sat rather inelegantly on the shore of Beachcomber Island, across from the Polynesian for more than a decade. In 1985, it was felt that perhaps the lagoon and beaches had been able to settle, and perhaps the beach damage would no longer happen. The wave machine was refurbished and started up, but the controlled waves still pulled the beach away.
The wave machine was removed, but remnants of the wall to which the machine was attached can still be seen on the shoreline of Beachcomber Island today, and its said that the machinery out of sight, below the lagoon surface, was simply left behind, because of the huge cost to remove it completely.
Luckily, the loss of the surfing beach didnt harm the unnatural natural beauty of the remarkable Seven Seas Lagoon, a modern miracle of Imagineeringand luckily, there was plenty more to do on the resort waterways adjacent to Magic Kingdom Park.

"Two former South Carolina sheriff's deputies were arrested Friday after two women in their transport van died when they were swept away in Hurricane Florence floodwaters, officials said.
Joshua Bishop, 29, has been charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, and Stephen Flood, 66, has been charged with two counts of reckless homicide and two counts of involuntary manslaughter, said the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), which is investigating the case.
The Horry County Sheriff's deputies, Bishop and Flood, were assigned to transport the two women, both mental health patients, for treatment on Sept. 18 as water levels were rising from the deadly hurricane, SLED said.
The deputies were told by another officer that a certain route wouldn't be passable because of the water, but Flood took that route anyway, and he drove right into floodwaters, SLED claimed.
Two mental health patients drowned when the Little Pee Dee River near Mullins, S.C., overflowed its banks and the van they were traveling in flooded on Sept. 18, 2018.
Their van stalled out and was swept across the road and up against a guardrail, SLED said, and then the road under them washed away and the van sank into a hole.
Bishop escaped and tried to rescue the women, who couldn't open the doors from inside, but he wasn't able to, according to SLED.
Bishop was able to save Flood and a boat later rescued the officers, SLED said.
From left, Stephen Flood and Joshua Bishop are pictured in this undated photos released by Horry County Sheriff's Office.
Both women, Wendy Newton and Nicolette Green, drowned, SLED said.
Bishop and Flood were fired in October, Brooke Holden, spokeswoman for the Horry County Sheriffs Office, told ABC News. She declined to comment further, deferring to SLED.
Bishop and Flood surrendered Friday morning to SLED agents at the Marion County Detention Center, SLED spokesman Thom Berry told ABC News. They had a bond hearing following booking, Berry said.
Flood's attorney, Allie Argoe, said her client served with the military police in Massachusetts for 14 years before moving to South Carolina in 2007 where he spent 10 years with Horry County law enforcement.
Argoe declined to comment on the case but said her client has not entered a plea.
Bishop entered a not guilty plea, his attorney, Bert von Herrmann, told ABC News.
The attorney called the incident a ""horrible tragedy"" but said his client ""was a passenger transporting them. He wasn't a decision maker. He was actually the junior person who was on duty.""

"(CNN)The nation's tallest dam reopened Tuesday, more than two years after its main spillway failed and forced nearly 200,000 people to evacuate their homes, authorities announced. 
Construction crews have been working to rebuild the Oroville Dam in Northern California since then, and have restored its ""full functionality,"" said Joel Ledesma, deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources.
Authorities said they will be closely monitoring the dam's operations as it faces its first big test since its collapse.
Powerful storms across California in February 2017 caused Lake Oroville's water level to rise and overflow the dam. The water could not be drained fast enough, and the dam's main spillway -- which catches excess water when Lake Oroville's water level rises to overflow the dam -- had developed a hole the size of a football field and 40 feet deep due to erosion.
For the first time in the nearly 50 years since it was built, water was diverted into the emergency spillway, which was covered with brush, trees and rock. As millions of gallons of water washed over the emergency spillway, it eroded further.
Authorities feared that the spillway would fail and send water downstream. 
They ordered evacuations in the nearby town of Oroville, which is about 75 miles north of Sacramento. The 770 feet dam provides flood control for the region.
It's been an unusually wet winter in California, and more storms are likely coming later in the week.
State officials said they need to use the spillway to control the rising water in Lake Oroville -- one of the state's key reservoirs. 
Ledesma said authorities are ""operating the reservoir to ensure public safety of those downstream.""
The Lake Oroville reservoir is currently 81% full at 854 feet, according to DWR's estimates. 
The water began flowing Tuesday when the gates at the top of the dam were opened.
The Department of Water Resources says it expects to initially be releasing 8,300 cubic feet per second. The spillway has been rebuilt to handle water flowing at a rate of 270,000 cubic feet of water per second, significantly more than officials would ever expect to release. 
Crews have installed temporary cameras and lights along the spillway, so they can monitor the water around the clock as it flows down the chute. 
Why do officials think it won't collapse again?
Built in the 1960s, the dam lacked modern enhancements and hadn't been properly fortified, according to a report by a panel of independent investigators released after the dam collapsed. The panel blamed the problem on ""long-term systemic failure,"" including issues with the original design. 
And a Sacramento environmental group said they had urged officials to reinforce the spillway in 2005 because it didn't meet modern safety standards.
Officials have expressed confidence that the repairs -- costing more than $1 billion -- will avert any potential crisis.
""The Oroville main spillway was designed and constructed using 21st century engineering practices and under the oversight and guidance from state and federal regulators and independent experts, "" Ledesma said.
The renovation is considered the biggest and fastest construction project in state history. It required enough concrete to fill more than 370 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
During the two phases of the repair, crews worked to cover the spillway with structural concrete, install cutoff walls on the sides and reinforce the concrete with 12.4 million pounds of steel, officials said. 
Ron Stork, policy director of the conservationist nonprofit Friends of the River and a flood management expert, said he doesn't anticipate immediate problems with the dam but believes more repairs need to be done. 
""They've got many hundreds of millions of dollars if not more of work yet to be done,"" he said.
The strength of a secondary emergency spillway could be an issue, Stork said, as well as potentially broken and cracked ""anchor tendons"" that are integral for raising and lowering the spillway gates.
The main spillway is prepared to reopen, water resources officials said, and work on the emergency spillway is expected to be finished later this year.

"(CNN)While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, folks there shouldn't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter's never over till it's over. 
The potential is there for a ""bomb cyclone"" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. 
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. 
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb-cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. 
Blizzard conditions likely for many
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop nearly 40 degrees in just 12 hours, including in Denver -- which is expecting a high of 80 degrees Tuesday and near blizzard conditions by Wednesday night. 
Winter storm warnings and watches stretch from the Rockies to the Great Lakes.
There are blizzard warnings for three-quarters of a million people in western Nebraska, South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota. 
Up to 2 feet of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-55 mph across South Dakota and Nebraska, along with white-out conditions.
A potentially historic winter storm
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow and wind. A foot of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis, where forecasters are calling for ""a potentially historic winter storm."" 
Winds will gust up to 45mph.
While an April snowstorm seems like a punch in the gut, April snowstorms do happen. Just last year, the Twin Cities experienced their top April snowstorm with 15.8 inches of snow April 13-16, 2018.
Air travel will become drastically slow, and road travel will be treacherous. Expect to stay put once the snow gets going. 
Severe storms could strike to the south of system
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. 
Large hail, damaging winds and perhaps a tornado are likely with some of the storms. On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, with the main threat of damaging winds.
High wind and possible fire danger are another big concern
With all this talk of snow and cold, we might as well add fire to the mix.
Red flag warnings cover over 4 million people from southeastern Arizona, through much of New Mexico into eastern Colorado Tuesday, where the combination of strong winds, low relative humidity and very warm to hot temperatures will create critical fire weather conditions. 
Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly and will be hard to control.
High wind watches and warnings extend from California into Texas and Oklahoma. Wind gusts of up to 60 to 70 mph are expected in the Mountains outside of Los Angeles, with gusts up to 60 mph in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Scattered power outages are likely over much of the Southwest.
The fire risk is even worse Wednesday, with extreme fire danger -- the highest category -- from New Mexico into West Texas.
Flood threat to places drenched by last bomb cyclone
Flooding in the already hard-hit Plains will be exacerbated due to the additional precipitation.
The rain that moves in ahead of the snow in South Dakota and Nebraska could cause some immediate flood concerns, whereas the amount of fresh snow across the Plains and Midwest will be a more long-term threat.
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding as this additional snow will slow the rate at which waters recede.
The Red River is experiencing significant flooding because of melting snow with this new storm likely prolonging the high water.
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry up and stay.

"Get the Think newsletter. SUBSCRIBE Nov. 6, 2018 / 11:46 AM GMT By Evan McMullin, Former presidential candidate and co-founder of Stand Up Republic In just a few hours, America will learn the results of the midterm elections amid the rising crescendo of partisan rancor and anxiety. Republicans are hoping to maintain power while Democrats pray for a blue wave. But no matter the outcome, patriotic Americans should be ready post-election for President Donald Trump to escalate his struggle to break American democracy. For the past two years, I and others working to strengthen bipartisan commitment to essential ideals and institutions have witnessed diverse Americans uniting for the cause. They are truly an encouraging harbinger of a future, strengthened republic. Together, these Republicans, Democrats and independents have helped defeat extremists like Roy Moore in Alabama, elect unifiers like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, and uphold the basic truth that all are created equal, even in the face of Trump-inspired, nationalist violence. Trump has recently returned to a familiar playbook the promise of a conservative Supreme Court and xenophobic rhetoric to divide as many Americans as possible. Today, I hope they will provide the crucial votes in the most important midterm races. Yet Trump has recently returned to a familiar playbook the promise of a conservative Supreme Court and xenophobic rhetoric to divide as many Americans as possible with fear, tribalism and Faustian bargains in hopes that they abandon the defense of our democracy. A Democratic majority in the House or Senate is critical to reestablishing effective separation of powers and needed oversight over the Trump administration. But whether or not Democrats succeed, Trump will likely escalate his efforts to smash limits to his power. My service with the Central Intelligence Agency taught me that leaders committed to self-preservation through authoritarianism do not curtail their efforts to dismantle checks on their power under the threat of accountability. They hasten them. If Republicans hold the House and Senate, Trump will see evidence of national vulnerability. Emboldened, he will act more aggressively against threats to his presidency, including the special counsels investigation and Congressional consideration of its findings. If Republicans hold the House and Senate, Trump will see evidence of national vulnerability. Emboldened, he will act more aggressively. If, on the other hand, the Democrats prevail in at least one chamber, Trump will not stand idly as oversight committees and the law encircle him. He will fear the consequences of his inaction more than those of any potential action. I sincerely hope that Im wrong, but Trump has given us no reason to expect otherwise. He is prepared for this moment and we are not at least not yet. In the months ahead, Trump and his far-right media allies will more thoroughly flood the country with conspiracies, lies and other disinformation to impede our ability to discern the truth about his corruption. Many well-intentioned Americans will probably succumb, resolving to refocus on matters closer to home, including family, work and friendships. He will continue to allow and even normalize foreign disinformation in his favor, which will become more sophisticated, effective and increasingly encouraged and mimicked by his loyalists. He will more brazenly pursue nationalist, illiberal policies to energize the far-right in order to maintain control over the GOP and provoke a more radical response from the far-left, which he will in turn use to justify additional anti-democratic measures. If the Democrats win the House, Trump will frame their appropriate oversight as treason, sheer partisanship and personal hostility, exploiting any overreaches or missteps as evidence of his false narrative. This in turn will encourage his followers utter contempt for evidence of his wrongdoing. He will promote the idea that the midterm election was rigged and allege the illegitimacy of our democratic processes more regularly to inspire the public apathy will help suppress opposition voting in the future. He will likely remove Attorney General Jeff Sessions to gain influence over Department of Justice investigations, which the presidents Democratic opposition will tolerate due to their unwillingness to bear Sessions flaws long enough to protect relevant probes. He will more frequently claim a national security rationale for his actions and may, possibly with a new set of less independent defense advisors, exploit real crises to suspend basic freedoms and silence dissent. Most importantly, he will do whatever he can to use our greatest fears, frustrations and ambitions to turn us against each other, because uniting on higher ground in defense of the nation presents the greatest threat to him. Trumps hostility to our values and institutions is not a partisan problem; it is an American problem. We must recognize it as such and act accordingly. Conservatives must begin to measure everything Trump does first by its impact on the health of the republic, not by partisan priorities. No party goal is more important than the protection of our liberty. Not one. Democrats must realize that a conservatives agreement with Trump on some policy matters does not indicate that they are part of the far-right, white nationalist movement; many still harbor serious concerns about the president. Though our political parties are increasingly divided, America as a whole is not. Most of us are still united by our commitment to liberty, equality and truth. In the next chapter of this presidency, our willingness to put these values first will define our future, whether it be free or otherwise.

"An Arizona woman who may have become overwhelmed caring for her twin 8-year-old autistic grandsons told authorities she fatally shot the boys before attempting suicide, according to court documents.
Dorothy Flood, 55, remained jailed Monday on suspicion of two counts of first-degree murder. It was unclear if she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf. She was being held on a $250,000 bond and faces an April 15 preliminary hearing.
Flood was the boys' sole caregiver after their mother died in 2017, according to Tucson authorities. A possible motive remains unclear, but a former co-worker said Flood may have been overwhelmed by the demands of caring for the children.
""You could see the fear that she had of the future,"" Chandra McCord told TV station KOLD. ""She was afraid she wasn't going to be able to handle it.""
Pima County sheriff's officials said in court documents they believe Flood will try to kill herself again if she's released.
Flood was arrested last Friday, a day after the boys were found dead inside a home in northwest Tucson.
An interim complaint filed by the sheriff's department said both Jaden and Jorden Webb were shot multiple times.
Authorities found Flood with symptoms of an apparent overdose from taking an unknown quantity of prescription medication. She was brought to a hospital for treatment and later taken into custody.

"This is a developing story. To follow our ongoing coverage, click here.
 (CNN)The studio and network behind Fox's ""Empire"" say they are considering their options, following the arrest of television actor Jussie Smollett. 
""We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CNN on Thursday. ""We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""
The company's statement came hours after Smollett was arrested on suspicion of filing a false report. 
Chicago police allege Smollett paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack on him last month. 
Smollett had told police that on Jan. 29 he was attacked by two people who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck, and poured an unknown substance on him. 
The incident prompted a flood of support for Smollett from all corners of Hollywood, including his ""Empire"" co-stars and producers. 
The actor has denied playing a role in his attack. His attorneys promised an ""aggressive defense,"" in a statement issued Wednesday after Cook County State's Attorney's Office approved a felony disorderly conduct charge against Smollett.
""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" his attorneys said.
Investigators believe Smollett orchestrated the attack, in part, ""because he was dissatisfied with his salary,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said Thursday.
Smollett has starred on Fox's ""Empire"" since 2015. He plays Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family. Like his character, Smollett identifies as gay.
Early on Wednesday, before official charges had been made against Smollett, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox TV stood by Smollett saying he continued ""to be a consummate professional on set"" and assuring that ""he is not being written out of the show.""

"(CNN)As the Trump administration recalls tens of thousands of government workers to restart operations previously closed during the partial shutdown, one expert says the law allows fairly wide latitude to decide which government functions are essential. 
On Thursday, the State Department announced that its employees would return to work in the coming days. 
Alice Rivlin, who directed the Office of Management and Budget under the Clinton administration, said the guidelines were not particularly clear and that officials could revisit their assessments as shutdowns dragged on. 
""The law itself is pretty vague,"" Rivlin told CNN. ""It's a question of what's essential and what isn't. ... In the end it's a judgment call."" 
The Antideficiency Act, which guides many of the decisions around a government shutdown, provides this broad guideline: ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property."" It does specify that language cannot be used to justify ""ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property."" 
Those decisions are generally the domain of the Office of Management and Budget. 
""Our mission from the President has been to make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law,"" Russ Vought, the current deputy director of OMB, told reporters earlier this month. 
He ticked off some of the administration's adjustments to make that happen, such as recalling IRS workers to process tax refunds, reversing plans to stop issuing flood insurance policies and bringing back rangers to clean up national parks. 
""In some cases, activities and performance would not qualify for continuation during a very brief funding lapse ... but they would qualify if the duration of the funding lapse became longer,"" reads a December guide from OMB to federal agencies. 
Rivlin, who led OMB during a 21-day shutdown that had been the longest until the current one surpassed it, said she believed it was appropriate to include flexibility in the laws and guidelines, as it allowed the administration to adapt as circumstances changed. 
She had urged her Clinton administration colleagues to make decisions that visually reminded Americans that their government was closed, such as by cutting power to the National Christmas Tree. 
""I said I didn't think the Christmas tree was essential. That one got a lot of screams and a lot of volunteers"" to keep it lit and operating, she said. ""I thought that was unfortunate. I thought we wanted to make as clear as possible that the shutdown was inconveniencing people.""","As the Trump administration recalls tens of thousands of government workers to restart operations previously closed during the partial shutdown, one expert says the law allows fairly wide latitude to decide which government functions are essential.",2019-01-17T23:28:30Z,What's essential and what's not in a shutdown?

"From the Central Plains to the Midwest, it has been a disastrous spring for river flooding. A weather system slated to bring more heavy rains Friday into Saturday could aggravate the situation along and near the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.
Its a one-two punch that combines additional rainwater with fresh runoff from snowmelt. Perhaps worst off is Nebraska, in the direct path of Fridays quick burst of moisture. Barely a week has passed since Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts estimated the cost of ongoing flooding at more than $1 billion. 
 In a waterlogged state that needs anything but more water, Fridays precipitation could tip the scale and pose additional danger in many vulnerable locations.
Between a quarter and a half inch of total moisture can be expected in Nebraska, falling primarily as snow in the west as temperatures plummet behind a cold front.
Farther east, its all rain in Omaha, and will stay that way.
In Iowa, the rain will be confined to the states southern half; about a third of an inch can be expected. Rainfall amounts could be maximized between Interstate 70 and 35 in Kansas, where a bullseye of three quarters to one inch could end up being the case. 
Areas northeast of Wichita/Hutchinson into Missouri are favored for the heaviest out of this storm. Flood watches are out for much of west central and central Missouri through Saturday morning, where one to two and half inches could fall.
The Missouri River is already at moderate flood stage in a number of spots from Saint Joseph to Kansas City, and will remain at hazardous levels until at least the beginning of next week.
As of Friday afternoon, the National Weather Service reported 39 river gauges were reporting major flooding, and another 73 moderate flooding in the nations mid-section.
[NOAA warns of unprecedented spring flood season that may become more dire in coming weeks]
Its not just rainfall thats posing an issue. A series of meteorological mood swings will continue to exacerbate flood concerns, melting snow in short, rapid bursts. That sudden influx of additional water will be anything but gradual, reinvigorating ongoing flooding while leaving the ground sodden and saturated.
North Platte, Neb. hit a record 76 degrees Wednesday, and could end up with half a foot of snow by the end of Friday. Despite temperatures hovering around freezing tomorrow, a sudden warmup will spike temperatures to above 50 on Monday. With a high sun angle characteristic of March, that snow will be fried within hours much of it funneling through the Sand Hills downwards into tributaries of the Missouri.

"Severe flooding in Northern California has turned the small river town of Guerneville into an island, county officials said Wednesday, rendering the community inaccessible by anything other than watercraft.
In an update to an evacuation notice Wednesday morning, the county reminded area residents that even though rains have eased, the worst of the flooding is yet to come. The Russian River surpassed its flood stage in the town Tuesday evening, resulting in dozens of road closures, and is expected to crest Wednesday night.
In addition to Guerneville, 24 nearby towns and communities were also ordered to evacuate. Flood levels are expected to decrease Thursday and into the weekend, according to the National Weather Service.
Good morning. Guerneville is officially an island, the Sonoma sheriffs office posted to Facebook on Wednesday. Due to flooding all roads leading to the community are impassable. You will not be able to get into or out of town without a boat today. 
The floods were caused by record-breaking rainfall in the region, according to the Weather Service. The Sonoma sheriffs office has urged residents to heed evacuation warnings, writing Wednesday afternoon that roads keep flooding, and flooding FAST. 
The rain, winds and flooding were spurred by a potent atmospheric river, the Weather Service said. 
Atmospheric rivers develop when strong storms pull very humid air from the tropical Pacific Ocean to the West Coast. The result is a fire hose of extreme rainfall that can trigger dangerous flooding and deadly landslides. Theyre most common during the winter, and the effects are exacerbated when heavy rain falls on burn scars from recent wildfires.
Parts of the Sonoma region were impacted by the deadly wildfires that ravaged Northern California in 2017, resulting in mass evacuations and the deaths of dozens in surrounding counties. At least six people died in Sonoma County.
Those who have opted to wait out the storm in their homes could be stuck for days, the Los Angeles Times reports. The newspaper reports that this is expected to be the most severe flood in the area since 1995, when the Russian River crested in Guerneville at about 48 feet 16 feet above its flood stage.
The river is expected to crest at just over 46 feet Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service.
In Monte Rio, a town about five miles south of Guerneville, firefighters worked overnight to help people trapped in their vehicles and homes as water levels rose, the AP reports. Fire Chief Steve Baxman told the Press Democrat that rescuers took 17 people out of cars and houses during the night. 
Too many people are driving into the water, he told the publication.

By Daniel Arkin and Claire Atkinson
In the hours after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos publicly accused the National Enquirer's parent company of ""extortion and blackmail,"" prominent names in journalism and one Hollywood star alleged the tabloid giant had tried to intimidate or threaten them, too.
The allegations could put even more scrutiny on American Media and its chief executive, David Pecker, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Pecker has been accused of buying controversial stories about Trump to keep them private a media industry practice known as ""catch and kill.""
Investigative journalist Ronan Farrow said in a tweet Thursday night that he and ""at least one other prominent journalist"" who had reported on the link between the National Enquirer and Trump received what he characterized as ""stop digging or we'll ruin you"" blackmail threats from AMI.
""I did not engage as I don't cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting,"" Farrow said in the tweet.
In a direct response to Farrow's tweet, former Associated Press investigative editor Ted Bridis said: ""We were warned explicitly by insiders that AMI had hired private investigators to dig into backgrounds of @AP journalists looking into the tabloid's efforts on behalf of Trump.""
Bridis added: ""Never saw evidence of this either way, and it didn't stop our reporting.""
We were warned explicitly by insiders that AMI had hired private investigators to dig into backgrounds of @AP journalists looking into the tabloids efforts on behalf of Trump. Never saw evidence of this either way, and it didnt stop our reporting.
 Ted Bridis (@tbridis) February 8, 2019
In a separate tweet about the allegations Bezos made in his post on the blogging site Medium, Bridis said AMI, the National Enquirer and its lawyers ""tried to shut down public interest reporting on tabloid's work on behalf of Trump.""
In an article published Thursday night, the Daily Beast's Lachlan Markay reported that the publication and ""a member of its staff were threatened by AMI's attorneys."" The article did not characterize the alleged threats in detail.
""Imagine if Pecker and his pals put as much effort into getting scoops as they do into threatening people,"" Daily Beast editor in chief Noah Shachtman told NBC News on Friday. ""It's the latest reminder as if we needed one that there's nothing too low for this crowd.""
AMI said in a statement Friday that its board would investigate Bezos' allegations but that the company believed it acted lawfully. A company spokesperson declined to comment further.
One notable accusation against AMI came from outside the news industry. The actor Terry Crews tweeted that AMI allegedly tried to ""silence"" him as well:
This same company, AMI, tried to silence me in my lawsuit against @wme and Adam Venit by fabricating stories of me with prostitutes and even went so far as creating fake receipts.
I called their bluff by releasing their threats online. They blinked. https://t.co/S6lMZ5K6Tb
 terry crews (@terrycrews) February 8, 2019
Crews has alleged that William Morris Endeavor agent Adam Venit grabbed and squeezed his crotch at a 2016 party. Venit denied the allegation in court documents. Crews and Venit agreed to settle the actor's civil lawsuit in September. Venit did not admit to the allegations but did take responsibility for the situation in a letter of apology to Crews.
The flood of accusations against AMI recalled a 2017 op-ed, published in the Washington Post, by MSNBC ""Morning Joe"" co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, who said that ""top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked.""
""We ignored their desperate pleas,"" the MSNBC anchors wrote.
The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, has reported exhaustively on Trump, including the ongoing federal investigations into his 2016 presidential campaign and administration. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Post and Bezos, suggesting that the Amazon chief was using the newspaper as a political weapon.
Pecker's ties to Trump stirred speculation that the National Enquirer's investigation of Bezos' extra-marital affair with Lauren Sanchez, who is now his girlfriend, was politically motivated. Pecker's link to Trump has been the focus of extensive reporting and an investigation by federal prosecutors.
According to the emails that Bezos published on Medium, which have not been independently reviewed by NBC News, AMI threatened to publish texts from Bezos and Sanchez that included photos of a sexual nature.
In exchange for withholding the photos, AMI demanded that Bezos stop the Post from reporting on the alleged political motivations behind its initial reporting on his relationship with Sanchez.
Bert Fields, an entertainment lawyer who has represented a variety of celebrities, including Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman, said he has battled with AMI before.
""I had many, many, many encounters as you can imagine with American Media,"" Fields said. ""Ive had really good relationships with their General Counsel who I thought acted reasonably. I cant say the same for the management of the company. Ive had numerous fights were them.
Fields added the Bezos letter goes beyond what he's seen from the company in the past.
""In some instances, weve had an informal agreement when they are going to publish something bad about a particular client, they would check the story with me,"" Fields said. ""But thats their general counsel, as distinguished from their management. You can see how they dealt with Bezos.""
""Writing this letter, to me, is disgusting. To say were going to expose things about you unless you something nice about us or stop saying un-nice things about us, thats just beyond the pale.

The man who confessed Tuesday to being behind a $25 million scheme to help college applicants cheat on entrance exams published a book in 2014 that stressed the need to establish a personal brand to get into a top school.
Now, William Rick Singers personal brand includes a host of criminal charges that could send him to jail for a maximum of 65 years.
Singer admitted that he helped bring down his own criminal enterprise by becoming a cooperating witness and wearing a wire for the FBI.
Of course, Singer is not the only one stung by his involvement in the scheme.
Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California, according to the indictment.
Now one of their daughters, YouTube celebrity and social media influencer Olivia Jade, is coming under fire for past comments she made insinuating that she was not the most eager scholar.
The scandal has exposed the lengths some wealthy parents will go to get their children into elite colleges. While most parents are horrified by the scam, the stress and desperation of the college admissions process behind it is all too familiar.
FAA stands by its call to allow Boeing jet model to fly
Aviation experts, consumer advocates and politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for the Federal Aviation Administration to get the 737 Max 8 and Max 9 out of the skies while safety concerns raised by two recent deadly crashes are addressed.
But the federal agency has doubled down on its decision to allow airline carriers to continue operating the aircraft over America.
""Thus far, our review shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft,"" the FAA said in a statement released Tuesday night.
That hasn't stopped the flood of criticism from industry experts.
""Theres been very little attention that has been paid in our country to the large loss of life in both of these accidents,"" one former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ""Had these accidents occurred in the United States, would we still be discussing this?""
With 16 days to go, the path forward on Brexit is clear as mud
For the second time in as many months, British lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa Mays divorce deal with the European Union.
Tuesday's crushing defeat came just over two weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the 28-country bloc on March 29.
It casts doubt on whether Britain's departure will occur as scheduled or even at all.

Comparing any modern-day pop act to The Beatles is a fool's game rock purists will sneer at the implication that anyone existing in the modern world could exist alongside The Fab Four, while pop diehards will claim that any attempt to frame the present in the past is a discounting of the modern day. But Ariana Grande's commanding of the top three spots on this week's Hot 100 singles chart, which ties a record set by The Beatles in 1964, does show how music consumption has changed since the days of Beatlemania, with the unison screams of the sixties now echoed in excitable fans' tweets of 2019.
Much like most of the other records-of-yore that have been broken by streaming-age upstarts, the comparison between what the Beatles and Grande isn't exact. In 1964, when The Beatles achieved their high-water mark of Hot 100 dominance at one point, they actually had all of the top five spots on the chart the U.S. labels that were able to release their work flooded the market with physical singles that listeners had to buy, in order to push their chart points higher. This was in addition to the full albums of both new and repackaged material that were being released at a fast-enough clip to capitalize on The Beatles' success.

Back then, in order to make the Hot 100, a song had to be released as a physical single, separate from a longer work. ""Album cuts,"" as they were known, weren't eligible for the big chart until late 1998. In the mid-'90s, zeitgeist-defining songs the Rembrandts' bouncy ""Friends"" theme ""I'll Be There for You,"" No Doubt's glittery power ballad ""Don't Speak"" didn't cross over to the Hot 100 despite being staples on radio and MTV because their labels hadn't released physical singles, hoping that intrigued listeners would instead buy the full albums to get the songs.
In December 1998, though, Billboard shifted the chart from a ""singles"" chart to one that just tracked the popularity of songs. This had the effect of turning albums with one or two big hit songs into $18.99 maxi-singles, bought so that listeners could ""own"" that song and it, albeit briefly, helped goose the music industry's numbers enough that the Recording Industry Association of America introduced the Diamond Award, given to albums that shipped more than 10 million copies.
Of course, in the years that followed, the introduction of the post-physical music marketplace first file-sharing, then digital downloads and finally (at least for now) streaming slowed that once seemingly endless growth. The new listening landscape also helped the chart reach its current ability to properly track music-consumption habits: Paid digital download numbers were introduced into the chart's calculus in 2005, streaming data from AOL and Yahoo! arrived two years later, ""on-demand songs"" from Spotify and other services were brought into the mix in 2012 and, in 2013, Billboard began including YouTube plays in their Hot 100 calculus.
Further tweaks to the formula have happened since then, but the introduction of YouTube is probably the one that's had the most effect on the charts and it definitely boosted Grande's standing in the week following the release of her album ""thank u, next.""
The album, which officially came out on Feb. 8, already had two popular singles out in the work before its release date: The title track, which came out in November, and the ""My Favorite Things""-interpolating consumerist ode ""7 Rings,"" which was released in January. Both those tracks make up two-thirds of Grande's current stronghold; the other is the album's final track, the 'NSync-sampling come-on, ""break up with your girlfriend, I'm bored.""
""break up"" was the beneficiary not only of its saucy conceit, but that the video for the track, a club fantasia where Grande plays femme fatale, came out on the same day as the album ""thank u, next."" This strategy of releasing songs in a music-and-video promotional blitz is both made possible by and a beneficiary of the streaming era, when releasing songs to the public and videos to the masses is as easy as uploading a file.
It was yet another savvy move by Grande, who's proven herself to be one of the artists most capable at keeping up with streaming-era demands of constant curiosity about both her music and her persona. It helps that she's a huge celebrity who's been in the public eye for more than a decade, and her relative youth compared to other female megastars (at 25, she's a year younger than Miley Cyrus) also makes her appealing to radio programmers trying to catch post-millennial ears.
""thank u, next"" is also a pretty good record one that has a bunch of potential radio hits in waiting. (""Needy,"" which was Grande's fourth-highest-charting ""thank u, next"" song on this week's chart, seems primed to be, umr, next.) Grande's chatty social-media presence, ripe-for-discussion videos and aurally appealing, diaristic pop make her an ideal superstar for the always-on atmosphere of 2019. The increasingly winner-take-all nature of pop in the streaming era, when entire albums can flood the Hot 100 with their individual songs because of rule changes and rabid fanbases, only adds fuel to her dominance.

"The Australian government is warning citizens to be on the look out for crocodiles and snakes in the streets amid severe rainfall and flooding in north Queensland over the past few days.
Crocodiles prefer calmer waters and they may move around in search of a quiet place to wait for floodwaters to recede, Leeanne Enoch, Queensland's minister for environment, said in a statement Monday.
A handout photo taken by Erin Hahn on Feb. 3, 2019 shows a crocodile during the floods in Townsville, Australia.
She continued, Crocodiles may be seen crossing roads, and when flooding recedes, crocodiles can turn up in unusual places such as farm dams or waterholes where they have not been seen before. Similarly, snakes are very good swimmers and they too may turn up unexpectedly.
The coastal city of Townsville has been the most affected by the flooding. Local media outlet 7news posted a video on Twitter of an 11-foot crocodile crawling up a highway to the north of the city. One image of a crocodile roaming the streets has been shared over 20,000 times on Facebook.
Townsville has been brought to a standstill by severe flooding after an all-time record rainfall, the premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said Saturday. The town has experienced the equivalent of 3.2 feet of rainfall over the past week.
Townsville has had the equivalent of more than one metre of rain in the last seven days.This is an all time record and were not out of the woods yet. Were also seeing impacts in the North-West of the state.If you dont have to be out on the roads, please dont be. #qldfloodpic.twitter.com/npoQCUIn8f

Heavy rain continues to drench Townsville, with 6 to 10 inches of rainfall lashing the city since Sunday morning, according to the Townsville Bulletin. Around 17,000 properties in Townsville are believed to be without power.
The Queensland Bureau of Meteorology issued a major flood warning for Townsville on Sunday night, saying that conditions will change rapidly &amp; continuously due to unprecedented areas of flooding.
Queensland police and the army have been drafted to help respond to the crisis.
Local authorities have used dam releases at the local Ross River dam to ease the impact of the rainfall, the Bureau of Meteorology said, but there remains a risk to life and property.

When Khadija Tariyan was 3, she plunged off the top of a sliding board and crash-landed, face down, onto a sand-cushioned playground.
I looked away for a second, recalled her mother, Gayle McKinney Griffith, an original dance member of the legendary Dance Theatre of Harlem, which celebrates its 50th anniversary season in April. I saw her hit the ground. She started pounding the sand, screaming.
Distressed, McKinney Griffith carried her daughter to their doctor who lived nearby. Tariyans broken collarbone soon healed, but her passion for launching herself off of tall places had just been ignited.
Tariyans daredevil athletics that involved another broken bone her thumb evolved into a decision to focus on dance that coalesced last November when she made her Broadway debut in the $35 million ""King Kong"" musical, directed and choreographed by Drew McOnie.
As a member of the predominantly male, 10-person ""King's Company,"" she and one other female dancer transform the colossal 2,000 pound, 20-foot-high King Kong hulk into an expressive, lifelike character that exhibits and elicits a wide range of emotions. They also sing and act in the ensemble when Kong is not on stage.
""I even get to show a little bit of my aerial skills,"" boasted Tariyan, who is tethered to a harness these days.
Khadija Tariyan and her mother Gayle.Giannella M. Garrett
Over a recent interview with NBCBLK in McKinney Griffiths cozy, 100-year-old home in New London, Connecticut, the mother and daughter discussed how trusting in their natural talents and artistry has guided them to rewarding artistic experiences.
For Tariyan, King Kong represents the best thing she never imagined leaping off that sliding board as a toddler. Over the course of the show, she undergoes 14 costume changes, playing a worldly lady in a golden dress, a rollicking New York show girl, and a dock worker in electrifying ensemble musical numbers.
But her most satisfying and challenging role in the show occurs when shes collaborating with the nine other puppeteers who commandeer the massive Kong marionette with rigging ropes, hand loops and buttons that trigger the Kings chest beats, knuckle walks and subtlest of movements. The group maintains constant communication, by way of hidden headsets and mics, with three operators in a soundproof booth on the theaters balcony who control the animatronic apes head and facial expressions.
In the climactic and heartbreaking Empire State Building scene, using her body weight, she launches off Kongs steel and fiberglass back, to raise his fists upward to defend himself against the fighter jet circling him.
She and a fellow puppeteer then grab a rope, requiring the utmost control and timing, to lower the doomed creatures arm to console Christiani Pitts, who stars as Ann Darrow, weeping by his side. The singed rope draws smoke as it slides through our gloves, Tariyan said. For the finale, the entire Kings Company promenades around Kong, guiding the ropes, as he rotates 360 degrees and falls to his death. Its as if a part of us dies with him.
The Company of ""KING KONG""Matthew Murphy
Born and raised in Berlin after her parents were invited to perform musical theater there and decided to stay, Tariyan draws inspiration from her mom who always immersed her in the arts.
Dija was always a part of my artistic life, McKinney Griffith said. I embraced her into my craft and took her to rehearsals, theaters and performances. She was exposed to a lot of international influences. She was interested in everything.
Early on, Tariyan, who fizzes youthful joy, exhibited a talent for extreme sports. She decided to focus her fearlessness into ballet training at 11. She taught herself sewing to design her own theatrically inspired clothes. During her teen years, she lived for dance cyphers. It was like a second education in how my body moved, listening to what the DJs played and communicating with dance partners, she said.
American and hip-hop influence were the rage in Berlin at the time. she continued. My parents, both African-American artists, were very supportive of exposing me to people of color who were engaged in the world, so I wouldnt feel alone or question my worth.
A few months after graduating from Connecticut College, with a major in dance, she landed a role in the off-Broadway production and tour of Fuerza Bruta, a heart-pounding, interactive, dance spectacle that originated in Buenos Aires and showcased her athleticism and grace. Tariyan said she feels a flood of gratitude for the valuable professional tips her mother gave her along the way, from lending her character shoes to teaching her how to dye tights to match her skin tone. Their careers paralleled in a delightful way when Tariyan got a gig with The Wiz Live! Her mom had danced in The Wiz movie three decades earlier.
In the 1970s, we were breaking open doors to prove ourselves and convince the world we were a bonafide ballet company, McKinney Griffith said. Seeing so many people of color at least a third of the cast has made me very proud. As I see it, Khadija is now in the position of breaking open doors. By standing on the shoulders of the great people that came before her, shes able to forge on.
When she isnt rehearsing or performing in the show, Tariyan is working on an EP with a group of talented musicians that developed into a show she created, titled Khadija. She recently performed it on a Kong off-night at a Greenwich Village cabaret to benefit the Trevor Project.
It kind of hit me two weeks ago; I have this great job that allows me to perform art, but it also grants me the opportunity to create my own art, she said. Im so thankful.
Her mom, eyes aglow, purrs in a low hum as her daughter speaks. Shes now teaching me, she said.

Good morning, NBC News readers.
Big techs role in spreading extremism is coming under scrutiny again in the wake of the New Zealand shooting massacre. The Midwest is bracing for more flooding after a 'catastrophic' deluge in Iowa and Nebraska.
And meet a charming 8-year-old refugee who is also New York State's reigning chess champ for his age group.
Here's what we're watching today.
Can social media companies control the spread of hate?
The dissemination of a video across the internet apparently recorded by a shooter who killed 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand has reignited debate around how tech companies moderate their platforms and whether they've done enough to crack down on the spread of hate online.
Critics say that companies like Facebook and YouTube have not done enough to address white supremacist groups on their platforms. Others counter that pushing tech companies to further regulate extremism will not fix the deeper problems of online radicalization.
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern vowed that her government will take a look at the role social media may have played in the massacre.
""They are the publisher, not just the postman,"" Arden said during a passionate speech to Parliament on Tuesday. ""There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.""
'Unbelievable' flooding in the Midwest and more to come
Vast stretches of the Midwest remained threatened by what the National Weather Service described late Monday as ""major to historic"" flooding, even as officials and residents grappled with a recent deluge that left three people dead in Iowa and Nebraska.
Flood warnings and advisories remained in effect across the Plains, the Mississippi Valley, and parts of the Ohio Valley region, the weather agency said.

His family came to New York from Nigeria two years ago fleeing persecution by Boko Haram terrorists on Christians like themselves. His dad works two jobs and his mother just passed a home health care course, but they live in a homeless shelter.
Since his big win there has been a huge outpouring of support from a New York Times article to a GoFundMe page for Tani thats raised over $100,000.
His parents have been stunned by the generosity of the city and country where they prayed to find refuge. Im so proud of him, says his mom.

She had insurance and still got smacked with a huge bill. She's not alone.
When Nicole Briggs rushed to a hospital to get an emergency appendectomy, she checked if the hospital took her insurance. They did. Phew.
But two months after the surgery, she got a whopping bill for almost $5,000 from the surgeon. Unbeknownst to her, he practiced independently and did not take her insurance.
She declined to pay the bill. Two years later, a collection agency slapped a lien on her home.
""It's really scary,"" Briggs said. ""This is all we have, and to think that it could all be taken away, because some doctor doesn't feel like taking anyone's insurance is it's just so wrong.""
She's not alone. NBC News found hundreds of examples of surprise medical bills leading to liens on homes and crippling debt.

"The flood-control spillway at the nation's tallest dam will be deployed this week for the first time since it was rebuilt after it crumbled during heavy rains two years ago, forcing nearly 200,000 people to evacuate, California officials said Sunday.
Disaster was ultimately averted during the 2017 downpours, but Oroville Dam needed repairs that totaled $1.1 billion.
The Department of Water Resources has ""restored full functionality to the Oroville main spillway and is operating the reservoir to ensure public safety of those downstream,"" the agency said in a statement.
No more than a relatively gentle 20,000 cubic feet (566 cubic meters) per second will be released down the spillway during expected rains on Tuesday, the statement said. Triple that amount could be released later in the week as more water flows into Lake Oroville.
The state has been hinting for weeks that the spillway could be reused soon as an exceptionally wet winter starts to give way to the spring snowmelt season in the Sierra, according to the Sacramento Bee . The lake level, deliberately kept low during repairs, has risen to about 50 feet (15 meters) from the top.
The dam was releasing water at around 50,000 cubic feet (1,416 cubic meters) per second in February 2017 when a giant crater erupted in the main spillway. Dam operators dialed back water releases to minimize the damage, causing lake levels to rise so high that water spilled over the adjacent emergency spillway several days later for the first time since the dam opened in 1968.
DWR and its contractor, Kiewit, spent the last two years making repairs. A panel of independent investigators blamed the crisis on ""long-term systemic failure"" dating back to the original design and construction of the two spillways.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said this month that it was refusing to reimburse California for $306 million of the $1.1 billion repair bill, citing the investigators' report and blaming the state for years of neglect. DWR officials said they plan to appeal the decision.","California officials say the flood-control spillway at the nation's tallest dam will be deployed this week for the first time since it was rebuilt after it crumbled during heavy rains two years ago, forcing nearly 200,000 people to evacuate",2019-03-31T21:52:42Z,Repaired spillway at nation's tallest dam to be deployed,ABC News,0
"Climate change was on the ballot in cities and states across the United States last week. The results disappointed people who had hoped that in some states, at least, Americans were ready to tackle global warming. Of the high-profile initiatives aimed at weaning the nation off fossil fuels, a majority failed to pass. Some observers concluded that voters still shrug about climate change, or, more starkly, the climate lost. Losses included a carbon tax initiative in Washington state, a renewable energy mandate in Arizona and new fracking restrictions in Colorado. All this suggests that its hard to persuade people to pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This isnt surprising. Even in left-leaning states, Americans rank climate change as a low priority, compared to many other public issues. Whats more, electric utilities and the oil and gas industry spent heavily to defeat the measures, which, research shows, often reduces the likelihood that such measures will pass. But another set of ballot measures related to climate change has received less attention. While voters rejected major efforts to slow the advance of climate change, they mostly supported measures to adapt to climate change impacts. [ Will climate change lead to mass migration and conflict? ] Investing in slowing climate change is different from investing in adapting to climate change. The politics of adapting to climate change are different from the politics of limiting the magnitude of climate change. State and local efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions impose costs that are concentrated and immediate, but offer benefits that are spread across the globe and may never be visible. But when a community invests in adapting to climate change, those taxpayers benefit more directly, in two ways. First, investing in adaptation can help the community endure and survive natural disasters and other climate change effects both boosting the local economy and keeping people safe. For instance, improved wastewater infrastructure along the coast reduces the nuisance and public health risk of being exposed to raw sewage in the case of flooding from storm events and sea level rise. And it also puts people to work. Second, adaptation efforts may offer value for a community whether or not the climate changes. For instance, a city might invest in green spaces to reduce flooding resulting in more parks, lower urban temperatures, and other human health benefits. As a result, advocates for these policies dont have to argue about whether humans have changed the climate, which is an ideological minefield that makes climate politics challenging. Still, for a variety of reasons, Americans have been slow to invest in the infrastructure that will protect against climate-related risks. Research shows that while many communities are starting to plan for adaptation, funding these efforts remains a challenge. [ What does it take to build climate resilience especially among the worlds most vulnerable? ] A few initiatives to adapt to climate change passed. The midterm elections changed that, if only slightly. In two New England states, voters approved bonds for clean water infrastructure. Maine and Rhode Island are targeting funds toward improving the performance of wastewater and storm-water systems when theres flooding, and Rhode Island will set aside money to improve the resiliency of vulnerable coastal habitats. In California, two local measures won the necessary two-thirds support for major investments in protective infrastructure. San Franciscans approved a $425 million bond to rebuild the Embarcadero sea wall, which will help protect the city as sea levels rise. Los Angeles County voters adopted a new parcel tax on paved surfaces, which will pay for storm water improvements to reduce pollution and capture more storm water to boost the regions fragile water supply. Supporters had abandoned a similar measure in 2013 when it met strong opposition. And in Houston, which recently had a disastrous hurricane, 75 percent of voters reapproved a fund to pay for drainage projects and street repairs. Virginia passed the most controversial adaptation measure : a constitutional amendment allowing local governments to cut taxes on flood-prone properties if homeowners make investments that reduce the homes flood risk. Its controversial because of how it handles one of the most difficult tensions in adaptation policy: the tension between encouraging relocation away from climate-related risks and maintaining local tax bases to protect those who remain. [ The climate is changing. Heres how politics will also change. ] Its a start. These votes didnt signal that Americans are fully ready to pay the costs of adapting to climate change. Many measures were not framed in climate change language at all. And voters approved public spending for other types of infrastructure as well for example, passing the majority of transportation ballot measures that appeared before them. But given the stream of news articles noting that greenhouse-gas-reduction measures failed, its worth noting a quiet signal that Americans are beginning, at least, to recognize that we need to protect ourselves from climate changes effects.

"In a year of congressional lowlights, the hearings we held with Silicon Valley leaders last fall may have been the lowest. One of my colleagues in the House asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai about the workings of an iPhone a rival Apple product. Another colleague asked Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg, If youre not listening to us on the phone, who is? One senator was flabbergasted to learn that Facebook makes money from advertising. Over hours of testimony, my fellow members of Congress struggled to grapple with technologies used daily by most Americans and with the functions of the Internet itself. Given an opportunity to expose the most powerful businesses on Earth to sunlight and scrutiny, the hearings did little to answer tough questions about the tech titans monopolies or the impact of their platforms.
Its not because lawmakers are too stupid to understand Facebook. Its because our available resources and our policy staffs, the brains of Congress, have been so depleted that we cant do our jobs properly.
Americans who bemoan a broken Congress rightly focus on ethical questions and electoral partisanship. But the tech hearings demonstrated that our greatest deficiency may be knowledge, not cooperation. Our founts of independent information have been cut off, our investigatory muscles atrophied, our committees stripped of their ability to develop policy, our small staffs overwhelmed by the army of lobbyists who roam Washington. Congress is increasingly unable to comprehend a world growing more socially, economically and technologically multifaceted and we did this to ourselves.
When the 110th Congress opened in 2007, Democrats rode into office on a tide of outrage at the George W. Bush administration and the Republican Congress, which had looked the other way during the Tom DeLay, Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham scandals. My colleagues and I focused our energies on exposing corruption. But we missed crucial opportunities to reform the institution of Congress. As my party assumes a new majority in the House, we confront similar circumstances and have a second chance to begin the hard work of nursing our chamber back to strength.
Our decay as an institution began in 1995, when conservatives, led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), carried out a full-scale war on government. Gingrich began by slashing the congressional workforce by one-third. He aimed particular ire at Congresss brain, firing 1 of every 3 staffers at the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office. He defunded the Office of Technology Assessment, a tech-focused think tank. Social scientists have called those moves Congresss self-lobotomy, and the cuts remain largely unreversed.
Gingrichs actions didnt stop with Congresss mind: He went for its arms and legs, too, as he dismantled the committee system, taking power from chairmen and shifting it to leadership. His successors as speaker have entrenched this practice. While there was a 35 percent decline in committee staffing from 1994 to 2014, funding over that period for leadership staff rose 89 percent.
This imbalance has defanged many of our committees, as bills originating in leadership offices and K Street suites are forced through without analysis or alteration. Very often, lawmakers never even see important legislation until right before we vote on it. During the debate over the Republicans 2017 tax package, hours before the floor vote, then-Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) tweeted a lobbying firms summary of GOP amendments to the bill before she and her colleagues had had a chance to read the legislation. A similar process played out during the Republicans other signature effort of the last Congress, the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Their bill would have remade one-sixth of the U.S. economy, but it was not subject to hearings and was introduced just a few hours before being voted on in the dead of night. This is what happens when legislation is no longer grown organically through hearings and debate.
Congress does not have the resources to counter the growth of corporate lobbying. Between 1980 and 2006, the number of organizations in Washington with lobbying arms more than doubled, and lobbying expenditures between 1983 and 2013 ballooned from $200 million to $3.2 billion. A stunning 2015 study found that corporations now devote more resources to lobby Congress than Congress spends to fund itself. During the 2017 fight over the tax legislation, the watchdog group Public Citizen found that there were more than 6,200 registered tax lobbyists, vs. 130 aides on the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation, a staggering ratio approaching 50-to-1 disfavoring the American people. In 2016 in the House, there were just 1,300 aides on all committees combined, a number that includes clerical and communications workers. Our expert policy staffs are dwarfed by the lobbying class.
The practical impact of this disparity is impossible to overstate as lobbyists flood our offices with information on issues and legislation information on which many lawmakers have become reliant. Just a few weeks ago, at the end of the session, I witnessed the biennial tradition of departing members of Congress relinquishing their suites to the incoming class. As lawmakers emptied their desks and cabinets, the office hallways were clogged with dumpsters overflowing with reports, white papers, massaged data and other materials, a perfect illustration of the proliferating junk dropped off by lobbyists.
Congress remade its committees in the 1970s to challenge Richard Nixons presidency and move power to rank-and-file lawmakers. Many segregationist chairmen were ousted and replaced by reformers, and committees and subcommittees were given flexibility to study issues under their purview. Its no accident that some of the most significant legislation and oversight by Congress Title IX; the Clean Water Act; the Watergate, Pike and Church hearings came from this period. Congress had strengthened its pillars, hired smart people and accessed the best information available.
Following the reforms of the 1970s, the House held some 6,000 hearings per year. But eventually, the number of House hearings fell from a tick above 4,000 in 1994 to barely more than 2,000 in 2014. On the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, of which I am a member, oversight hearings are virtually nonexistent, as is developing legislation. We had no hearings in 2017 on the bill that would dramatically rewrite our tax code. And in the last Congress, we didnt haul in any administration officials for a single public hearing on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Assessing this state of affairs in a 2017 report, the Congressional Management Foundation noted that committees have been meeting less often than at almost any other time in recent history. This neglect has become the norm. Instead, leadership, lobbyists and the White House decide how to solve policy problems.
Indeed, Congress has allowed the White House to dominate policymaking. Trade is a perfect illustration. Despite our current presidents braggadocio, most Americans would be surprised to learn ultimate trade power rests with Congress. But over and over weve willingly, even eagerly, handed off that responsibility given to us by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. President Trumps power to renegotiate NAFTA was granted by Congress, as was his power to issue tariffs, allowed under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. I disagreed with the decision in 2015 to give President Barack Obama a member of my own party fast-track power to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership. During that debate, I sat stupefied as some members of our committee sought to award not only Obama but also future, unknown executives an extended and open-ended authority to make other deals. Congress was prepared to simply abdicate our job.
Perhaps the most striking instance of political interference Ive seen in my career occurred in the Ways and Means Committee in 2014. Then-Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) had toiled for months with Democrats, Republicans and budget experts to craft a comprehensive tax reform bill. I may not have loved the final product, but I respected the process. Republican leadership killed the proposal almost immediately after it was unveiled. The reason? They wanted to deny Obama a legislative accomplishment.
For decades, nearly every piece of legislation would reach the floor via committee, but beginning in the 1990s, the rate began to drop. In the 113th Congress, approximately 40 percent of big-ticket legislation bypassed committees. Before 1994, Camp would have informed the speaker of his proposal and brought it to the floor. Now, a chairman has much less power to realize meaningful legislation. Meanwhile, longstanding House rules have essentially blocked the amendment process on the floor, meaning bills cant be modified by members of the wider chamber.
In addition to committee weakness, House lawmakers collectively employ fewer staffers today than they did in 1980. Between 1980 and 2016, when the U.S. population rose by nearly 97 million people and districts grew by 40 percent on average (about 200,000 people per seat), the number of aides in House member offices decreased, to 6,880, and total House staff increased less than 1 percent, to 9,420.
The first lobe of Congresss brain we can bulk back up is the Congressional Research Service. The CRS provides studies from talented experts spanning law, defense, trade, science, industry and other realms. Some of our greatest oversight triumphs Watergate, Iran-contra, the Freedom of Information Act were achieved with the CRSs support. Great nations build libraries, and much of the CRS is housed in the Library of Congresss Madison Building.
But the CRS has become a political target. In 2012, a CRS report finding that tax cuts do not generate revenue enraged my Republican colleagues, who had the report pulled and began browbeating CRS experts. According to figures supplied by the CRS, the next year, the service saw its funding cut by $5 million, nearly 5 percent, recovering to previous levels only in 2015. (The CRS did get big funding bumps in recent years.)
The Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office, crown jewels of our body that provide nonpartisan budget projections, are similarly ignored or maligned for partisan purposes. Last year, when the CBO debunked claims that the GOP tax plan would create jobs, Republicans savaged the agency instead of improving the law. It reminded one of my colleagues, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), of an episode of The Simpsons in which Springfield residents, rescued from a hurtling comet, resolve to raze the town observatory.
The GAO also furnishes rich information to Congress on virtually any subject. Last year I requested and obtained a study on the live-events ticket market. It was a probing report with fresh data. Former senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), one of the most conservative lawmakers of the past generation, praised the GAO, estimating that every dollar of funding for the agency potentially saved Americans $90. Nonetheless, from 1980 to 2015, GAO staffing was cut by one-fifth.
While I never had the pleasure of collaborating with the Office of Technology Assessment, its reputation is legendary. Like the GAO, it operated as a think tank for Congress, tasked with studying science and technology issues. The OTA was Congresss only agency solely conducting scholarly work on these issues until Gingrich disemboweled it. Today, few members of Congress know it ever existed.
The congressional hearings on big tech showcased my colleagues inability to wrap their heads around basic technologies. But our challenges dont stop at Silicon Valley. Biomedical research, CRISPR, space exploration, artificial intelligence, election security, self-driving cars and, most pressingly, climate change are also on Congresss plate.
And we are functioning like an abacus seeking to decipher string theory. By one estimate, the federal government spends $94 billion on information technology, while Congress spends $0 on independent assessments of technology issues. We are crying out for help to guide our thinking on these emerging areas. I have backed motions to bring the OTA back to life, and I was heartened last year when the House Appropriations Committee approved funding for a study on the feasibility of a new OTA.
The creation in the House rules of a Select Committee for the Modernization of Congress in this new session is a terrific beginning and a signal that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) understand the importance of these issues. Providing capital and staff to the institution should be a major priority in the 116th Congress. The budgets we approve fund 445 executive departments, agencies, commissions and other federal bodies. But for every $3,000 the United States spends per American on government programs, we allocate only $6 to oversee them.
After decades of disinvesting in itself, Congress has become captured by outside interests and partisans. Lawmakers should be guided by independent scholars, researchers and policy specialists. We must recognize our difficulties in comprehending an impossibly complex world. Undoing the mindless destruction of 1994 will take a lot of effort, but with investment, we can make Congress work again.",We lawmakers dumped our in-house experts.

"MINNEAPOLIS - Those who expected a flood of one-and-done talent in Minnesota for the 2019 Final Four might not be ecstatic to see Big 12 co-champion Texas Tech on the scene, a No. 3 seed in the West piloted by a coach not many knew before the Red Raiders bounced Gonzaga last weekend. 
“We might have a couple of one-and-done graduate assistants. We had a couple of issues with our breakfast this morning, so ...,” Beard said Thursday at U.S. Bank Stadium. 
While Gonzaga spent part of the season atop the Top 25 poll and Duke was the No. 1 overall seed thanks to freshman All-Americans Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett, Beard and the defense-wins mantra of Texas Tech are left standing. A similar mindset, and a roster with a familiar makeup, awaits in the national semifinals Saturday in the form of Michigan State. The Spartans ousted Duke in a thriller Sunday. 
“We’re looking forward to playing on this stage. In our opinion, Michigan State is one of the best teams in college basketball,” Beard said. “They have great players and a Hall of Fame coach. We have nothing but respect for their program, the things they stand for. We’re in our third year building the program at Tech, and we’re striving to be in the conversation with the Michigan States of the world. 
“Simply stated, we feel like we’ll have to play our best game of the year to have some success on Saturday night, but I don’t think that’s much difference than anybody else in this tournament. That’s our objective. We’re looking forward to the opportunity to play well on Saturday.” 
Texas Tech lost slashing guard Zhaire Smith, a first-round pick in 2018, after reaching the Elite Eight and losing to eventual champion Villanova. Beard knows about one-and-done talent. He also understands the value in building a team anchored in experience. 
“I’ve always seen the value in the one-and-done, too,” Beard said. “I think college basketball is better because of Zhaire Smith playing at Texas Tech. I think in this tournament, I would agree with that, there’s some identities with these four teams. I think that’s what these four teams are teams. ... The identity of each team, I think, is the balance of different players, not just one star player.” 
Beard said he watched every Michigan State game played this season. The teams have a few common opponents, most notably Michigan. Texas Tech hammered the Wolverines, holding the No. 2 seed in the West Region to 44 points in Anaheim last week. Michigan State gave up an average of 64 points to their in-state rivals this season. 
There’s also some likenesses between the teams and their coaches. 
Izzo has come under fire for his demonstrative, chest-to-chest coaching tactics. One such flare-up in Michigan State’s first-round nailbiter against Bradley became the subject of national debate. 
Beard can relate. 
He was an assistant under Bob Knight at Texas Tech (2001-11) before becoming a head coach at McMurry University in Abilene, Texas. 
Knight was of a different era, a breed all his own. Even partial observers admit there are incidents in Knight’s past in which he clearly crossed the so-called line. But Beard believes, in his words, players need to be coached. It’s up to the coach and the player to define the line between coaching and coddling. 
Beard said he learned to get there by setting expectations and not asking players to put in more than coaches are willing to give. 
“That line is really easy to find. That line is called trust,” Beard said. “We make no bones about it. We do coach our guys hard, but I’ve never coached a good player that didn’t want to be coached hard ever. I think about that all the time. I can’t name one guy that I’ve ever coached who’s an All-Conference player, a pro at any level I’ve coached that didn’t want us to bring it. 
“I don’t promise our guys a lot in the recruiting process, but one thing I promise is I look them right in the face I will bring it every single day as a coach, and our staff will too. If there’s one day where you don’t think we’re bringing it, you tell me, and the problem will be corrected. I asked this team just the other night, did we keep our word? And they said, yes, you did.” 
It’s not all fire and brimstone with the 46-year-old who went to the University of Texas and was a manager for Tom Penders. 
Upon arrival at the Final Four, he posted a sign in the locker room that says Smell The Roses. 
The message is for players to take time to breathe in the atmosphere, recognize only four teams are still standing in the 2019 NCAA Tournament and then refocus on winning two more games. 
“This is our process, and one of our processes has always been balance, enjoying life, like we never want to be the team that just doesn’t enjoy a victory,” Beard said. “So we have a 12-hour rule. We don’t ever want to be the team that doesn’t enjoy the great cities we get to go to. This year we played Duke in Madison Square Garden. We enjoyed New York City. We went and played pickup at Rucker Park. We ate ridiculously priced food. We walked around the skulls of the Garden (to) see all the great performers that played there. We’re going to enjoy life. We’re going to enjoy the ride. It’s who we are. 
“But when it’s time to play, it’s time to play, and when it’s time to practice, it’s time to practice. So we just got a two-part mission here. Smell the roses but also be us, and be us is just four letters and two words to mean let’s ride the bus that got us here.”

"The swift and steep drop in oil prices has been the talk of Wall Street for several weeks and is good news for 30 million American travelers as they head into a busy Thanksgiving holiday. But the the dramatic decline cuts both ways, with several energy firms big and small seeing their stock prices fall even as President Trump cheers the lowest oil prices in more than a year. On Wednesday morning, the president tweeted : Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but lets go lower! Hes a piece of work, said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Heartland Financial. Its all supply, that is the issue. The U.S. is producing 11.5 million barrels a day. We are largest producer in the world. Theres just more supply than demand currently. If Saudi Arabia keeps pumping and exemptions to Iran stay in place, prices are going to stay low. [ Trump presses Saudis to increase oil production in face of rising gas prices ] The current surplus is largely attributed to a miscalculation between demand and output by major producers, including Iran. A strong dollar is also weighing on oil prices because it makes oil more expensive for much of the world. Oil prices tend to fall as a result. Several companies have been shellacked by the commoditys price decline. Small- and medium-size independent oil companies that rely on fracking are seeing their profit margins erode, which is hurting stock prices. Newfield Explorations stock price is down 39 percent this year. PDC Energy shares are off about 30 percent. Oasis Petroleum is down 14 percent, and Apache Corp. has declined about 20 percent, Benchmark Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both saw big price drops Tuesday, but rallied on Wednesday despite a report that crude stockpiles had risen by nearly 5 million barrels last week. West Texas Intermediate was up more than 3 percent at $55.29 at 1 p.m. Benchmark Brent was up 2.2 percent at $63.94. Both are down more than 20 percent from their highs in early October. The magic number is $50 per barrel. Much below that and companies start really hurting. Oil entrepreneur Harold Hamm of Continental Resources has been one industry executive President Trump has relied on for advice. In an interview in January, Hamm said that Im not thinking at all that well see extreme prices in the future around $80 or $90 a barrel. Thats not in the interest of producers around the world. Were not trying to do that, and OPECs not thinking that either. When you read their rationale, its based on a healthy market. Hamm said that break-even costs for U.S. shale oil producers were as low as $35 a barrel and some as high as $45 or $50. But initially when OPEC started to flood the market, they thought high-cost production meant $70 in a lot of these [geological] plays, he said. What they quickly found out was that that was really wrong. That number kept falling. They realized these guys could complete with us. Thats when they had to reverse their tactics. Frank Verrastro, an oil expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he anticipates more oil price volatility until the Dec. 6 OPEC meeting, where he believes the cartel will cut production as it searches for a price close to $80 a barrel. In the meantime, he said, money managers are waiting for an event that will catalyze a change in price, whether it is a supply disruption, a geopolitical event or news that demand is stronger than thought. Verrastro said the president has his mind on one thing: keeping oil prices low, which is a huge boost to consumers. The president is thinking, Happy Thanksgiving. I give you lower prices, Verrastro said. The U.S. giants, Chevron and Exxon, saw their shares climb Wednesday, but both are down around 10 percent for 2018. Oil is a boom-and-bust business. The price drops when supply exceeds demand. Producers pull back and slow production as a result of the price squeeze. When demand exceeds supply, producers start drilling again and the cycle picks up again. [ The good and bad of the steep drop in oil prices ] The United States is the worlds biggest oil consumer at about 21 million barrels a day of the 100 million barrels produced daily worldwide. It is also a top oil producer, thanks to the shale oil renaissance over the past half-decade. Oil and gas represent about 7.6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Low prices have a salutary effect across the economy, including moderating the rate of inflation. By helping to keep inflation low, low oil prices can stem the rise of interest rates, including for mortgages and auto purchases. Oil prices dove quickly Tuesday on Trumps endorsement of strong ties to oil swing producer Saudi Arabia, the defacto OPEC leader currently under fire for the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post, in October. Saudi Arabias willingness to maintain production is crucial to keeping oil prices low and keeping the president happy. The oil giant was contemplating a cut in production at the December OPEC and non-OPEC meeting, which could raise prices. Trump has repeatedly tried to insert himself into key economic decisions made by others, particularly incensed about interest rates and oil prices. He believes low interest rates and low oil prices will help boost the economy, though he often dismisses concerns that White House interference in these decisions could distort markets. For months, Trump has tried to pressure the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to lower oil prices, even jawboning the coalition on Twitter. Looks like OPEC is at it again, he wrote. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted! Trump has imposed severe economic sanctions against Iran, which limit the ability of other countries to buy Irans oil. The move was expected to drive up oil prices, which would make it more costly for consumers and businesses, but oil prices have stayed low in recent months. In a move that limited the impact of the Iran sanctions on oil prices, however, the White House gave temporary waivers to eight countries that allowed them to keep buying Iranian petroleum, at least for a little while. This week, Trump began publicly praising Saudi Arabia for helping keep the oil prices low. His comments came as part of a strident defense he has made regarding his relationship with Saudi Arabia, dismissing assessments from U.S. intelligence agencies that top Saudi leaders were involved in the killing of Khashoggi. Last year, Trump frequently praised the economys performance, particularly focused on the run-up of the stock market. The markets performance in recent weeks has been poor, however, and Trump has tried to find other things to highlight. Energy has been one of the hardest hit sectors in the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index, thanks largely to the decline in oil. The sector slipped 3.29 percent Tuesday, the steepest of all 11 sectors.

This week he experienced something he says was a first in his career: a storm of commentators, many anonymous, swarming his social media accounts and email inbox to tell him that something he saw with his own eyes and reported in The Post did not actually happen: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, alive and well, attending a performance about her life at a museum in Washington her first public appearance since she underwent cancer surgery in December.
A falsehood has been spreading in dark corners of the Internet that Ginsburg is dead and in the hours after Barnes published his report, conspiracy theorists pelted him with their doubt-mongering. Photos were not allowed at the event, so one of the doubters emailed Barnes 21 questions about Ginsburgs appearance the size of her security detail, what gender they were, for example telling Barnes that if he did not answer every single one of them, it would be a sign his article was not to be believed.
Ginsburg did not attend the State of the Union on Tuesday night. Neither did Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor or Stephen G. Breyer, but the conspiracy theory that Ginsburg is dead may draw more oxygen from the 85-year-old justices absence.
Conspiracy theories about political figures are not new, but social media and other digital tools that allow for and, at times, encourage their wide dissemination have given them new prominence in the Trump era. Though it is impossible to know how large these groups are, the disruption they cause far exceeds their size, in part because of the visibility that social media algorithms lends to assertions that fire people up, regardless of the veracity of those claims.
But there is often more to these movements than is first apparent.
[The worlds oldest person record stood for decades. Then came a Russian conspiracy theory.]
QAnon, the shorthand for a tale that fantasizes about a vast deep-state conspiracy aimed at thwarting President Trump, was presented as an organic movement when it burst into mainstream consciousness over the summer. But reporting later showed that some of the main groups that had spread it were profiting from the attention it helped bring to them.
The Pizzagate conspiracy theory spread through the fringes of right-wing Internet culture to Twitter, where it was amplified by people with huge followings and also, as it turns out, Russian bots. And the conversation after major news events, such as the Parkland shooting in Florida last year, is routinely distorted by complex processes that lend themselves to gaming and manipulation, experts say, though specific actors and motivations can be hard to discern immediately. They include spurious accounts, trending hashtags supported by bot networks, and opaque algorithms that highlight buzzy content and commentary no matter what the facts are.
Two anonymous Twitter accounts were behind the edited snippet of video about an encounter between a group of Catholic high school boys and a Native American activist that went viral, for example. One of the accounts was later booted from Twitter after the service said it was manipulating the conversation.
In Ginsburgs case, questions about her health began to spread around the time she missed the courts first case, Jan. 7, as she was recovering from surgery she had on Dec. 21. It appears to have originated on the message boards that house the QAnon theory. An anonymous but influential account posted a stew of doubt-mongering, wondering about Ginsburgs real medical diagnosis and wondering what kind of off-market drugs were sustaining her.
The clock is ticking, the commenter wrote. PANIC IN DC.
There was no panic in D.C.
The mini empire of amplifiers, profiteers and fame seekers benefiting from QAnons small but passionate audience went to work. Soon, videos questioning the official line on Ginsburgs health were the top search results for the justices name on YouTube. An online petition to impeach her failed to meet a 5,000 signature goal.
But its real boost came when a couple of right-wing personalities with large social media followings engaged it. Ben Garrison, a prominent pro-Trump cartoonist, tweeted about Ginsburgs whereabouts, musing on his blog about whether liberals would ever keep her death a secret, so Trump couldnt fill the seat with a conservative.
The Fox News show Fox &amp; Friends briefly aired a graphic indicating that Ginsburg had died, then quickly apologized. James Woods, an actor who is a mainstay of the conspiracy-laden parts of the pro-Trump Internet, helped get the hashtag #WheresRuth trending on Twitter on Jan. 28. Two days later, Sebastian Gorka a former adviser of President Trumps tweeted Still no sign to his 700,000 followers, noting the State of the Union was about a week away.
And then the theory started to draw mainstream coverage another way that conspiracy theories spread, even when they are properly fact-checked, debunked and contextualized, experts say. And the Twitter hoaxes continued. An anonymous account shared an old photo of the presidential hearse carrying Ronald Reagans body past the U.S. Capitol, writing Prominent DC Funeral Home vehicle seen leaving the Ginsberg estate . . . whats going on?
[How a star chefs angry MAGA-hat tweet triggered a storm of misleading news]
The conspiracy theory lives on in the algorithms. 
YouTube is still recommending RGB dead as one of its autofill searches. Twitters autofill recommendations for RBG have an even wider selection: #RBGWhereYouBe, #RGBProofOfLife and RBG dead.
If hoaxers were seeking attention for the theory, they certainly have succeeded. Targeting reporters such as Barnes who have wide followings online is a good way to start. Other reporters who saw Ginsburg on Monday night at the performance were hit with the same flood of replies and emails.
After the Parkland shooting, Whitney Phillips, a Mercer University professor who studies online culture, told The Post that conspiracy theorists and hoax spreaders are really good at seeding a story with an establishment outlet so they can bring that prize back to those far-right circles. 
People know that journalists are on Twitter, searching for news and story ideas. It is considered a victory when those fringe conspiracies are amplified into the mainstream by a reporter who is trying to debunk them. After the QAnon theory went viral, for instance, conspiracy theorists were delighted by the mainstream attention.
The Supreme Court has been the target of conspiracy theories before. After Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly at a Texas ranch in 2016, conspiracy theories swirled about the nature of his death, and whether he was murdered as a political hit. The theories, which have no grounding in evidence, live on today.
The Supreme Court doesnt have another public session until Feb. 19, Barnes said, noting that specialists said theres a six- to eight-week recovery typically expected for the procedure Ginsburg had undergone.
It seems logical that she would be back for it, he said.
Barnes said he is less offended by the suggestion that he was fooled by a body double than that he made up Ginsburgs appearance Tuesday night.
Feeling grateful for tweeters who say I, and many others, saw RBG body-double, as opposed to those who think I lied, he wrote on Twitter. They wont be happy if she skips speech tonight, as she has Trumps first 2. Thomas and Alito not likely either, but, I swear, also alive.

"In a flood of new releases, ""Aquaman"" easily swam past ""Mary Poppins Returns"" and ""Bumblebee"" to lead the busy pre-Christmas weekend with an estimated $67.4 million over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.
Without a ""Star Wars"" film on the December schedule for the first time in four years, a crowded slate of films sought to capitalize on the lucrative holiday period in theaters.
The DC Comics superhero film ""Aquaman,"" which cost Warner Bros. $200 million to make, arrived already a juggernaut overseas, where it has grossed more than $400 million in three weeks of release. Including advance previews, the Jason Momoa-led ""Aquaman"" reeled in $72.1 million in U.S. and Canada theaters, bringing its global total to $482.8 million.
""Aquaman,"" directed by James Wan, has proven to be a stabilizing ""Justice League"" spinoff for Warner Bros. following bumpier DC releases outside of ""Wonder Woman."" The film garnered an A-minus Cinemascore from audiences.
For the studios, the weekend was as much about setting themselves up for Christmas to New Year's, when theaters are routinely packed through the week. With Christmas falling on a Tuesday, studio executives said the weekend was an unpredictable and distraction-filled one, competing with some of the busiest shopping days of the year.
""We really kick off starting Tuesday,"" said Warner Bros. distribution chief Jeff Goldstein, who said the ""Aquaman"" performance came in just above the studio's $65 million forecast. ""With kids not really returning to school until January 7, this aligns the stars for us in a really positive way.""
Returns were more modest for Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" sequel and Paramount's ""Transformers"" spinoff, though each had reason to expect strong business through the holidays.
""Mary Poppins Returns,"" starring Emily Blunt and directed by Rob Marshall, debuted with $22.2 million over the weekend and $31 million since opening Wednesday. That was on the low side of expectations for the musical, which cost $130 million to make.
""May Poppins Returns,"" which co-stars Lin-Manuel Miranda, will depend heavily on legs through the holiday season. On its side are good if not spectacular reviews (77 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), an A-minus CinemaScore from moviegoers and four Golden Globe nominations.
""It's a great weekend to start yourself off on a launch pad into the holiday period,"" said Cathleen Taff, head of distribution for Disney. ""We're looking forward to great word of mouth building over the next few weeks. And we're looking forward to a long run.""
""Poppins"" still narrowly edged ""Bumblebee,"" which opened with $21 million. That, too, is a soft beginning for a film that cost about $135 million to make after tax credits. It's also far off the pace of the ""Transformers"" films, the last of which (""Transformers: The Last Knight"") debuted with $44.7 million in summer 2017.
But ""Bumblebee,"" a ""Transformers"" prequel directed by Travis Knight and starring Hailee Steinfeld, has something the Michael Bay films never had: good reviews. ""Bumblebee"" was the weekend's most acclaimed new wide release with a 94 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences also gave it an A-minus CinemaScore.
""The pre-Christmas preoccupation for moviegoers affected everyone. All movies were impacted slightly by that,"" said Kyle Davies, head of distribution for Paramount. ""It doesn't concern me. We played really well with great reactions. The game plan has always been that we're now starting that play period where people go multiple times over the next few weeks, and that's the whole point.""
""To me, this weekend was a dress rehearsal for the big push that starts Christmas Day,"" added Davies.
Also in the mix is Sony's well-reviewed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" which slid to fourth in its second week with $16.7 million in ticket sales. The film also made one of the best debuts for an animated release in China where it was no. 1, grossing $26.1 million over the weekend.
Clint Eastwood's ""The Mule"" added $9.3 million in its sophomore frame, bringing its two-week total to $35 million. Bradley Cooper, who co-stars in ""The Mule,"" could also celebrate his ""A Star Is Born"" crossing $200 million domestically.
Largely overlooked in the onslaught at theaters was STXfilms' ""Second Act,"" starring Jennifer Lopez. The romantic comedy debuted with an estimated $6.5 million in 2,607 locations, drawing an audience that was 70 percent female.
But the weekend's real flop was ""Welcome to Marwen,"" the Robert Zemeckis-directed fantastical drama starring Steve Carell as an imaginative man whose scale model town helps him rehabilitate after a trauma. The film, which cost at least $40 million to make, earned just $2.3 million in 1,900 theaters. It's the second straight flop for Universal (which teamed with DreamWorks for ""Marwen"") following ""Mortal Engines."" That $100 million film debuted last weekend with $7.5 million film in ticket sales.
Yet the weekend managed to nearly equal the box office of the same weekend last year when ""The Last Jedi"" was in its second week of release and ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" opened. Ticket sales for the ""Star Wars""-less weekend were down a mere 2.1 percent, according to Comscore.
Year to date, the domestic box office is up 7.5 percent and was expected to just eke past 2016's record $11.38 billion sometime late Sunday or early Monday, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.
""The collective and cumulative strength of these newcomers, particularly 'Aquaman,' and a huge slate of holdovers gave us a stronger weekend than anyone imagined,"" Dergarabedian said. ""A superhero movie in December can make up for not having a 'Star Wars' movie in December.""
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at international theaters (excluding the U.S. and Canada), according to Comscore:
1. ""Aquaman,"" $67.4 million ($91.3 million international).
2. ""Mary Poppins Returns,"" $22.2 million.
3. ""Bumblebee,"" $21 million ($31.1 million international).
4. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" $16.7 million ($38 million international).
5. ""The Mule,"" $9.3 million.
6. ""The Grinch,"" $8.2 million ($23.7 million international).
7. ""Second Act,"" $6.5 million.
8. ""Ralph Breaks the Internet,"" $4.6 million ($9.3 million international).
9. ""Welcome to Marwen,"" $2.4 million.
10. ""Mary Queen of Scots,"" $2.2 million.

"Smarter Temperatures
Q: My wife and I always fight about the temperature in the house. I like it at 65-degrees. She wants 74-degrees. Will a smart thermostat save our marriage?
A: Finding a temperature that suits everybody is about as challenging as picking a single pizza topping for a whole party. Depending on size and circulation, two people could have a different idea of what it means to be ""cold"" and ""hot"" in a given room. A smart thermostat could be a game-changer because it's designed to be responsive to your behaviors. Granted, no thermostat will ever give a single room two different temperatures, but it's feasible to modulate the temperature in different rooms at different times, accommodating both your needs and that's just one of its tricks. Tap or click here for five reasons to get smart about your thermostat.
Be Nice to Alexa
Q: I want my kids to say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" to Alexa. We had friends over, and they say that kids should not be polite to a smart speaker. What do you think?
A: If a smart device has a human-like voice and personality, shouldn’t we treat it with the same respect we’d give to a flesh-and-blood person? Children need to practice to master etiquette skills, and Alexa gives them the chance to flex those social muscles. Then again, “Alexa” is just a computer-generated service, a faceless algorithm that communicates through a speaker. Should we also use this kind of decorum with our toaster ovens and refrigerators? The more “smart” devices we put in our homes, the more we’ll have to think about how we treat them. Tap or click here for my take on kids, Alexa, and good manners.
Best Tax Prep Sites
Q: There are so many different sites to do your taxes. Is one better than another or are they all pretty much the same?
A: Nothing can replace a skilled accountant, and if you run a business or have a messy mound of 1099s, your best bet is to consult a human provider. But if your taxes are pretty straightforward, the sheer number of online tax services may paralyze you. Which is the smoothest interface? Which is the most cost-effective? Are certain online services better suited to certain professions than others? The bottom line: It's true that not all tax software is created equal, and some sites rise above the rest. Tap or click here for the best online tax software sites to use.
Silence Facebook Rants
Q: My uncle is a total blowhard. I cannot stand him in person, and now, he's all over my Facebook feed with Trump or Pelosi this and that. How do I make it stop?
A: Millions of Americans are sick and tired of all the soap boxes and grandstanding, and they want to retreat into the playground of social media without the constant flood of angry posts. People like your uncle often behave unnaturally on social media, where they can bluster all they want without having to look anyone in the eye. Luckily, there's a simple way to shut them up. Tap or click here to silence the political rants on your Facebook feed.
Antenna Adjustment
Q: I bought an indoor antenna, and it only picks up Sesame Street. Did I waste $100 on a piece of junk?
A: Even the most dedicated four-year-old can only endure so much Elmo, so I feel your pain. Antennas can be a significant investment, and if you want free television broadcast directly to your TV, just the way households have done it since the 1950s. But your geography also plays a part; if you live in a valley surrounded by tall mountains, you may struggle to find good reception. If you live in a remote wilderness, you may only receive a channel or two, depending on the nearness of local radio towers. Still, antennas are more powerful than ever, especially now that broadcast television has gone digital, and you may just be able to salvage your new gear.

"A top Senate Democrat on the Judiciary Committee conceded in a conference call with reporters Saturday that when the special counsel's principal findings are released by Attorney General William Barr, there may well be cause for celebration among President Trump's supporters -- many of whom have stood by the president for more than two years amid a torrent of unproven allegations that the Trump campaign illegally conspired with Russia in the 2016 election.
""It's the end of the beginning but it's not the beginning of the end,"" Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons said, echoing his party's strategy of moving forward on to other investigations, including probes into Trump's financial dealings. ""Once we get the principal conclusions of the report,"" he added later, ""I think it's entirely possible that that will be a good day for the president and his core supporters.""
The timing of that potentially good day now seems to be shifting toward Sunday, after sources said a Saturday disclosure of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's primary conclusions in his now-concluded Russia investigation wasn't expected. A personal lawyer for President Trump told Fox News that Barr's report on Mueller's findings was now expected about noon Sunday, though it had earlier been expected on Saturday and the timing remains fluid.
Mueller is not recommending any further indictments as part of his inquiry, which effectively ended Friday, according to a senior Justice Department official.
Fox News is told that Barr may run the conclusions past White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Emmett Flood, who were in Mar-a-Lago along with Trump, before they are released. It will likely take longer for the facts supporting the conclusions to come out, Fox News is told, because there may be materials that are either classified, or subject to executive privilege in the factual material.

House Democrats planned meetings by phone on Saturday to share what they know about the probe and to discuss how to move forward. Some prominent Democrats are floating the idea of issuing a subpoena to Mueller himself if his report is not made public.

Fox News is told that although impeachment was not mentioned on the Democrats' conference call, a primary purpose of the discussion among top Democrat committee members was to signal that just because the Mueller probe is over, that doesn’t mean that the House’s work is over.
Democrats also discussed Congress' oversight role given that a sitting president, under DOJ guidelines, cannot be indicted.
Both parties have pushed the Justice Department to allow lawmakers to publicly discuss the report's conclusions, once lawmakers have received them from Barr.
The conclusion of Mueller's probe comes as House Democrats have launched several of their own into Trump and his personal and political dealings.

JEROME CORSI CELEBRATES END OF RUSSIA PROBE, SAYS HE'S VINDICATED IN DECISION TO RESIST MUELLER BULLYING
""It's the end of the beginning but it's not the beginning of the end.""
 Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons
Democrats have said they have to see the full report from Mueller, including underlying evidence, before they can assess it. Those demands for information are setting up a potential tussle between Congress and the Trump administration that federal judges might eventually have to referee.
Six Democratic committee chairmen wrote in a letter to Barr on Friday that if Mueller has any reason to believe that Trump ""has engaged in criminal or other serious misconduct,"" then the Justice Department should not conceal it.
""The president is not above the law and the need for public faith in our democratic institutions and the rule of law must be the priority,"" the chairmen wrote.

It's unclear what Mueller has found related to the president, if anything. In his investigation of whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the 2016 election, Mueller has brought charges against 34 people, including six aides and advisers to the president, and three companies.
But Mueller did not charge any Americans with illegally conspiring with Russians on any matter, including election interference -- a foundational reason for the launch of his high-profile probe nearly two years ago.

But anything less than the full report won't be enough for Democrats -- who on Saturday warned that they may soon set their sights on Mueller.

In a show of confidence, for his part, President Trump waved and flashed two thumbs up to supporters as he returned to his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday. The entertainer Kid Rock later uploaded a photograph of his golf outing with Trump earlier in the day.

"Flash flood watches stretch more than 500 miles, from central Mississippi to West Virginia, as early spring soakers target the Ohio and lower Tennessee valleys. A continuing parade of storminess is expected in the days ahead, and perhaps beyond.
The flooding is already underway, thanks to wet conditions over recent days. Some spots have been wet through much of the winter. As an example, a flash flood warning was issued for Davidson County in Tennessee this morning, including the Nashville metro. This round of heavy rain is expected to wane in the afternoon hours.
Weve already seen one to three inches across middle Tennessee, said Faith Borden, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Nashville. Were expecting another one to two inches this afternoon and evening. Then well dry out before we get another two or three inches this weekend. 
Its been a wet month for Music City. Nashville set a rainfall record on Feb. 6 after picking up four inches in 24 hours. And in the past three days, 2¼ inches have fallen. Were at our seventh-wettest February on record for rainfall, Borden said. Im pretty sure we could definitely move up to at least third or fourth. 
Another drenched location is Louisville. Louisville sits at 5.1 inches for the month, which is more than two inches above where it should be at this point. The Kentucky city is bracing for roughly five additional inches Saturday and Sunday. The National Weather Service in Louisville is warning that copious rainfall will agitate ongoing flooding and create new flooding. 
The seemingly endless rains are thanks to a stalled front draped along the Interstate 40 corridor, which more or less cuts Tennessee in half from north to south. Areas of heavy rain shift toward the Appalachians today into tonight, making a run in places such as Atlanta and Birmingham with sporadic downpours before falling apart.
Over the next few days, another approaching buckle in the jet stream should eventually reawaken the front, with surges of moisture riding along it like rail cars on a train track. Pine Bluff, Ark., to Memphis, Nashville and Jackson, Tenn., look to be ground zero for the halted fronts deluge. Surrounding areas such as Bowling Green, Ky., also are likely to get soaked.
Its not out of the question that one-week rain totals approach 10 inches in a few spots.
In its Wednesday morning discussion, the Weather Prediction Center referenced anomalously high ground water content as a possible factor exacerbating flood concerns.
The risk areas reflect the higher ground moisture content and reduced flash flood guidance values in the central to southern Appalachians and adjacent valley areas of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, it wrote. In other words, the ground is already saturated and it cant handle much more water. That will lower the threshold of rainfall needed to create flash flood conditions.
A large swath of the South and surrounding regions are above the 90th percentile for February ground water content. Most of the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England are in the 99th percentile!
Despite being far wetter than average, this surprisingly marks a decline in ground water for Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana since this time last month. Much of that water is left over from heavy rains earlier this winter. Meridian, Miss., recorded twice its average monthly rainfall in December 10.26 inches!
In addition to flooding rain, the weekend system will present a risk of severe thunderstorms.
The Storm Prediction Center has outlined a broad area of concern, eyeing the Ozark Plateau and lower Mississippi Valley as spots for a vigorous squall line to develop. Isolated storms ahead of the line could present a tornado threat, while a few short-lived spin-ups also are possibly embedded within the line itself. Damaging winds to 60 mph also may accompany the line as it blasts through Saturday afternoon and night, fortunately bringing an end to that round of torrential rains.
After that, there are signs that the pattern may continue to deliver some more wet weather. A cold shot from the north may ease the concern later in the month, at least for a while. Starting off so wet and heading into a wet time of year, it seems likely that well revisit this in the future.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a small pond of dissidents trying to stop fellow Democrat Nancy Pelosi from becoming Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, only one has been bold enough to publicly acknowledge the possibility of stepping in to fight a battle that could stretch for seven weeks. Democratic Representative Marcia Fudge, without formally announcing a candidacy for speaker, has tantalized Washington with hints over the past few days of her interest. As lawmakers on Friday were leaving for a week-long Thanksgiving recess, Fudge visited with Pelosi for 45 minutes in her offices. In a Twitter posting, Pelosi tersely said, “We had a candid and respectful conversation.” NBC News, also on Twitter, quoted Fudge saying after the meeting, “I am going to continue to fight.” At stake is who Democrats, fresh off a major victory in the Nov. 6 congressional elections, will choose to lead them as House speaker, arguably the second most powerful position in the U.S. government after President Donald Trump’s. Fudge, 66, despite being in the House for a decade, does not have the national profile that Pelosi has basked in during 16 years of leading her party in the chamber. And that is exactly what a group of possibly two dozen Pelosi critics are looking for - someone who has not dominated the party leadership limelight but who could fulfill several goals: New blood in a leadership team with an average age of 78; a woman in what is being called the “year of the woman” with a flood of new female lawmakers joining Democratic ranks; a lawmaker from the Midwestern “swing state” of Ohio; and someone who would make history as the first African-American speaker. Even so, plenty of Democrats are still betting on Pelosi, one of Congress’ most savvy politicians who made history herself in 2007 when she became the first female speaker, to pull out a win, both in a Nov. 28 Democratic caucus vote and a vote by the full House in early January. “One of the real problems (Pelosi) opponents are having has been that they are unable to provide a solid justification for launching this maneuver at this point in time,” said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. After all, Pelosi has just helped orchestrate a massive electoral win in the elections. Democrats made a net gain of at least 32 seats, when 23 were needed to recapture a House majority. The Republicans kept control of the U.S. Senate.

"While a historically snowy winter begins to wind down across parts of the Plains and Midwest, what threatens to be an equally historic spring flood season is now underway. From Nebraska to Wisconsin, as well as up and down rivers in the Plains and Midwest, over 10 million people are under flood warnings into the weekend in the wake of this weeks bomb cyclone.
Some of the most significant flooding thus far has hit eastern Nebraska. Widespread and extremely dangerous flooding will continue today and tonight, the National Weather Service office in Omaha wrote in an update Friday morning.
Since issuing that statement, the Weather Service itself has had to evacuate because of a dike failure on the Platte River.
In northeast Nebraska, the city of Norfolk remains under a large-scale evacuation on its east side.
Flooding there is caused by rivers like the Elkhorn rising to near-record levels and breaching levees in some spots. Weather.com reported that one-third of the city of 24,000 was evacuated. Water in that location is now subsiding, but only after a portion of the city was submerged.
Columbus, Neb., which sits at the meeting point of the Platte and Loup rivers in southeastern parts of the state has also been particularly hard hit. A farmer was killed there when his tractor was swept away while attempting to help rescue others from floodwaters. Several others are missing in the region.
Major ice jams on both rivers near Columbus led to a flash flood emergency in the area on Thursday. Officials were planning to place coal ash on the ice to help it melt and allow the rivers to recede once the natural and temporary dams were removed, but the jams broke up on their own before that plan was set into motion.
In recent days, as the bomb cyclone dispensed heavy rainfall, flooding focused on creeks and streams and small to intermediate-size rivers. Through the weekend, the most significant flooding is forecast to shift to the larger rivers in the region.
In the section of the Missouri River meandering through southeastern Nebraska to Iowa border, the Cooper Nuclear Station declared a notification of unusual event early Friday morning, signaling that the river had surpassed a height that causes concern.

According to a news release, the level of Missouri River at the location of the nuclear power plant had climbed to 42.5 feet, or 899.05 feet above sea level. The plant itself sits at 903 feet above sea level. The alert triggered initial precautions, and if the river reaches 45 feet the plant will be taken offline.
Forecasts from the Weather Service indicate that the water level at the plant may rise to about 45.5 feet this weekend, which would require a shutdown. In that event, electricity would be delivered from other sources. The last major threat to the plant occurred during historic summer flooding in 2011, but it was able to operate throughout.
Flooding on this portion of the Missouri River has already neared and surpassed record levels. While additional rises are not expected to be massive, the river may not crest until Saturday or Sunday in this area.
Major to historic river flooding will continue into the weekend for many points throughout the Missouri and Mississippi River basins. Anyone with interests along impacted rivers should monitor closely/take action.https://t.co/0mAgMs2v3P for the latest forecast river levels. pic.twitter.com/wBZmwiEkJh
— NWS (@NWS) March 15, 2019
Water levels on many of the major rivers are expected to stay near record values into early next week before slowly subsiding thereafter.
Flooding is also common across Iowa, with numerous roads across the state closed because of high water. In central portions of the state, some homes have been evacuated near Otho, where some ice jams have also been reported.
Flooding is also common if somewhat less widespread in parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and South Dakota in particular.
The towns of Lodi and Darlington in Wisconsin have seen particularly impressive flooding. In Lodi, the mayor has said its the worst hes seen in his 71 years in the city. Darlington is in the midst of its third flood in a year, which is expected to be the worst since 1993 in that location.
The flooding has been caused by a combination of factors.
Heavy rain associated with the bomb cyclone that moved through in recent days was a big catalyst. It was exacerbated by a now-melting hefty winter snow pack thanks to record winter precipitation. Ice jam blockades on rivers and still-frozen ground, which maximizes runoff, are only making matters worse.
Given the abundant precipitation through winter, and an active spring storm track through the nations midsection, the events of this week probably mark just the beginning of a long flood season.",Streams and rivers have risen to record levels in spots.,2019-03-15T18:44:34Z,"Many places are under water from Nebraska to Wisconsin, as major flooding engulfs the region",The Washington Post,1
"Jennifer Le Zotte is an assistant professor of history and material culture at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. She is the author of ""From Goodwill to Grunge: A History of Secondhand Styles and Alternative Economies."" The views expressed here are the author's. View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)Marie Kondo's Netflix show has launched a torrent of conversation, ranging from indignant and misquoting memes (Only 30 books?!) to tweets about the hilarious Netflix glitch that paired Kondo's show title with an AK-47-wielding gunman in the desert. 
What fewer people have been wondering about (I'm guessing) is how watching the show is like cashing in World War II war bonds. 
As a scholar of material culture, I can answer that question: they both prompted a rise in thrift store donations. In the 1950s, bequests to Goodwill Industries thrift stores tripled, and flea markets flourished as Americans dumped the old to make way for new. Now, in the wake of ""Tidying Up with Marie Kondo"" taking off, secondhand shops and flea markets are again reporting an upswing in incoming goods.
Reasons for trends in secondhand markets are pretty hard to pin down, but anecdotes suggest this recent flood is inspired by the wildly popular Netflix series. The show follows Kondo's 2014 #1 best-selling book ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,"" which promises permanent change in our relationship to things. Her KonMari Method instructs followers to identify and keep only objects that ""spark joy,"" and so cultivate an enduring, organic minimalism that makes tidying a pleasure rather than a chore. Tidying just once, by following the method to the uncompromising point of perfection, assures the impossibility of regressing. In her book, Kondo guarantees over and over again (at least nineteen times) that KonMari followers will NEVER REBOUND, never succumb to clutter. So maybe the gomi (or trash) expelled through the KonMari method of tidying up represents a fundamentally different sort of emetic than did the post-WWII sloughing of stuff.
In her book, Kondo entreats readers to adopt a personal rather than industrial relationship with their home as well its contents, a relationship that might lead to an attraction for more modestly sized homes, as well as pared-down possessions. But -- and this is so important -- the show bears only a superficial resemblance to the book. The 35-minute episodes necessarily elide a number of important steps in Kondo's tidying process and entirely omit much of the meaning. To appeal to a broader audience and in keeping with the brand of reality show it is, ""Tidying Up"" focuses on the individual stories of the people whose homes Kondo helps declutter, rather than the decluttering itself.
Kondo's book is calming and compelling, sensational in its practicality and passion. It emphasizes the importance of the actual space in a way that may work to disrupt our escalating consumption. Kondo, who was an in-demand professional organizer in Japan before the Netflix gig, writes that ""excess is caused by our ignorance of how much we actually own."" One reason Americans have a hard time gauging the extent of their belongings is the monumental size of our average living spaces. The average size of American homes in 2018 was 2,641 square feet, about double that of Japanese homes, a factor only lightly addressed in the Netflix series.
Today's renewed and Netflix-inspired Kondo-ism craze may seem like a mass philosophical embrace of a reformed relationship between Americans and their things, but I highly doubt this phenomenon and its accompanying rise in thrift store donations will prove to be evidence of a new, less acquisitive relationship with consumer goods. If history is an indication, they won't.
Historically, the more Americans resell or donate old possessions, the more they also buy new ones -- and vice versa. During the Great Depression and the rationing requests of WWII (when the federal government urged to ""Use it Up -- Wear it Out -- Make it Do!""), thrift stores struggled to hold the consumer ground they'd gained in the credit-happy 1920s, when more and more Americans learned to dispose of still-viable stuff.
After WWII ended, Americans dashed to make up for lost shopping time, starting with new houses and cars.
Back in 1950, when Americans purged their prewar relics and binged on new synthetic blends, the average house size was actually slightly smaller than in 1940 -- but that would soon change. Also, those houses tended to contain fewer people as multi-generation habitation declined. With the advent of the 'nuclear family' came a trend of bigger and bigger houses containing fewer and fewer people. There was more room per person, from then on out. From 1950 to 2014, new builds continued to add square footage even as the average family size kept shrinking. And that extra space filled with (to use Kondo's categories) clothing, books, papers, and miscellany.
By 1960, the coupon-clipping, Tupperware-selling housewives in the 11 million or so new suburban homes had even invented a whole new venue for secondhand sales -- garage sales. In this case (as was also true at the turn of the 19th century when American thrift stores got their start) the purchase of new things outpaced the removal of old. Americans were shedding material reminders of years of deprivation in order to eagerly take advantage of new styles and technologies. 
In the 1960s, consumers were also responding to increasingly sophisticated marketing strategies. Homes filled with easy-to-clean fabrics and time-saving electronic devices whose successors promised even more convenience and fashionability helped to lock in repeating cycles of consumer binge and purge.
In fact, despite reports celebrating the recent boost to thrift stores through ""the Kondo effect,"" the American secondhand market did not then and does not now need a boost. Each year for many decades now, major thrift stores like Goodwill Industries sell literally tons of rejected donations to major profit-making companies who in turn ship them overseas for sale to poorer nations in a process that compromises any clear definition of charity and exposes Americans to accusations of cultural colonization.
So, increased secondhand donations have always come with an increase in firsthand consumption, in keeping with Americans' rather bulimic relationship to things.
In her book, Kondo also explains the origin of her practice of ""greeting the home,"" which involves her kneeling and bowing in a solemn, two-minute ritual that begins the ""celebration"" Kondo believes tidying can be. Her treatment of home spaces as sacred stems from time spent In Shinto shrines -- she spent five years as an attendant maiden in one. On television, this practice is used to cutely demonstrate the cultural differences between Kondo and her patrons -- in keeping with, as a recent New York Times opinion piece puts it, a tradition of ""Japan marketing itself as a spiritual foil to a soulless West."" America's long-standing love affair with hyper-consumption cannot be so easily undone, a truth surely known by proponents of the KonMari brand; demand for the pretty little storage boxes KonMari sells for $89 a set is so high that they are currently very hard to get.
The show does offer some brilliant practical tips on storage (my own folding habits are personally revolutionized), but the biggest takeaway point is one of immediate interpersonal gratification: throw out a bunch of stuff, and you'll stop bickering with your partner! My suspicion is that the appeal of decluttering as inspired by Kondo's television show will prove as superficial as the show itself.","Marie Kondo's Netflix show has launched a torrent of conversation, ranging from indignant and misquoting memes (Only 30 books?!) to tweets about the hilarious Netflix glitch that paired Kondo's show title with an AK-47-wielding gunman in the desert.",2019-02-04T13:02:26Z,Why Marie Kondo's Netflix show won't actually change us,CNN,0
"President Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow sat down for an interview for the latest episode of The Investigation,"" an ABC News podcast focused on the probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. A transcript of Sekulow's interview as it appears in the episode of the podcast follows here:
ABC NEWS' KYRA PHILLIPS: Jay, thanks so much for being here.
JAY SEKULOW: Thanks for having me.
PHILLIPS: Let's get right to it.
SEKULOW: Yep.
PHILLIPS: OK?
SEKULOW: Sure.
PHILLIPS: I mean Trump and the White House. You made it clear that this report - complete exoneration. But is it really? Because the special counsel states while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him.
SEKULOW: This is as to the obstruction allegation?
PHILLIPS: Yes.
SEKULOW: So, let me put it in context what happens here. The special counsel is part of the United States Department of Justice unlike when Ken Starr was the independent counsel and they operate independently outside the Department of Justice guidelines. The special counsel - because no one liked the way the whole Whitewater-Clinton investigation went. There was bipartisan support to get away from that approach. They went with a special counsel regulation. So, he is part of the Department of Justice, so here's what happens. He comes - the special counsel investigates us for two years. They have these conclusions of facts he calls and the quote was difficult facts and law. Both are difficult. So, you've got difficult facts and law. He could not come to a conclusion on the obstruction issue. He says he uses the word, while we're not charging the pres - would not say that there was criminality here. We're not in a position to exonerate. That's an interesting line, by the way, because exonerate is normally not what a prosecutor does.
ABC NEWS' JOHN SANTUCCI: What is the word they should use, though?
SEKULOW: Decline. Because that's what it is.
SANTUCCI: Right.
SEKULOW: I mean that's normally what you would say. But Bill Barr said in there, they were out they were operating at that point outside of normal prosecutorial judgment here. In other words, what they did was they could not make the decision and they did what's appropriate within the Department of Justice guidelines. So, they took the issue to what it appears - based on everything I'm reading - to the Office of Legal Counsel which is the institutional agency inside the Department of Justice that looks at novel theories of law and complex facts and makes a determination whether that is something that would be actionable or not. And in this particular case it was not just the OLC. It was the OLC - Office of Legal Counsel, the Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who's been involved in it from the outset, and then also ultimately Bill Barr.
PHILLIPS: In your opinion, was this a weak move?
SEKULOW: Well, I dont - you know, you say he's getting criticized for it. Right? Because he didn't make the conclusion, but he didn't make the conclusions 
PHILLIPS: Cause its like you are not guilty. But you're also not innocent?
SEKULOW: Yeah. And again you know if this was a normal case it would be a declination. I mean that's what it would be they just would have issued one sentence saying - because we could, we could not, you know, we were dealing with difficult issues of law and fact we declined. He decided not to go there. That was the prerogative of the special counsel. It's not the prerogative of the Department of Justice, though, they have to put it back within how they operate.
ABC NEWS' CHRIS VLASTO: Let me ask you - Ty Cobb came on this podcast and he said that Bob Mueller was an American hero.
SEKULOW: Yep.
VLASTO: Do you agree?
SEKULOW: I'm not going to get into the personal, you know, positions on how I feel about Bob Mueller or anybody else. I will say this - I am glad that Bob Mueller concluded the investigation. I am glad that and pleased that my client, which we knew from the outset there was no collusion, that the determination ultimately by the Department of Justice that there was no obstruction. I think some of the things that took place under Bob Muellers watch were not good. And I think anybody that was fair and objective would have said that the conversations between the lead agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page was inappropriate and it was there - that took place for months while they were working there and Ive always ask the question what happened to that evidence that was gathered in that six month or six week period? Then, their phones were wiped clean. I just think those were unusual things. I'm not going to - I'm not going to take a personal attack on Bob Mueller. I respect that Bob Muellers service to the United States, in the military, as a lawyer, I'm not going to get into that. You know my job is? My job was to defend my client. And that's what my job.
VLASTO: But do you think we're going to be wait - do think we're going to be in a situation now where the Democrats who have been saying that Bob Mueller was a hero. Now, they're going to start criticizing him and now Republicans are going to go the other way?
SEKULOW: So here's what I tell my friends in the House and Senate that are wanting to do these oversight hearings. OK, here's what Bob Mueller got. 2,800 subpoenas, he executed 500 search warrants, obtained 230 orders for communication records, issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers you know, its following phone numbers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses. And if you take them just at their word, of what Bob Mueller said in his reported here no obstruction and a difficult questions of law in fact and ultimately the department of justice saying no obstruction. So no collusion, no obstruction. Why are the House and Senate gonna put all these people that had been subject to this for two years and have their lives turned upside down -most of which were not, you know, we know the few that have been charged, but we know 500 have not been and put their lives upside down again for a political theater. I think it is really, really wrong.
SANTUCCI: But Jay you are one of the 81 individuals that were contacted by the House Judiciary Committee.
SEKULOW: Yes. Yes.
SANTUCCI: Do you comply now?
SEKULOW: Well, look - what they asked me for it was easy for me to respond to. So what they asked me for was information that I had, documents that they said that may be in your possession that you turned over to the special counsel. Well as the - I'm not the White House counsel, I'm the private lawyer, so I don't have the notes between you know this individual in the White House and that individual. So my answer was to comply was easy. We did not turn over those - We didn't turn over documents to the White House.
SANTUCCI: So what's your legal advice to the Trumps?
SEKULOW: Oh I think here that - there's questions of jurisdiction. There are questions of propriety. There are questions of asked and answered - many of these witnesses have been before these committees for 20 hours to bring them back. Why would you bring a witness back in now? Let's take Senate Intel or House Intel - when they've investigated themselves for two years? They may not have like the conclusion and Bob Mueller was allowed to do his investigation unimpeded. And Bill Barr says it was the 
PHILLIPS: Should Congress get whole report?
SEKULOW: I think you do get - I mean I think what's going to happen on the report - I mean this is obviously not my call. I think what's going happened on the report is there - and I think theyre moving really - I mean this was amazingly quick because some of us were thinking over the weekend, we may be doing this for a week without seeing this. When I say this I'm holding in my hand the letter from - that Bill Barr issued. He got it on Friday at 5 o'clock and by Sunday at 5o'clock we had something. So I think that's a pretty historic. So when you look at that I think are going to move expeditiously on releasing as much material as they can consistent with the regulations. And I think that will happen.
VLASTO: Well what about, you know, the other thing that exists there are many prosecutors are pleading - How many people pled guilty like Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, and now there's even the Roger Stone case. Do you think the president will pardon them now?
SEKULOW: I've had no conversations with anybody about pardons. That's not something that's on the table or being discussed. Look, there's no question the president has the authority to pardon we know that. I mean that's just what the Constitution says. But there's no ongoing conversations in this regard. And I think that whether the president were ever to decide to exercise it - that would really be something that would be handled internally within the Department of Justice and the White House really the White House prerogative.
VLASTO: Right but -
SEKULOW: Certainly not the private counsel.
VLASTO: No, but when you look also though at the Roger Stone case that's going to happen in November. Here's a guy who maybe lied, maybe lied, about something that wasn't a crime.
SEKULOW: Right.
VLASTO: Right? So its -
SEKULOW: So, theyre going to prosecute him for that.
VLASTO: Well, yeah. Its, it's --
SEKULOW: I mean, thats, to me that's you know I think it raises a lot of issues if I was his defense lawyers. There's a lot of issues I would raise going through that. I'm sure, he does have a very good defense lawyers and I'm sure they'll do the appropriate thing in his defense. That's not my job that's not my call. But they have defenses.
PHILLIPS: Chuck Schumer is wanting to see all the source material.
SEKULOW: Yeah.
PHILLIPS: The investigative file.
SEKULOW: Right.
PHILLIPS: What do you think about that?
SEKULOW: Well that's up to that's really up to the Department of Justice because we have separation of powers here and each branch of government has a different function and what they can show that they're comfortable showing. They certainly shouldn't be showing 6e material. Because if you were a prosecutor or I was a prosecutor and we released to the public 6e material we would be committing a crime.
PHILLIPS: I would think the White House wouldn't want all of that released. I mean Don McGahn talked for 30 hours. I mean is that something?
SEKULOW: I mean theres executive privilege material - I mean they let him go in. But they did not waive executive privilege. I think all of that has to be looked at. But, again that's going to be the job of a Pat Cipollone and Emmett flood and the president with the Department of Justice. That's not a job that I will have or any of my colleagues.
PHILLIPS: Because if it is not all released isn't Congress going to step forward and say well what are you hiding? What's the White House hiding? We should be able to see everything.
SEKULOW: Well, let's be real. But let's take that step by step. Let's start with what was the big issue in all of this. What started this? Russian collusion with the Trump campaign or associates of Trump campaign. And there's one thing that's crystal clear in this document. There was none. That was the - and we had members of Congress go on your network and other networks saying we know it, the evidence is right there, we're seeing it, we have it, we know there's more than collusion, since somebody called it treason and it all focused on that meeting in Trump Tower in June of 2017 and the end result of all of that - the end result of all of this issue, was there was nothing there.
SANTUCCI: You know Jay when you look back over the last year -
SEKULOW: That may be 2016, I may have had the year wrong.
SANTUCCI: No it was 2016. The - when you look back over the stretch, I mean you are the only member of the legal team that survived round one.
SEKULOW: Sole survivor.
SANTUCCI: Yeah you're the sole survivor the only one still on the ship.
SEKULOW: I have a theory about that.
SANTUCCI: What's that?
SEKULOW: You know I'm a drummer. So -
SANTUCCI: We've heard this.
PHILLIPS: I knew this was coming in here somewhere. Then hes going to plug his band
SANTUCCI: Going to do a concert.
PHILLIPS: And next thing you know hes going to be live on GMA concert series.
SANTUCCI: Totally. Yeah, exactly.
SEKULOW: You go to Facebook and you look up the Jay Sekulow band you would see really good music on Facebook.
SANTUCCI: Want to give your website too while we're here?
SEKULOW: No the band just go to Facebook. Jay Sekulow band Facebook.
PHILLIPS: Did you bring your drums?
SEKULOW: Huh? I did not. But here's the thing. I think that - look I've worked with a lot of great lawyers over the last two years on this and I think I had - kept the right tempo.
SANTUCCI: OK, theres your little drumming reference there.
SEKULOW: Kept the tempo.
SANTUCCI: If I can for a second, though, you know, just thinking about all the things that you guys fought over this year with special counsel right? You've been in there with Bob Mueller, you've been in there with James Quarles his chief deputy. You know one of the things that we saw play out for quite some time is that your client did not want to sit for an interview. You fought that tooth and nail.
SEKULOW: Well, I will tell you his lawyers didn't want him to sit for an interview. He was convinced early on that he wanted to sit for an interview
SANTUCCI: That changed though.
SEKULOW: That changed when his lawyer said that's not how it works.
SANTUCCI: Are you surprised -
PHILLIPS: But also John Dowd was a little nervous, remember John Dowd told us they were a little nervous of Trump not having scripted responses.
SEKULOW: Well, let me tell you this, If I was representing you and they asked to go speak to you, voluntarily. You know what I would tell them? No. Because that's what a lawyer would do. Why would I do that? You're not going to - especially if you had the compulsion percentages were so low. And here the compulsion percentages were so low because they had a difficult time making a subpoena claim.
SANTUCCI: But here's my question though, for all the pressure and the back and forth that you had for the last two years to this - are you surprised that the president did not ultimately get forced to sit for an interview? Wasnt subpoenaed by Bob Mueller?
SEKULOW: I think one thing that Ty and John did well was they gave a - they did a lot of things well - but the providing that amount of material and that amount of witness interviews under the Espy standard which is the District of Columbia D.C. Court of Appeals standard on when you could really interview someone like a president. You have to show that you could not get the information from any place else, so I think they may have had an internal conversation within the special counsel's office and DOJ. It never - obviously never raised to a level of where the acting attorney general had to override them. So, that means they didn't go with a formal request for the interview.
SANTUCCI: But it's interesting you say that because we saw over the course of this probe many people actually criticized Ty Cobb for opening house - giving so many documents, letting so many people sit down. So in hindsight that actually seemed in your mind to be a good move now?
SEKULOW: I always thought cooperation was smart, but cooperation didn't mean we're just going to send the president over and say OK here's four hours talk to the president of the United States, especially when you've given all of that information. So, I think what John and Ty put forward in the beginning of this served the country and the president well.
VLASTO: Obviously Donald Trump had a really good weekend. But, you know, there was another thing that happened, though, last week that doesnt bode too well for the president. Those search warrants that were filed in the Michael Cohen case that were still redacted. That actually suggested, that, that investigation is still ongoing. What do you make of that? Is the president does the president have exposure on that?
SEKULOW: No, I mean look, we've got really competent lawyers that are handling the Southern District claim on the campaign. That is - I personally, as someone that litigated the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, it was called McCain-Feingold. I did that case at the Supreme Court of the United States, challenging provisions of it. I - the challenge, the provisions I challenge I won unanimously, struck them unanimously - to make that into a campaign - Michael Cohen pled to a non-crime. That's what he pled - cause in any other context. It was not like it was campaign money utilized, so he pled to a non-crime that was his decision. His lawyers decision thats not for me to question -
VLASTO: Why do you think they redacted it though?
SEKULOW: Well that doesn't mean - it doesn't mean that they're not looking at it. That they're not done with it. But I am not of the view that that's going anywhere. I am of the view that that's not going anywhere.
SANTUCCI: So then Jay when you do look at the prospect of him, I mean we just panned this out right? You've got well over half a dozen congressional investigations in the House and the Senate, you have SDNY with the campaign, you have SDNY also looking into the Trump inaugural, youve got about five -
SEKULOW: Now on that one, let me say something about the inaugural.
SANTUCCI: Go with that one, sure.
SEKULOW: So that is, you know, because as a separate entity were completely not involved in that at all.
PHILLIPS: So, youve not been involved in that at all?
SANTUCCI: So, youve not been contacted?
SEKULOW: We're not involved in that at all.
SANTUCCI: So no requests? We saw a subpoena go to the inaugural committee, but nothing to Donald Trump, the Trump family, the Trump organization nobody.
SEKULOW: Correct. Right.
SANTUCCI: But now what about the other state cases we see? You have a hard charging state attorney in New York. I mean Donald Trump says his home state is going to be the one to hurt him the hardest when this is all over. But they are actively trying to bring witnesses in from the Trump organization come and speak with them.
SEKULOW: This is, on the, are you talking about on the state?
SANTUCCI: Yeah. New York state agent.
SEKULOW: So some of that's on the charity. So, again, which is a civil thing not a criminal matter. I think look there's a lot of news reports about what's actually happening. But as someone that knows what's happening, because Im one of the lawyers involved in what's happening, I could tell you that what has been reported is not accurate. As far as the scope and nature of documents that are coming or request for documents because it's nothing like that.
SANTUCCI: So, you don't feel that many people believe that is a wide ranging massive investigation. You don't sense that?
SEKULOW: Well, look. Here's what I would say. The fact is that if the investigation is based on Michael Cohen's testimony who pled to perjury and then went before the United States Congress and perjured himself again that, that would be hard pressed for the Southern District - its again going to reliable evidence, is probably not a really good move and I think smart prosecutors would say maybe that's not so smart.
PHILLIPS: Are Democrats ever going to see Donald Trump as a legitimate president?
SEKULOW: Well they may have no choice because he may see him for another six years and I think, look I think, this invest -- if the basis of illegitimacy was this notion of collusion with Russia, which is what it was. I think that has been completely dismissed here. You know the obstruction, remember, was kind of the after the effect.
PHILLIPS: But everybodys hammering open, hammering this open question of obstruction. That's what everybody talking about and hammering.
SEKULOW: Yeah, but that's a different question. So, the illegitimacy
PHILLIPS: Dems are going to hammer that all the way to November 3rd 2020.
SEKULOW: They got to be careful because I think there's going to be a wear out period here. The Supreme Court of the United States, when theyve looked at obstruction cases, if you look at what happened in obstruction cases over the last - I'm a Supreme Court litigator. Over the last 20 years, most obstruction cases have been reversed 9 to 0. And I think what happened here. The Department of Justice wasn't going to take some novel theory of obstruction of justice and roll it roll the dice against the president of the United States.
VLASTO: Well, and also it becomes a political issue of which already now the attorney general and Rod Rosenstein, also, you know made a decision. So, you're not going to get enough votes.
SEKULOW: Of course not.
VLASTO: So. So in Congress to impeach him on obstruction that would be ridiculous.
SEKULOW: Right. Well I think so what they're going to. So, I think this over investigating mentality after the Mueller report and after the scope of nature of what they were able to get with it. Like I said, the thousands of subpoenas and hundreds of witnesses, it only makes it not only makes the house redundant it makes it look really vindictive.
SANTUCCI: So, there's one document that, correct me if I'm wrong that Bob Mueller did not get. Donald Trump's tax returns. We know Congress wants them.
SEKULOW: Did not ask for them.
SANTUCCI: OK. Now what about Congress? They're going for it. We know ways and means is already drafting letters
SEKULOW: they're going to ask for them.
SANTUCCI: And do youre the lawyer.
SEKULOW: Theres rules and regulations on disclosure of tax reforms even to the government.
SANTUCCI: OK, so now, but in this fight you're going to defend the president since the president the individual with his tax returns, right?
SEKULOW: So, sure. Thered be a joint interest there - between the White House because they would have Article Two issues that they would raise - a sitting president having his tax returns taken by a committee. And then of course as private lawyers you represent the taxpayer. So, in that the particular case is the President
SANTUCCI: OK, so, pull out your crystal ball. Do Democrats get the tax return?
SEKULOW: I don't think so.
SANTUCCI: Why?
SEKULOW: Because the law will not - what is the investigative purpose for them to have his tax returns? Because all of these committee sit. They have to have jurisdiction. Right? They have to have what is the causal, colorable claim that you're investigating impacting legislation? And what is the legislation? Are they going to pass the Donald Trump Tax Reform Act? Well, they're not.
VLASTO: Could they use that New York Times story that came out over the last year of that showed -
SEKULOW: Going back 35 years.
VLASTO: Well. But -
SEKULOW: Statues of limitations have long expired on that. And again that was that was a story that did not have the lawyers that represented Fred Trump, the father, presenting cases. No, I don't think so, I think wheres the. What is the legit the standard is on these inquiries - what's the legitimate legislative purpose? What is their legislative purpose in asking for the tax return? And that probably gets litigated.
PHILLIPS: Dont we want to know how he spent his money? If he - if there is no sign of tax fraud, I mean we want to know about his financials, we want to know about his real estate.
SEKULOW: But we would be the Internal Revenue Service. We would not be the United States Congress. They're not investigators. As far as conducting investigations on individuals, they can't call you and say we want you to, we want to take, we know the IRS audited you were ready and cleared you. We don't really like that. So, we want your tax returns. How would you feel about that? Not so good. Right? Because why you just went through an IRS audit, because theyre agency charged with doing that investigation. Not the United States Congress.
PHILLIPS: I've been through an audit. It's no fun.
SEKULOW: I was an IRS lawyer.
PHILLIPS: You were probably the one that went after me, thanks Jay.
SEKULOW: No I wasn't, because Im much older than you were when it was a long time ago.
VLASTO: All right. Are you done now? Is your job over?
SEKULOW: No, it is it changes. Obviously, this was a big issue on my plate. That has been removed and I'm very grateful, as is my family and my grandkids that this is now done. My grandson told me yesterday he said good job papa. I said thank you. My granddaughters were sending me videos. And that was nice.
VLASTO: But wait what did Donald Trump say to you?
SEKULOW: He's very pleased. I mean I don't want to ever disclose conversations that were obviously that would be sensitive that - I could tell you that he's very pleased with the conclusion.
PHILLIPS: Does he want you to stay on and help with the other investigations?
SEKULOW: Yes, yes. I mean the president wants us to continue. I mean especially in the Congressional stuff. I'm a tax lawyer, so if the tax returns become an issue those are my kind of things too.
SANTUCCI: Last question you've argued before the Supreme Court. You've had a storied career. You were telling me that your father passed away right before you got hired to be Donald Trump's lawyer. Where does this rank for you in your career?
SEKULOW: Well, Ill tell you, the most important case I ever handled. Clearly number one. I said to you, John, that my dad passed away about a month before I was retained by the president. And my father was a political junkie. I mean he loved politics he followed it and he would have - he lived in they lived in Boca Raton and then he moved to we were from New York and Long Island - he moved down to Boca. And my mother passed away about 20 years before and my dad and I was very close with my mother too my dad and I were really close, and he - theres a Yiddish expression he could Kvell in this stuff. This would - I could see him. They sit around me like the poker table in Boca or in the villages and he'd be saying what does your son do? Well my son is a doctor. Oh is he the head of the department? Well OK. What does your son do? He represents the president. So, yesterday when all this hit, I told this to my wife last night. When I got back, I spoke to you and I was it was late and I told my wife last night. I said I really miss my dad. I mean I think this would have been - this would've been something I really would want to share with dad. But I will say this that my two boys who are both men with children, are grown adults with children were great yesterday. My oldest is a lawyer and worked on the case and he was very excited, but also very kind of emotional he sent me a nice note about my grandkids, my youngest son, who runs a lot of our media operations. He's a comedian also. And it's funny, but they said this is for your grandchildren, was a big moment. And I look, I wanted it to end well for my client, I wanted it to end well for the country. I think look, one thing if Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Green Party, whatever you are, I think one good news here that everybody can agree on no Russian collusion with a campaign. I think that's good for the American people.

"WINSLOW, Neb./CHICAGO (Reuters) - Midwestern farmers have been gambling they could ride out the U.S.-China trade war by storing their corn and soybeans anywhere they could - in bins, plastic tubes, in barns or even outside. 
Now, the unthinkable has happened. Record floods have devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt across Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and several other states. Early estimates of lost crops and livestock are approaching $1 billion in Nebraska alone. With more flooding expected, damages are expected to climb much higher for the region. 
As river levels rose, spilling over levees and swallowing up townships, farmers watched helplessly as the waters consumed not only their fields, but their stockpiles of grain, the one thing that can stand between them and financial ruin. 
“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” said Tom Geisler, a farmer in Winslow, Nebraska, who said he lost two full storage bins of corn. “We had been depending on the income from our livestock, but now all of our feed is gone, so that is going to be even more difficult. We haven’t been making any money from our grain farming because of trade issues and low prices.” 
The pain does not end there. As the waters began to recede in parts of Nebraska, the damage to the rural roads, bridges and rail lines was just beginning to emerge. This infrastructure is critical for the U.S. agricultural sector to move products from farms to processing plants and shipping hubs. 
The damage to roads means it will be harder for trucks to deliver seed to farmers for the coming planting season, but in some areas, the flooding on fields will render them all-but-impossible to use. 
The deluge is the latest blow for the Farm Belt, which has faced several crises in the last five years, as farm incomes have fallen by more than 50 percent due to a global grain glut. President Donald Trump’s trade policies cut off exports of soybeans and other products, making the situation worse. 
Soybeans were the single most valuable U.S. agricultural export crop and until the trade war, China bought $12 billion worth a year from American farmers. But Chinese tariffs have almost halted the trade, leaving farmers with crops they are struggling to sell for a profit. 
CORN AND SOYBEANS DESTROYED 
As prices plummeted last year amid the ongoing trade fight, growers, faced with selling crops at a loss, stuffed a historic volume of grain into winding plastic tubes and steel bins. Some cash-strapped families piled crops inside their barns or outside on the ground. 
Farmers say they are now finding storage bags torn and bins burst open, grain washed away or contaminated. Jeff Jorgenson, a farmer and regional director for the Iowa Soybean Association, said he has seen at least a dozen bins that burst after grains swelled when they became wet. 
Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration policy, flood-soaked grain is considered adulterated and must be destroyed, according to Iowa State University. 
Some farmers had been waiting for corn prices to rise just 10 cents a bushel more before making sales, which would earn them a few extra thousand dollars, Jorgenson said. 
“That’s the toughest pill to swallow,” Jorgenson said. “This could end their career of farming and the legacy of the family farm.” 
As of Dec. 1, producers in states with flooding - including South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin and Illinois - had 6.75 billion bushels of corn, soybeans and wheat stored on their farms - 38 percent of the total U.S. supplies available at that time, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
Iowa suffered at least $150 million in damage to agricultural buildings and machinery, and 100,000 acres of farm land are under water, said Keely Coppess, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. 
EXTENT OF DAMAGE UNCLEAR 
The record flooding has killed at least four people in the Midwest and left one person missing. The extent of damage is unknown as meteorologists expect more flooding in coming weeks. 
Early estimates put flood damage at $400 million in losses for Nebraska’s cow-calf industry and another $440 million in crop losses, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts told a news conference on Wednesday. 
“The water came so fast,” said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. “We know our farmers didn’t have enough time to move all the cattle or empty all their grain bins.” 
Multiple washouts and high water on BNSF Railway Co’s main lines have caused major disruption across parts of the Midwest, the company warned on its website. The flooding also has disrupted part of Hormel Foods Corp’s supply chain, the company told Reuters.

The roads are so bad that Nebraska’s National Guard on Wednesday will push hay out of a military helicopter to feed cattle in Colfax County stranded by floodwaters, Major General Daryl Bohac said. It is the first time in at least half a century that such an air drop has been conducted, he said. 
Cattle carcasses have been found tangled in debris or rotting in trees, while tractors and other expensive machinery are stuck in mud, unable to be moved. 
“We should have been getting into planting for next season, but now all of our equipment is flooded and it’s going to take at least three to four weeks to bring back that equipment into shape,” said Geisler, the farmer in Winslow, Nebraska.

"(Reuters) - The post-Christmas blizzard that left at least two people dead in the U.S. Midwest and stranded thousands of travelers has fizzled to heavy rain storms that will soak swaths of the southeast, Gulf Coast and New England through the weekend, the National Weather Service said. 
“It’s bringing a lot of rain, we have flash flood watches and warnings throughout the East coast, but basically, this is petering out,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the NWS Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. 
“Think lots of rain, some ice, but I can’t say this is such a dangerous event any more,” Hurley said. 
After dumping more than 6-to-10 inches of snow on the Midwest, the storm dropped about 5 inches of rain in Biloxi, Mississippi, and 4 inches of rain on Baton Rouge, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast late Thursday and into Friday, forecasters said. 
Hurley said that the storm weakens as it spreads eastward. About 2 inches of rain dropped on Atlanta and north Georgia with another inch or so left to come. 
About an inch will drop on western New York and Pennsylvania and turn into freezing rain in northern New England. 
“There are still some challenges, but it’s no longer a blizzard event,” Hurley said. 
But the Midwest was still digging out of the snow the blizzard left in parts of Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. 
A state of emergency was still in effect in Kansas early Friday. 
A motorist was killed in Kansas on Thursday in a crash blamed on the storm which also caused the cancellation or delays of thousands of airline flights and injured two people on a commercial jet over the Dallas area. 
A 58-year-old woman in Louisina was killed Wednesday when a tree fell on her trailer, CNN and other media reported. 
But air traffic was slowly returning to normal early Friday with about 300 flights canceled and about 3,000 delayed for an hour or more, according to the tracking website FlightAware.com, down from a height of 7,000 delays. 
The Kansas Division of Emergency Management warned motorists early Friday to stay off the roads. 
And if you have to travel, “stay safe and take it slow,” it posted on the Internet.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Insurance companies do not need any help marketing Medicare Advantage plans - just ask anyone over age 65 about the pitches that clog their mailboxes every year during the fall enrollment period, or check out the television ads that flood cable channels. So why is the federal government giving these private all-in-one plans an extra marketing push? That is the question raised by two consumer advocacy groups, who charge that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is improperly urging enrollees to pick Advantage plans in ways that tip the scales against traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans roll together coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services and prescription drugs that are provided through separate parts of traditional Medicare. In a letter sent last month to CMS Administrator Seema Verma, the Medicare Rights Center and the Center for Medicare Advocacy criticize a suite of online tools on the Medicare website that aim to help consumers decide between Advantage and traditional Medicare. The tools make “overly-broad suggestions” that encourage Advantage enrollment when “more nuance is required, and by failing to present individuals with the full array of Medicare coverage options,” the letter states. The consumer groups also say that a CMS email campaign during fall enrollment (which ends on Dec. 7) is improperly biased toward Advantage plans. The campaign includes messages with subject lines such as “Could Medicare Advantage be right for you?” and “Get more benefits for your money,” and contain messages such as “check out Medicare Advantage.” CMS did not respond to requests for comment on perceptions that its Advantage promotions lack balance, or who it regards as the target audience. This is not the first time CMS has been accused of bias in favor of Advantage. Earlier this year, advocacy groups called foul over language contained in a draft of the 2019 Medicare handbook that CMS sends to enrollees every year. ( reut.rs/2J6D9l1 ) CMS later responded by fixing the language in the final draft of its handbook ""Medicare &amp; You."" Advantage plans differ from traditional fee-for-service Medicare in several ways. They receive capped per-enrollee payments from the federal government, rather than the fee-for service model used in the traditional program. Advantage plans must cap enrollees’ out-of-pocket expenses; and most wrap in prescription drug coverage. Beneficiaries typically must use a network of providers, while enrollees in traditional Medicare can see any healthcare provider that accepts Medicare - and most do. Advantage plans often save money for enrollees on premiums, since most pay no additional fee for prescription drug coverage and do not need Medigap supplemental policies, which cap out-of-pocket costs. And the business is doing just fine without cheerleading by CMS. Enrollment has more than tripled since 2005 to 20 million beneficiaries, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Congressional Budget Office projects enrollment will rise from 34 percent to 42 percent of the Medicare population by 2028. The companies running plans are enjoying a boom in revenue - for example, UnitedHealth Group Inc, the nation’s largest seller of Medicare Advantage plans, reported a 15.2 percent revenue jump in its Medicare business during the third quarter compared with the year-earlier period, to $18.8 billion. LOUDER CHEERLEADING The Trump administration is not the first to play the role of Advantage booster. “The past few administrations have been very much in favor of private plans,” said Gretchen Jacobson, associate director with the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicare Policy. She notes that the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, as well as Congress, have encouraged growth of the program through rulemaking and legislation that made it possible for Advantage plans to add benefits such as vision care and gym memberships, and to cap patient out-of-pocket costs. At the same time, regulators have given Advantage plans greater latitude to set their own rules for certain types of coverage. But the current round of government support for Advantage plans is louder than anything seen in earlier administrations, said Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center. “I’ve been involved in Medicare since 1994, and I can’t remember this kind of government promotion for a particular part of the program,” he said. Baker adds that his group has no problem with CMS providing education to consumers - but only if it is balanced. “People have two options, and CMS should be communicating about the advantages and disadvantages of both - this approach is lopsided.” The motivations are not clear, Jacobson said. A research paper she co-authored recently in the New England Journal of Medicine ( bit.ly/2ARMyqo ) concludes that evidence is mixed as to whether Advantage saves the government money or is actually increasing government spending. The jury also is out on the quality of care provided by Advantage plans, Jacobson’s study found, especially for people with serious chronic conditions. These patients are disenrolling from Advantage plans at high rates, according to numerous rigorous research studies. “That is a real concern as Advantage enrollment grows,” she said.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Heavy rains and the threat of mudslides in Southern California forced the closure of a key coastal highway near Malibu on Thursday and prompted authorities to order evacuations of almost 3,000 residents from hillside areas scarred by recent wildfires. The same Pacific storm also brought snow to the region’s high country, leading to the temporary closure of a stretch of Interstate 5 called the Grapevine, a major truck route that traverses a mountain pass north of Los Angeles, officials said. The storm, which led the National Weather Service to issue flash-flood warnings for parts of Southern California, heightened concerns about the long-term risk of mudslides and debris flows around communities where wildfires have stripped foothills and canyon slopes of vegetation. Last month, the Woolsey Fire incinerated 1,500 buildings and charred 97,000 acres (39,000 hectares) in the upscale coastal enclave of Malibu and adjacent areas near Los Angeles, leaving large swaths of hilly landscape vulnerable to slides and flooding. “The fires have generated some risks that we need to be aware of and be cautious of for several years into the future,” Cindy Matthews, a senior National Weather Service hydrologist, said. About 2,700 people were ordered evacuated from Lake Elsinore and surrounding Riverside County communities about 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles, where rains threatened to unleash rivers of mud, boulders and other debris down hillsides, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Captain Fernando Herrera. Some mud flows occurred on Thursday in the area, burned earlier this year by the Holy fire, but no major property damage was reported, Herrera said. The threat of mudslides in the Woolsey Fire zone around Malibu was not deemed severe enough to trigger evacuations there, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Tony Imbrenda said. However, as a heavy debris flow smothered a nearby section of Pacific Coast Highway, forcing authorities to close that stretch of the scenic highway for a few hours. In all, the storm dumped more than 3 inches (8 cm) of rain in some parts of Southern California, according to the National Weather Service.

"LOS ANGELES A powerful winter storm unleashed mudslides in Southern California wildfire burn areas and trapped motorists on a major highway, and the northern part of the state braced for more wet weather Sunday.
Saturday's deluge loosened hillsides where a major blaze burned last year in and around Malibu, clogging the Pacific Coast Highway with mud and debris.
A stretch of the scenic route northwest of Los Angeles was expected to remain closed in both directions until Monday while crews tow away stuck vehicles and clear lanes. No injuries were reported.
The rapper Soulja Boy was among those whose cars were mired in the muck that was up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep in some areas.
The 28-year-old retweeted a photo of the mudslide and posted: ""My car got stuck too almost went into the ocean,"" along with a prayer emoji.
An automated rain gauge in the western Santa Monica Mountains showed nearly three-quarters of an inch (nearly 2 centimeters) of rainfall in one hour, said the National Weather Service.
""These are heavy rates,"" the weather service tweeted.
Up to 1 ½ inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain fell in coastal and valley areas, while mountain communities got heavy snow.
Flash-flood watches and warnings were eventually lifted for areas burned by the fires that scorched more than 155 square miles (404 square kilometers) of brush and timber acres in November, destroyed about 1,600 structures and claimed three lives.
The sun emerged in Los Angeles on Sunday and the red carpet for the evenings Golden Globe awards were expected to remain dry. Scattered showers were possible later in the night.
To the north, wind and rain forced delays or cancelations of flights out of San Francisco International Airport for a second day. A wind advisory was in place until 10 p.m. Sunday.
The San Francisco Bay Area could get up to 1 ½ inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain, with the heaviest downpours coming after sunset.
Saturday's storm brought about a foot (30 centimeters) of snow to the Sierra Nevada and twice that amount was expected Sunday. A winter storm warning was in effect until 4 a.m. Monday.
Avalanche warnings were posted in parts of California, Nevada and Utah. The Sierra Avalanche Center issued a backcountry avalanche warning for the Lake Tahoe area stretching south into the Sierra along the California-Nevada line from noon Sunday until 7 a.m. Monday.
The National Weather Service says blizzard conditions with gale-force winds could trigger widespread avalanche activity.
Two feet (61 centimeters) of snow was reported at Mammoth Mountain 150 miles (241.39 kilometers) south of Tahoe. More than a foot (30 centimeters) fell in the upper elevations around Tahoe, including 19 inches (48 cm) at Squaw Valley.
Windstorms that pummeled parts of Washington state and Oregon over the weekend left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity.
A strong system brought winds that registered gusts of about 60 mph (96 kph) at Sea-Tac Airport in Washington, the National Weather Service in Seattle said. Dozens of flights in the region were canceled or delayed.","California highway closed by mudslides, more rain coming Fox News Soulja Boy Involved in Car Accident Due to Southern California Mudslides: ""My Car Got Stuck"" PEOPLE.com California mudslides shut down Pacific Coast Highway, ensnare motorists including rapper …",2019-01-06T20:57:27Z,"California highway closed by mudslides, more rain coming - Fox News",Fox News,1
"AURORA, Ill. Eight years after an Illinois boy disappeared, his family began to think that their nightmare might be over at last.
A young man found wandering the streets of a Kentucky town claimed he had just escaped from two men in the Cincinnati area who held him captive for seven years. And he told police his name was Timmothy Pitzen. It didn't seem possible that someone so far away could make up such a story. So for a day and a half, relatives waited and hoped for a breakthrough.
Then on Thursday came devastating word from the FBI: DNA tests showed that the person was not Timmothy, a boy from Aurora who vanished at age 6 in 2011, around the time of his mother's suicide.
""It's like reliving that day all over again, and Timmothy's father is devastated once again, as are we,"" said the boy's aunt Kara Jacobs, her voice choked with emotion.
Authorities said the person claiming to be 14-year-old Timmothy was actually a 23-year-old ex-convict who was recently released from an Ohio prison after serving time for burglary and vandalism.
Neither Jacobs nor the boy's grandmother Alana Anderson tried to hide their disappointment as they struggled for composure during a brief news conference outside Anderson's home in Antioch, about 60 miles north of Aurora.
Anderson said her prayer has always been that when Timmothy was old enough, ""he would find us if we couldn't find him."" She held out hope that if he's ""in a place where he has communication with the media or a computer, that he'll remember us enough to look for us, and I think he will. He's a very smart guy.""
The rest of Aurora seemed to share in the family's disappointment.
""I know the community won't give up that he is out there,"" said Nick Baughman, former principal at the school where Amy Fry-Pitzen took her 6-year-old son out of his kindergarten class on May 11, 2011, saying something about a family emergency.
Wearing his backpack, Timmothy waved to his classmates, saying ""See you tomorrow,"" teacher Cheryl Broach recalled.
The two climbed into Fry-Pitzen's SUV and went on an adventure that included a visit to the Brookfield Zoo outside Chicago, a suburban Chicago resort and another resort in the Wisconsin Dells, a region that calls itself the ""Waterpark Capital of the World.""
The next day, according to video footage released later by police, the boy and his mother were seen leaving the Kalahari Resorts in the Dells. That was the last time the two were seen together. When Fry-Pitzen checked into a motel in Rockford, Illinois, about 120 miles away, on May 13, she was alone, according to police.
The next afternoon, her body turned up but with no sign of her son. A note she left said the boy was being cared for by someone who loved him in a place where he would never be found.
In the first days of the search, police said they found a significant amount of blood in the SUV's back seat, and tests confirmed it was the boy's. That news initially terrified Anderson, but the boy's father explained that his son had a history of nosebleeds and had suffered a serious one just days before he disappeared.
At Greenman Elementary, classmates, teachers and parents tried to help by tying hundreds of yellow ribbons around trees and signs. A garden was planted in Timmothy's memory.
""There were a lot of prayers, I recall,"" Baughman said Thursday. ""It was just one of those moments where you want to maintain hope and be supportive.""
Police tried to piece together the route Fry-Pitzen might have taken in her SUV, but in the years that followed, authorities never offered a public explanation for her actions. Reported sightings of the boy went nowhere. Investigators became frustrated by what they called hoaxes.
Family members knew that Fry-Pitzen had been troubled. A woman who was close to the family and whose children played with Timmothy said she noticed something amiss the morning he was taken out of school.
""I got to see him that morning before everything happened,"" Linda Ramirez remembered. ""She seemed very sad. I was in a hurry and I didn't stop. I just went to work. I thought I can come over later and talk to her.""
""I would love to see him again and hold him, and say that I'm sorry that I didn't stop,"" Ramirez added. ""Believe it or not, his mother loved him very, very much.""
When Fry-Pitzen died, she was on her fourth marriage, Anderson said. Her daughter had battled depression for years and was taking medication.
""She and her husband were having problems,"" Anderson said. ""We were very concerned and told her we would help her any way we could.""
In 2003, according to an account James Pitzen gave to CNN, his wife ""had taken some pills, I guess, and (had been) sitting on the edge of a cliff and supposedly passed out and fell off a cliff.""
James Pitzen, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, ultimately moved back to Iowa, Anderson said. After a while, the flood of calls between him and his wife's family slowed to a trickle before stopping altogether.
""He went on with his life,"" Anderson said. ""I think seeing us was upsetting to him.""
If there were troubles at home, they weren't obvious in the behavior of young Timmothy. He often played with her children and enjoyed their backyard trampoline. He loved to learn and talked about learning Spanish.
""He was a very happy boy with a lot of energy,"" Ramirez said. ""It was hard to keep up with him.""

"From the northern plains to the Midwest, vast areas remain underwater as a disastrous flood event continues, even days after last weeks powerhouse storm departed.
States of emergency remain in place for Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin.
Eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, where at least three deaths have occurred, have witnessed some of the worst flooding. As rivers have soared to record levels, levees have failed while bridges and thoroughfares have washed away. Numerous cities and towns are still engulfed in floodwaters.
Scenes of devastation are too numerous to fully capture, but available photographs and imagery offer a sense of the extreme nature of this event.
Waterways exploding in size
Last weeks bomb cyclone was the most powerful spring storm in the central United States in decades. In a short amount of time, it unloaded one to three inches of rain, but that by itself didnt cause the monumental flooding. There was also a ton of water packed within snow already on the ground.
As the rain poured down and this snow melted, a massive amount of water was released that ran off along the frozen turf into rivers and streams, rather than soaking into the soil. Those waterways then swelled to historic levels.
Scores of them are still at major flood stage.
The before-and-after scenes of eastern Nebraskas Elkhorn River, from the Sentinel 2 satellite (above), shows the city of Scribner turned into an island, while several nearby communities are inundated.
The river seen passing by Uehling is actually just a small creek that ballooned in size.
Pools of high standing water are apparent all around the region. Similar scenes are evident up and down the Missouri and Platte rivers, shown below.
Dam and levee failures
It just looked like the end of the world coming, Niobrara, Neb., Mayor Jody Stark told the Omaha World-Herald.
Stark was describing a wall of water more than a story tall rushing down the Niobrara River and into town when the upstream Spencer Dam was destroyed, unleashing a torrent of water loaded with huge chunks of ice. It all eventually surged into the Missouri River, where the weekend flooding was historic. Numerous levees and dikes failed, flooding nearby communities.
Unbelievable scenes on the ground
Pictures never truly do a disaster justice. But watching whitecaps atop normally dry prairies is something to behold, even on screen.
River floods can be gradual, with slow-rising water, but this is often not the case, and they can turn much more violent. In this instance, fast-moving water has scoured the landscape in sections of eastern Nebraska and surrounding states. In some places, rivers appear to have created new pathways.
Towns and cities underwater
Weather.com has put together a series of stunning before-and-after photos that are worth a look. One example is shown below.
It shows the small town of Bartlett, Iowa, situated near the Missouri River on the Nebraska border. It is completely engulfed by the flood. Scenes of such complete devastation are often reserved for major tornadoes in the region. But water can do serious damage, as well.
Numerous roads and highways damaged and destroyed

Even in places where bridges remain, theyre impassable, tweeted Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), while sharing a photo of a still-standing bridge covered in debris.
Dozens of roads throughout the region have been damaged and destroyed by flooding. Its not just small roads impacted either: Several highways have seen bridges demolished or large sections wiped from the earth by floodwaters. Storm chaser Mike Hollingshead has been keeping track of these locations in eastern Nebraska.
Islands of the Plains

Parts of the Great Plains and Midwest are thought of as being flat as a pancake. While this is true in spots, small changes in elevation can make a big difference. In addition to towns and cities being cut off and temporarily turned into islands, even smaller ones around the region became temporary refuge for livestock.
Dramatic scenes of rescue
Much as in the flooding in New Orleans caused by Hurricane Katrina or in Houston after Hurricane Harvey, emergency officials looked past personal risks to help those trapped by the rapidly rising waters.
Thousands of rescues have taken place, coordinated by multiple agencies. Chief among them are the Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol. These folks have been instrumental in saving lives, as well as giving us a better picture of whats happening in the region with their presence on social media.

The National Weather Service is tasked with saving lives and property in the face of extreme weather. On Friday, the office in Omaha, along the Missouri River, had to be evacuated. Rising waters were threatening to encircle them which later happened.
[It was a little surreal: Forecasters flee as a tornado and flood target National Weather Service offices]
They werent alone. Offutt Air Force Base, the home of U.S. Strategic Command, has also faced floodwaters covering about a third of its facility. At least one runway was partially submerged there. A nuclear power plant on the Missouri River that was threatened by flooding was able to continue operating through the weekend.
Neighbors helping neighbors
These kinds of situations have a way of highlighting the best of communities. In addition to the tireless work of law enforcement, rescue personnel and emergency management, communities have come together to assist one another in enduring this trauma.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential contender Amy Klobuchar presented a trillion-dollar plan on Thursday to fix the country’s roads, bridges and other public works that she said would be her top budget priority if elected. 
The U.S. senator’s plan would include the repair and replacement of roads and bridges, modernization of flood protection and airports, expansion of public transportation and the increase of rural access to broadband internet, among other policies. 
Klobuchar often refers to one of the worst bridge collapses in U.S. history, in her home state of Minnesota, repeating her admonition at the time that “A bridge in America just shouldn’t fall down.” An interstate highway bridge spanning the Mississippi River collapsed in 2007, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 others. 
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have long called for fixes to the United States’ infrastructure, including aging schools and water systems, but plans have foundered over disputes over how to fund the projects. 
To pay for the investments, Klobuchar said she would commit more than $650 billion in federal funding for infrastructure, partly by changing parts of the tax overhaul legislation passed in 2017 to adjust the corporate tax rate to 25 percent. 
She would establish an Infrastructure Financing Authority to help states better leverage private funds for projects and steer money to rural areas, as well as bring back a bond program to give a 35 percent subsidy to state and local governments for public projects. 
In President Donald Trump’s annual State of the Union address to Congress in February, he once again called on lawmakers to pass legislation to aid the country’s infrastructure. 
An infrastructure plan Trump asked lawmakers to support in February 2018 was roundly criticized and never received a vote in Congress, which was then controlled by his Republican Party. 
Klobuchar, who is in her third term in the U.S. Senate, is one of more than a dozen Democrats running for their party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

"The patient had come in with heart failure, and physicians at the University of California at San Francisco had an aggressive plan to help. Doctors there inserted a heart pump through his leg artery to flood his organs with blood. But there is a downside to the strategy clots can form through its use. So doctors gave the unidentified man anticoagulants to thin his blood. But his airways began to seep. He had a slow bleed that was ongoing despite the medication, Gavitt A. Woodard, a cardiothoracic surgery fellow at the university hospital, told The Washington Post. Clots formed. The patient coughed them up over days, Woodard said. They were cylindrical and minor at first, like small worms. Then the patient thundered a hard cough and ejected a blood-red tangle measuring about six inches across. Woodards team, along with fellow physician Georg Wieselthaler, carefully laid out the clot on a surgical towel. What they found was astonishing. The patients blood had pooled in his right bronchial tree part of the network where air travels through the lungs and solidified like Jell-O, Woodard said. And it came out whole and intact. No one on our team has seen anything close to this, she said. The 36-year-old patient was intubated for two days after the incident, which happened recently, Woodard said, though she declined to give any more details, citing patient privacy. He died a week later, Woodard said, but his death was unrelated to the incident. He had a host of severe conditions, and the clots he coughed up were a side effect of the medication, she said. Its beautiful anatomy, she said. Its a sad story, but its a very cool image. The clot did not help researchers advance medical knowledge, she said. But its photo has captivated people in ways medical journal articles often do not since being published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Nov. 29. The clot is also an opportunity to show how intricate the human body is, Woodard said, something everybody thought they knew until it was presented in a different way like the impossibly detailed formations of fallen ice under a microscope. ""Its like the biggest snowflake youve ever seen, Woodard said.

"The National Weather Service is known for its role in forecasting severe weather. But once in a while, it finds itself in the path of it. Twice last week, local Weather Service offices were forced to go offline to escape Mother Natures fury.
The evacuations resulted from the historic bomb cyclone that barreled through the Plains and Midwest.
Things got busy quickly Thursday morning for the Weather Service in Paducah, Ky. A line of severe storms was approaching from the west unusual for so early in the day. At 9:09 a.m., meteorologists placed extreme southwest Paducah under a tornado warning. Eighteen minutes later, they extended it to include the entire city of nearly 25,000. The Weather Service office was in the path of the tornadic storm.
It was a little surreal, said Dan Spaeth, a meteorologist at the Paducah office who was operating the radar as Thursdays storm whirled ominously close. My gut instinct told me it was going to just narrowly miss us to the south and east.""
By 9:30 a.m., a tornado had dropped and been confirmed by weather spotters. So what happens when a Weather Service office tracking the storm becomes the storms target?
Every NWS office has a backup office, Spaeth said. We have capabilities to be backed up by NWS Louisville, and if that doesnt work, NWS Springfield, Missouri. The backup office takes over issuing warnings and can handle all operations in the event of a major power or communications failure.""
There are 122 local weather forecast offices across the United States, and each has a neighbor that will step in when needed.
We knew it would be close and wanted to have [the backup office] ready, said Chris Noles, another meteorologist in the Paducah office. For what we needed, it was like flipping a switch. But we had them on standby and just said keep the line open. Dont hang up. Finally, we made the call.
Moments later, the EF-2 tornado missed the office by less than two miles. It was confirmed later that day as a significant tornado with 125 mph winds, on the ground for more than 16 miles.
As the danger peaked, a meteorologist at the office took to Twitter to warn residents downwind: 9:31 AM TORNADO JUST MISSED OUR OFFICE IN WEST PADUCAH. TAKE SHELTER NOW IF YOU'RE IN PADUCAH!!!!
9:31 AM TORNADO JUST MISSED OUR OFFICE IN WEST PADUCAH. TAKE SHELTER NOW IF YOU'RE IN PADUCAH!!!!
— NWS Paducah (@NWSPaducah) March 14, 2019
Cloud bases were high enough that it looked pretty close, Noles said. Weve also had two other near-misses one in 2004 and another in 2013.
The Paducah office resumed normal operations minutes later. But thats not always the case.
The National Weather Service in Omaha two miles from the surging Platte River was forced to abandon its building Friday and evacuate. People in that office had waited as long as possible, but at 10:06 a.m. announced solemnly, The Omaha/Valley, NE NWS is evacuating due to flooding,"" citing the protection of lives and equipment as priority. It ominously stated, This will be the last message until the flooding threat is over.
Ultimately, its the meteorologist in charge that starts to feel staff is in certain jeopardy in situations like this, said Jaclyn Ritzman, emergency response specialist at the NWS Central Region headquarters. There was a levee nearby that was failing and causing water to rise quickly. Roads were closing and the water was coming up rapidly, so they made the call.
But unlike in Paducah, this was no flip of a switch. In fact, the office is still abandoned. Ritzman reported that no water had entered the building Friday, but a photo taken Sunday morning by the Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District shows that the office is probably taking on water.

Evacuating meant powering down weather radar and sensitive equipment, and the radar remains offline.
In the meantime, Omaha staff have relocated to the office in Hastings, Neb., about 160 miles away. There, they continue round-the-clock monitoring and forecasting of a potentially unprecedented series of floods in the Cornhusker State.
In 2017, floodwaters threatened the Weather Service office in Houston during Harvey. Meteorologists at the Key West, Fla., office rode out then-Category 4 Irma in their office, which had been built with the strength of a bunker. Weeks later, the office in Puerto Rico had its radar dome obliterated by 150 mph wind gusts in the eyewall of Hurricane Maria.
In 1973, a Weather Service office in Centreville, Ala., was sideswiped by an F-4 tornado, also destroying the radar dome. Staff reportedly worked there for weeks in the stifling summer heat without air conditioning while the building awaited repairs.
This time around, theres no telling when the Omaha office will be back up and running. Until floodwaters recede, its impossible to know the state of the building or the infrastructure inside.
The recipe was there for widespread flooding, said David Pearson, the service hydrologist at Hastings. We had a lot of frozen ground, then rain, and then melting. And it all went into the rivers.
When asked how this stacked up against other episodes of flooding, Pearsons answer was blunt. Nothing compares to this.","Twice last week, local Weather Service offices were forced to go offline to escape Mother Nature’s fury.",2019-03-18T16:17:14Z,‘It was a little surreal’: Forecasters flee as a tornado and flood target National Weather Service offices,The Washington Post,0

"When General Motors announced it was cutting up to 14,000 jobs and idling five automotive plants, it justified the massive cuts by citing long-term savings. The cuts would free up $6 billion in cash, for a net savings of $4.5 billion in cash by 2020. The move will ""make General Motors more agile, resilient and profitable"" while the economy's still revving, CEO Mary Barra told investors Monday. Wall Street seemed to believe her, with GM's stock rising nearly 5 percent and one analyst on the call congratulating her ""on getting in front of the curve here."" But GM hasn't exactly been tightfisted in recent years. The company has spent $10.6 billion since 2015 buying back its own shares, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock buybacks do nothing for a company's productive capacity. But because buybacks reduce the number of shares on the market and thus make a stock more valuable, they can be popular with many investors as well as senior executives who are paid largely in stock. GM is far from the only company to spend money goosing its stock price. This year alone, corporations have announced some $955.6 billion in buybacks, according to TrimTabs Investment Research, and the figure for the whole year could exceed $1 trillion. But GM started its stock repurchasing program back in 2015, less than six years after a bankruptcy process that cost U.S. taxpayers $11 billion. (The United Auto Workers and a number of politicians have pointed to the bailout in a vow to fight GM's planned cuts, though it's unclear politicians can do anything to change them.) The company announced $5 billion of buybacks in March 2015, then added another $4 billion later that year. In 2017, it re-upped and announced a further $5 billion in buybacks, $1.6 billion of which have so far taken place. GM's stock price dipped 2 percent over that time period. ""[T]hat money could have been used in different ways, including investment in older plants. But would that be a good way to use the earnings? Mary Barra thought not,"" said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""She decided that the money should be taken out of the company and returned to shareholders. It's really quite a statement about where she thinks the traditional auto sector in the U.S. is headed."" Where it's headed seems to be an SUV-only road, as GM will stop producing sedans after next year. The company's inability to create a profitable small car that can compete with imports represents another missed opportunity, according to William Lazonick, professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. ""If it was simply that 'There's global competition and we can't make cars in the U.S.,' okay."" Lazonick said. ""But given the extent to which money's been pouring out on things that are useless, including supporting the stock price, I don't think you can make that argument."" He cited the 2015 buybacks as ""particularly egregious"" because they happened when the economy was weaker and GM was returning to steady profitability. ""They could have put that into the people who build their cars,"" he said. A company spokesperson did not address the buyback question, but said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that GM was ""building on the comprehensive strategy laid out in 2015"" and that it would ""appropriately reinvest in the business, maintain our strong investment grade balance sheet, and return all available free cash flow to our shareholders."" Where else could GM have gotten $4.5 billion? It could have dipped into $6.5 billion in overseas profits, suggested the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group. Although the GOP tax law last year made such repatriation easier, Fortune 500 corporations have overwhelmingly opted since its passage to buy back their stock instead of repatriating their cash, according to public data. ""This trend flies in the face of the Trump administration's promise that the corporate tax provisions -- especially a tax holiday for profits stashed offshore, of which GM appears to have had as much as $6.5 billion -- would spur a flood of new domestic investment,"" ITEP said. -- Rachel Layne contributed to this report.","Automaker to save $4.5 billion through massive job cuts, but it's spent far more than that trying to boost stock price",2018-11-27T22:43:34Z,"GM spent $10B on stock buybacks, then cut jobs to save $4.5B",CBS News,0
"LONDON (Reuters) - The flow of fresh funds to emerging markets should recover this year and next after a flood of money over the past decade, fueled by loose monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Institute of International Finance said on Friday. 
The IIF predicted non-resident capital flows of $1.26 billion in 2019, up from $1.14 billion in 2018, and another modest recovery next year. 
“Global growth is looking more positive, but the world is a more difficult place for emerging markets that depend on foreign capital inflows,” the report said. 
Quantitative easing by G3 nations in recent years helped funnel funds to emerging markets, in search of yield. That led to a “positioning overhang”, with investors overloaded on emerging-market assets, the IIF said. 
Flows to China accounted for much of the recovery in the first quarter, it said. Excluding China from previous quarters showed successive recoveries were weaker. 
“Despite a positive growth backdrop, capital flows to non-China emerging markets will recover modestly in 2019 and 2020, while remaining short of the levels observed in 2017,” the report said. 
Total net capital flows to China are projected to reach $50 billion in 2019 and $110 billion in 2020, the IIF said. 
Non-resident capital inflows to Turkey should start to increase in the second half of 2019, assuming credible structural reforms helped to improve sentiment. But net inflows of non-resident capital are likely to moderate further in 2019, in step with the projected fall in output, the IIF said. 
Turkey’s lira has come under renewed pressure in recent weeks, after shedding nearly 30 percent against the dollar last year. That led to local banks halting lending to their overseas counterparts last week, a move that spooked foreign investors.","The flow of fresh funds to emerging markets should recover this year and next after a flood of money over the past decade, fuelled by loose monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Institute of International Finance said on Friday.",2019-04-05T12:08:51Z,"Flows to emerging markets should recover in 2019, 2020, IIF says",Reuters,0

LONDON Anti-Brexit protesters flooded into central London by the hundreds of thousands on Saturday, demanding that Britain's Conservative-led government hold a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union.
The ""People's Vote March"" snaked from Park Lane and other locations to converge on the U.K. Parliament, where the fate of Brexit will be decided in the coming weeks.
Marchers carried European Union flags and signs praising the longstanding ties between Britain and continental Europe. The protest drew people from across Britain who are determined to force Prime Minister Theresa May's government to alter its march toward Brexit.
EU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the ""People's Vote"" march in central London on Saturday.Henry Nicholls / Reuters
Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, invited to help lead the march, called the crowd impressive and unified.
""There is a huge turnout of people here from all walks of life, of all ages and from all over the country,"" he tweeted. ""We are a Remain country now with 60 percent wanting to stop the Brexit mess.""
Police did not provide a crowd estimate. Independent legislator Chuka Umunna and others supporting a second Brexit referendum estimated the crowd at 1 million.
More than 4 million people endorsed an electronic petition this week in favor of revoking Article 50, the act that formally triggered the Brexit process.
The march comes as May, who opposes a second referendum on Britain's EU membership, is easing away from plans to hold a third vote on her troubled Brexit withdrawal plan, which has been strongly rejected twice by Parliament.
In a letter to lawmakers on Friday night, May said she might not seek passage of her Brexit withdrawal plan in Parliament next week. The embattled leader said she would only bring her EU divorce plan back to Parliament if there seems to be enough backing for it to pass.
""If it appears that there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before 12 April, but that will involve holding European Parliament elections,"" she said.
May's changing stance reflects the plan's dismal chances in the House of Commons after two prior defeats.
She also says she would need the approval of House Speaker John Bercow to bring the plan back for a third time. Bercow has said a third vote would violate parliamentary rules against repeatedly voting on the same thing unless May's Brexit divorce plan is altered.
Almost three years after Britons voted to walk away from the EU, the bloc's leaders this week seized control of the Brexit timetable from May to avert a chaotic departure on March 29 that would be disruptive for the world's biggest trading bloc and deeply damaging for Britain.
EU leaders at a summit in Brussels set two deadlines for Britain to leave the bloc of nearly half a billion people or to take an entirely new path in considering its EU future.
They agreed to extend the Brexit date until May 22, on the eve of the EU Parliament elections, if May can persuade the British Parliament to endorse her Brexit divorce deal.
Failing that, they gave May until April 12 to choose between leaving the bloc without a divorce deal or deciding on a radically new path, such as revoking Britain's decision to leave, holding a new referendum on Brexit or finding a cross-party consensus for a very different kind of Brexit.
Despite May's letter to lawmakers, it was not clear what path her minority government would take this week.
The anti-Brexit marchers on Saturday included 63-year-old Edmund Sides, who spent the last three weeks walking from Wales to London in order to take part.
Sides, a geologist, said he wanted to be able to speak to people along the way, encouraging families that have been split between Leave and Remain to mend their fences and talk.
""The whole country isn't doing enough of that,"" he said.
He is worried about the vicious tone that Brexit arguments have started to take and worries about national cohesion.

"* Report Japan to have new currency notes lifts some shares 
* Defensive stocks underperform 
By Ayai Tomisawa 
TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei edged lower on Tuesday morning as investors awaited full-year earnings reports, while Sony jumped after Reuters reported that U.S. hedge fund Third Point was again building a stake in the company to push for changes. 
The Nikkei share average was down 0.2 percent to 21,722.19 at the midday break. 
The Nikkei hit a four-month high on Monday but the market has stalled as investors wanted more clarity on the state of U.S.-China trade talks and remained cautious ahead a flood of corporate earnings. “The Nikkei has risen to a level where it needs more positive catalysts from companies’ earnings,” said Shogo Maekawa, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Companies need to show growth stories to convince investors that the Japanese market deserves further gains,” 
On Thursday, Yaskawa Electric will start this month’s parade of earning reports for the year ended March 31. The automation equipment maker, whose shares gained 0.6 percent on Tuesday morning, is closely followed because it has large exposure to China. 
The broader Topix shed 0.6 percent to 1,611.23, with all but six subsectors in negative territory. Defensive sectors such as utilities, real estate and construction underperformed. 
Tokyo Electric Power Co tumbled 2.7 percent, Mitsui Fudosan declined 1.6 percent and Kajima Corp d 1.4 percent. 
Sony Corp shares surged more than 7 percent in early trade after sources told Reuters that Third Point, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle to target between $500 million and $1 billion to buy more Sony shares. 
Chip equipment stocks also advanced after the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index rose overnight. Tokyo Electron advanced 0.7 percent and Advantest Corp gained 1.7 percent.

"(Repeats item initially transmitted on Friday, March 29) 
By Sinéad Carew 
NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Wall Street will be watching next week’s economic data with a laser focus after a dismal February jobs report and recessionary warning signals from U.S. Treasury yields. 
After the longest U.S. government shutdown on record, bad weather and a late 2018 equities sell-off muddied market participants’ view on the U.S. economy in recent months, they are hoping for a clearer view from upcoming data. 
Investors have been anxious for reassurance since U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields last Friday fell below three-month Treasury bill yields for the first time since 2007. 
The S&amp;P fell almost 2 percent that day as yield curve inversions are widely viewed as recessionary indicators and this one occurred two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled back on expected rate hikes amid signs of slowing economic growth. 
“Investors are going to be hyper-sensitive to data,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. “The yield curve inversion is the manifestation of investors’ fears that the U.S. is getting caught up in a global slowdown.” 
Many investors say they do not expect a U.S. recession any time soon. But they are seeking confirmation for this optimism in next week’s data, which includes retail sales, manufacturing activity, durable goods orders and non-farm payrolls. 
Reports that meet or beat expectations “would suggest the soft patch we entered the year with is temporary” and would confirm economic projections for 2019, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. 
February’s U.S. retail sales data, due on Monday, and the March jobs report, scheduled for Friday, may be the most closely watched indicators as economists want reassurance on the spending power and confidence of U.S. consumers, which represent about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. 
U.S. non-farm payroll growth almost stalled in February, with only 20,000 jobs created. Economists polled by Reuters last expected an average of 170,000 new jobs for March. 
January retail sales rose a modest 0.2 percent after a December decline, but were not seen as strong enough to alter slowing U.S. economic momentum. Economists, on average, expect a February increase of 0.3 percent. 
“If we were to witness a faltering of the U.S consumer, that would be very difficult for markets, which are relying on the U.S. consumer to propel the cycle through at least another year,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife in Toronto. 
But Donald expects a rebound in both retail sales and jobs, since the last reports were weakened by the December-January government shutdown. She will also watch durable goods data, due on Tuesday, for a view on corporate capital spending. 
“I have less conviction capex will take off markedly, but if we do see an improvement, that would be a substantial surprise,” said Donald. 
Strong capex would also surprise TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan, who says companies have stalled spending as they await the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks. 
Kinahan says U.S.-China tensions could mute market reactions to data “unless it’s so far off to the upside or the downside.” The two countries are due to negotiate in Washington, D.C., next week after what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said were “constructive” talks in Beijing this week. 
Options contracts on the S&amp;P 500 Index and its tracking fund, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, show a modest uptick in the volatility priced into contracts expiring next Friday, compared with other near-term expirations. 
“We should expect more volatile days,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Probably the job numbers will be the biggest focus, partly because of February’s miss and partly due to the overall concerns about slower growth.” 
Manufacturing data will also be under close scrutiny on Monday after weak U.S. and German March data last Friday, according to Cresset’s Ablin. 
While Ameriprise’s Price is expecting solid data, he cautions: “The market has more downside risk than upside risk primarily because of the yield inversion, the concern over the tone of economic data over the past few months, not just in the United States, but around the world.”

"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act gave taxpayers lower tax rates on more of their income, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and provided higher tax credits for families with children. But while the new tax law gave breaks to many, it also took away from others.
To pay for the tax breaks, the tax law erased many deductions that millions of taxpayers claim every year. These popular deductions will no longer be allowed starting in the 2018 tax year, whose filing season starts Jan. 28, 2019. The deductions will remain out of action through 2025, unless Congress acts to make the tax law permanent.
Personal Exemptions
Last year, everyone could claim this deduction, which was $4,050 for yourself and each family member listed on your tax return. So, if you are single, you could claim one exemption, and if married with two children, you would have claimed four personal exemptions.
Lawmakers say that the doubling of the standard deduction effectively replaced this exemption – but that's not exactly true. 
Take an individual filing in 2017. She could have taken her standard deduction of $6,350 and a personal deduction of $4,050, totaling $10,400.
Under the new tax law, her personal deduction is zero in 2018 and her standard deduction is $12,000. In this example, the single taxpayer has a larger deduction in 2018.
Families are in a different situation. In 2017, a family of four would have enjoyed a personal exemption of $16,200 ($4,050 x 4) and a standard deduction of $12,700, totaling a combined deduction of $28,900. 
But in 2018, they can no longer claim the personal deduction, and their standard deduction is $24,000, or lower than the deduction they enjoyed in 2017.
But families may still make come out ahead, given that some taxpayers lost deductions if their income exceeded certain thresholds. Starting in 2018, the phase-out for the personal exemption and standard deduction for married couples with adjusted gross income above $313,800 (and singles above $261,500) has been repealed. Also, families will receive higher child tax credits in 2018, so those tax credits may offset the impact of the loss of personal exemptions for families.  
Home equity loan interest
The new tax law generally limits the deductibility of mortgage interest on up to $750,000 of debt used to acquire a home. The new rules also disallow deducting the interest on home equity loans used in many common transactions. 
For example, if you take out a home equity loan on your home and used the proceeds for other purposes, such as college tuition or to pay off credit card debt, then you can't treat the interest on that home equity loan as deductible qualified residence interest. If instead you took out a home equity loan and used the proceeds to improve your existing home, then the interest would be deductible -- but only if the loan, when combined with your current mortgage, does not exceed the $750,000 total loan limits under the new rules. 
Many homeowners with existing mortgages and home equity loans will be unaffected because the prior-law-rules are still in place for them.
Moving expenses
If you met specific IRS criteria, and you have expenses relating to a move due to a change in your job or business location, your moving expenses would have been deductible in 2017. In 2015, the last year where data is available, approximately 1.1 million taxpayers claimed this deduction, which saved them about $3.7 billion. 
The tax law that starts in the 2018 tax year eliminates this deduction, which in the past could be claimed even if you didn't itemize your other deductions. Some folks are exempt from this change, such as members of the military on active duty.
Job expenses 
The deductions you've claimed for costs for things related to your job – such as license fees, required medical tests, clothing, tools and equipment and unreimbursed continuing education – are no longer allowed. The deduction for these costs was only allowed to the extent that these costs, when combined with your other miscellaneous deductions exceeded 2 percent of your AGI. 
Because your employer can still deduct these costs, consider asking them to help towards these expenses.
Tax preparation fees
Like job expenses, the costs you've paid to your tax preparer, when combined with other miscellaneous deductions were deductible to the extent the total exceeded two percent of your AGI. This deduction is no longer allowed. 
Other miscellaneous deductions
The list of other deductions – which includes investment advisory fees, investment related fees, credit card convenience fees, IRA account fees, etc.  – all which were subject to the two percent AGI limit, are no longer allowed.   
Parking and transit reimbursements 
In the 2017 tax year, workers could receive up to $255 per month from their employer towards parking and transit costs, and employers could deduct these reimbursements, which were also tax-free to the employee. Now employers can no longer deduct these reimbursements, so more employers are looking to eliminate these reimbursements to their employees.    
Casualty and theft losses
It used to be that if you incurred uninsured losses of property due to fires, flood, earthquake or other disasters that were greater than 10 percent of your AGI, the loss could be claimed as a deduction after subtracting $100 for each casualty loss of personal property. Under the new law, this deduction is only allowed for property damaged in areas which are under a presidential declaration as a disaster area.  
Donations to colleges to receive tickets to athletic events 
If you donated to a college and received tickets to an athletic event, you are now required to reduce the amount of your charitable donation deduction by the value of any tickets you receive to attend an athletic event.

"Hanoi, Vietnam — President Donald Trump's message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been simple and clear: Give up your nuclear weapons and a flood of wealth will soon be yours for the taking.
But here's a nagging question — Is that really what Kim wants?
With Trump and Kim descending on Hanoi for their second summit, there has been a persistent suggestion that Kim will look around at the relative prosperity of his Vietnamese hosts and think that he, too, should open up his country to more foreign investment and trade.
Trump himself has been the primary cheerleader.
On Wednesday morning he tweeted: ""Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong-Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!""
Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2019
For sure, North Korea could have a brighter future.
Potentially prosperous
""Using the words 'great economic power' is a Trumpian exaggeration, but a useful one,"" said William Brown, a North Korea economy expert and former CIA analyst. ""The truth is North Korea quite easily could become a prosperous country, growing faster than any of its neighbors and catching up with them in terms of income per capita. It has what it takes.""
Brown cited North Korea's strong human capital, low wages, and high levels of verbal and math literacy. He also noted it has a potential bonanza of natural resources such as lead, zinc, rare earths, coal, iron ore and hydropower. He said North Korea sits ""between four big economies that are far richer but increasingly moribund.""
Kim has also primarily focused on the development of infrastructure projects, building up the tourism industry and strengthening government regulation of the country's expanding market-style economy. 
But opening his country up to foreign capital and bringing his country in line with international financial standards means giving up a great deal of control.
Control, for Kim, is the most important commodity of all.
What does Kim Jong Un want in exchange for denuclearization?
Nuclear weapons helped the North Korean leader meet directly with a U.S. president, so Kim would be foolish to throw that away without significant reward. On the other hand, if he goes down a capitalist path, like South Korea, Kim could risk undermining his regime's own legitimacy.
As Kim arrived in Hanoi, back in Pyongyang the ruling party's daily newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, printed a commentary vowing the nation will stay the course the Kim family has set for the past three generations.
""The revolutionary cause of juche (self-reliance) and the cause of socialism are sure to triumph"" under the guidance of the party and the people ""who remain faithful to the cause of the party with indomitable mental power,"" it said.
Collaborating with South Korea 
In the immediate future, Kim wants to get in front of the growing market forces around him and undercutting support for trade sanctions that are limiting his options and drying up government coffers. North Korea is also hurting badly from its inability to export its minerals and coal.
Under Kim, enterprises have received unprecedented freedom to plan their own production and dispose of a large share of their profits themselves.
His government is especially interested in moving ahead on projects with South Korea, including the re-opening of a tourist resort at Mount Kumgang and an industrial center near the city of Kaesong that were both built with massive funding from the South. 
Given the choice between social controls or economic reforms, Kim will choose control, suggested Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a fellow at the Henry L. Stimson Center and editor of North Korea Economy Watch. 
""Whatever might happen, they'll proceed cautiously,"" Silberstein said.","Ahead of meeting with Kim Jong-Un, President Trump touts denuclearization as a ""great opportunity"" for North Koreans",2019-02-27T15:53:57Z,"Trump says North Korea has ""awesome"" potential",CBS News,0

"The mayor, former mayor, police chief and former clerk of a West Virginia city have been charged with embezzlement after an investigation into financial mismanagement and the misuse of federal funds meant to rebuild the city after a massive flood.
Officials on Friday announced the charges against Richwood Mayor Chris Drennen, former Mayor Bob Henry Baber, police Chief Lloyd Allen Cogar and former clerk Abigail McClung.
It wasn't immediately clear whether those charged had attorneys. A city spokeswoman declined to comment.
State Auditor John B. McCuskey described his investigation as a whirlwind that began by looking at Baber's purchasing card spending and quickly blossomed into a citywide accounting of where the more than $3 million in federal flood recovery money went.
Standing in Richwood City Hall before a crowd of angry residents Friday, McCuskey said much is still unclear.
""What we know is where they didn't go,"" he said of the federal dollars. ""And anybody can walk down main street in Richwood and see where they didn't go.""
He said that only about $400,000 of the federal money went toward flood recovery, with the rest unaccounted for.
Charging documents paint an unflattering picture of financial mismanagement across the city.
Cogar, the police chief, made what appear to be personal transactions with a governmental purchasing card, including an expenditure of more than $2,000 at a tire shop he owns, according to a criminal complaint. McClung, the former clerk, wrongly issued herself a check for 208 hours of vacation time before she left her city job.
The auditor's report offered more damaging details.
The city didn't keep track of the federal money, diverted funds away from their intended use and shelled out almost a quarter of a million dollars for consultants to help the city with the grant, according to audit. It also says Drennen and others were allowed unfettered discretion to pay themselves, family and friends nearly $500,000 after the flood.
In June 2016, thunderstorms drenched the region with as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain. A river that runs alongside Richwood swelled over, leading to flooding of more than 5 feet (1.5 meters). At least 23 people died, more than 200 homes were damaged or destroyed and infrastructure throughout the city was wrecked, according to the auditor's report.
""While certain public officials touted the Richwood recovery as an example of what a small community can do if they pull together,"" the report reads, ""it may now find itself serving as an example of greed, dysfunction, and what not to do following a natural disaster.""","The mayor, former mayor, police chief and former clerk of a West Virginia city have been charged with embezzlement",2019-03-29T21:27:26Z,"W.Va. mayor, police chief charged with embezzlement",ABC News,0
"An unprecedented series of drenching rain storms, culminating in this weekends soaking, has catapulted 2018 to the wettest year on record in Washington. This years rainfall tally shoves aside the previous top mark which stood for nearly 130 years. The steady rain Friday night into Saturday morning elevated 2018s total past the previous record of 61.33 inches set in 1889. The National Weather Service announced the record was surpassed at 6:26 a.m. Saturday. An additional inch or so of rain could fall through Sunday, pushing 2018 further ahead of historically wet years of the past. Weather records in Washington date back to 1871. Washington joins Baltimore, which broke its annual rainfall record in November, in notching its wettest year. Dozens of other locations in the Mid-Atlantic, including Wilmington, N.C., Charleston, W. Va, and State College, Pa., have also set yearly rainfall records with two weeks still remaining. The extreme rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic has stemmed from a weather pattern unleashing a parade of storms through the region since May. Except for brief pauses in the first half of July and this month, it has seldom relented. The jet stream, which is the high-altitude air current along which storms track, has persistently directed moisture-packed storms through the region. The pattern gave rise to the devastating flood in Ellicott City, Md. in late May, its second 1 in 1,000 year deluge in two years. Frederick, Md. also endured a severe flood event in May when its downtown area was engulfed by half a foot of water in two hours. Around this time, Washington witnessed a stretch of seven days in a row with at least 0.25 inches of rain, its longest such streak ever recorded. In all, Washington has seen 122 days with measurable rain this year, which isnt out of the ordinary considering the long-term average is 116. But very often when its rained, its poured. At least an inch of rain has accumulated on a record 22 days. The frequent episodes of heavy rain have spurred multiple flood events on area waterways. As the torrents poured into the Potomac River, waters rose to flood stage three times at the gauge at Little Falls, once in June and twice in September. In each of the three instances, the water level ranked among the top 75 crests in records that date to the 1930s. The 61-plus inches of rain so far this year is 50 percent above the long-term average of around 40 inches. For perspective, other cities whose average yearly rainfall is between 60 and 65 inches include Miami (62 inches) and New Orleans (64 inches). Although scientists hesitate from attributing the rainfall in a single year to climate change, an increase in heavy precipitation is an expectation as the planet warms. Washingtons temperatures have risen over time and 2018 is on track to rank among the top 10 warmest years on record. The federal governments National Climate Assessment, published in November, documented a recent trend toward increasing rainfall intensity in the northeast U.S. and, due to climate warming, projects even heavier downpours in the coming decades. [ The weather of Washingtons future: Hellish heat and high water, says Trump administration climate report ] The record-setting rainy year by the numbers Four: The total rainfall in four months ranked among the top 10 highest on record. Seven: The number of calendar days which saw record rainfall.

"(Reuters) - Two days after authorities in Northern California ended their search for human remains from the deadliest wildfire in state history, the number of people listed as missing was reduced on Friday to fewer than 50, down from the nearly 200 last tallied. The confirmed death toll from the Camp Fire stood unchanged from the past few days at 88, but the newly revised roster of people still unaccounted for came as welcome news three weeks after flames ravaged the Sierra foothills town of Paradise. At a news conference on Wednesday night, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said search and recovery teams had finished combing through the ruins of approximately 18,000 homes and other buildings incinerated by the blaze. The missing-persons list then consisted of 196 names, though Honea said he was hopeful that many individuals would eventually turn up alive as they realized that loved ones were looking for them. By Friday night, the whereabouts of most had, indeed, been determined, and the list was winnowed down again to just 49 names, the sheriff’s office said. That total was by far the smallest to date, greatly diminishing the number of people who might potentially be declared missing and presumed dead. Honea has acknowledged the possibility that some who perished in the blaze might never be found, but he also has refused to speculate on how many such cases might exist. The number of missing has fluctuated widely since the fire erupted on Nov. 8, briefly exceeding 1,200 names about two weeks ago. With the fire now reduced to embers, the National Weather Service issued flash-flood warnings on Thursday and Friday for the burn zone as showers and thunderstorms heightened the risk of heavy runoff in areas stripped of vegetation by the fire. The bulk of the devastation occurred in and around the hamlet of Paradise, a town once home to almost 27,000 people, many of them retirees, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. The current death toll already ranks as the greatest loss of life on record from a California wildfire and the most from a wildfire anywhere in the United States, dating back to Minnesota’s 1918 Cloquet Fire, which killed as many as 1,000 people. Authorities attribute the Camp Fire’s high casualty count in large part to the tremendous speed with which flames raced through Paradise with little warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees. Remains of many victims were found in the ashen rubble of homes, others inside or near the burned-out wreckage of vehicles. The cause of the blaze remained under investigation. But electric utility PG&amp;E Corp ( PCG.N ) reported equipment problems near the origin of the fire around the time it began.

"Just hours after a former Democratic candidate in Nevada accused former Vice President Joe Biden of inappropriate sexual conduct during a 2014 campaign event, the 76-year-old prospective 2020 presidential candidate issued a statement Sunday strongly denying wrongdoing -- but promising to ""listen respectfully"" to any accusations of misconduct.
Nevada lieutenant governor candidate Lucy Flores alleged in an article Friday that Biden ""plant[ed] a big slow kiss on the back of my head."" In a statement shortly afterward, a Biden spokesperson denied that the vice president or his staff had been aware that Flores was uncomfortable.
""In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort,"" Biden said in his own statement Sunday. ""And not once -- never -- did I believe I acted inappropriately.  If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.""
Biden added: ""I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.
WHY ARE CNN, MSNBC IGNORING MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BIDEN?
""I will also remain the strongest advocate I can be for the rights of women,"" he continued. ""I will fight to build on the work I’ve done in my career to end violence against women and ensure women are treated with the equality they deserve. I will continue to surround myself with trusted women advisers who challenge me to see different perspectives than my own. And I will continue to speak out on these vitally important issues where there is much more progress to be made and crucial fights that must be waged and won.”
But the episode has led to a flood of pictures showing Biden with various women at campaign events and other administration functions surfacing on social media.
A Vox.com piece published on Friday titled, ""Lucy Flores isn’t alone. Joe Biden’s got a long history of touching women inappropriately"" catalogued several alleged episodes of misconduct by the former vice president, and asserted that ""the media gave Biden a pass for years. It won’t in 2020.""
""Biden’s been caught on camera embracing a female reporter from behind and gripping her above her waist, just below her bust,"" Laura McGann wrote in the article. ""At a swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Ash Carter, Biden put his hands on the shoulders of Stephanie Carter, Carter’s wife, and then leaned in and whispered into her ear. (He’s whispered into many women’s ears.) He’s also touched women’s faces and necks during other photo-ops. Once at a swearing-in ceremony for a US senator, he held the upper arm of the senator’s preteen daughter, leaned down and whispered into her ear, as she became visibly uncomfortable. Then he kissed the side of her forehead, a gesture that made the girl flinch.""

Speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told host Chris Wallace: ""First of all, this woman Lucy is very bold to come forward, and I would remind the audience that she shares Joe Biden’s political party. He was there to help to Democratic Party of Nevada, and her candidacy, so it’s quite bold for her to go up against the highest levels of her own political party.""
Conway continued: If anybody just types in ‘Creepy Uncle Joe Videos,’ you come up with a treasure trove of far more evidentiary information and videos than we saw when Brett Kavanaugh's nomination was trying to be derailed ... and his family being destroyed by folks who had no evidence of what had allegedly happened 34 years earlier. I think Joe Biden has a big problem here, because he calls it affection and handshakes -- his party calls it completely inappropriate.""
Meanwhile, several other Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls -- including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand -- are also defending their self-professed commitment to the ideals of the #MeToo movement against a series of accusations they recently mismanaged sexual-misconduct claims against their subordinates.
As the three prominent senators each have sought to draw a sharp contrast with President Trump, who has faced his own misconduct allegations, the claims highlighted vulnerabilities that could become major liabilities not only in a heated Democrat Party primary, but also in the general election.

"(CNN) ""Silent Night"" might be one of the sweetest Christmas carols there is, but following the trail of the man who wrote it exactly 200 years ago involves an unexpectedly macabre twist. ""The skull is embedded behind there,"" says guide Sepp Greimel, pointing at a nativity scene over the altar of the chapel we're stood in. The skull, mercifully not visible, belongs to Josef Mohr, Catholic priest and joint composer of the Christmas carol that has been translated from its original ""Stille Nacht"" into more languages than there are countries in the United Nations. Its final resting place, the small Austrian town of Oberndorf bei Salzburg, is aptly named for his most famous verse: the Silent Night chapel. In midwinter, a visit here is a truly festive experience. Despite its rural Austrian chocolate-box style exterior, the church's interior is rather bare: a larch ceiling, fir pews to sit 22 and a pink-red marble floor hewn from a nearby quarry. The only decorations are the two small stained glass windows with images of Mohr, who wrote the lyrics, and Franz Xaver Gruber who composed the music to ""Silent Night."" Two plain portraits of the men adorn the wall. There's also a framed copy of their famous song -- just six stanzas, but apparently three too many when sung in its original language. ""We only sing stanzas one, two and six,"" Greimel says. ""Stanzas three, four and five are difficult to sing in German."" The chapel -- simple, like the song -- was built to replace the parish church of St Nicholas where Mohr served as a curate and where the song was first performed 200 years ago, on Christmas Eve, 1818. To explain why the original church was demolished, Greimel leads the way outside. Snowflakes are falling mutely on the old center of Oberndorf, which is already covered in a dusting of snow. The scene is so Christmassy it wouldn't be a surprise to see Santa Claus descending from the heavens in a sleigh. From the top of a nearby levee, the river Salzbach can be seen making a large U-bend only a few hundred yards from the chapel. Beyond it, the picturesque town of Laufen lies over the border in Germany. Oberndorf, along with Laufen, once belonged to the Bishop of Salzburg for centuries until the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century. Subsequent frontier changes divided them between Austria and Germany. They had both prospered from the river trade in salt, especially since a large boulder in the bend, known as Nocken, forced barges to stop here, unload and reload. The Salzbach was the blessing of the two towns, but also, thanks to frequent floods, their curse -- hence the levee. ""There was a terrible flood here in 1899,"" Greimel says, his voice trembling as if he'd experienced it himself. ""It destroyed the old Oberndorf center. ""The villagers then decided to build a new church 600 yards to the south, on higher ground."" It was an earlier flood that was responsible for ""Silent Night."" For the full story, it's time to go back to the beginning. Mohr was born out of wedlock in 1792 in the nearby city of Salzburg, the son of a seamstress and an army musketeer, according to local history expert Michaela Muhr. One of his first homes still stands at number 31 Steingasse, a plain terraced house on two floors in the poorest part of town. Steingasse is a cobblestoned street, one carriage's width, with buildings rising high either side, permanently in shade, except when the sun stands directly above at noon. ""Because he was illegitimate, it was difficult to find godparents to baptize him,"" says Muhr. ""Only the town hangman agreed. He was keen to make up for his executions, but even he sent his housekeeper instead."" Baptized in the same font as Mozart, Mohr later began to grow into a child of sufficient intelligence to receive mentoring from the cathedral curate, who supervised his education and brought him to the cloth. The Oberndorf museum at the old parsonage opposite the Silent Night chapel picks up the story with its exhibits focusing on that Christmas Eve, 1818. The church organist at the time was Franz Xaver Gruber, a schoolteacher only five years older than Mohr, who worked in the village of Arnsdorf three miles north. As floodwaters from the Salzbach had been regularly inundating Oberndorf -- including the church of St Nicholas -- water damage had left the organ in need of a visit from the tuner. To provide alternative music, Mohr picked up a poem he'd written and asked Gruber to put it to music for guitar and two voices. Gruber knocked it out in an afternoon. That evening Mohr sang tenor and played guitar, Gruber sang bass and the congregation sang the chorus of ""Silent Night."" Because guitar was not an ""approved"" church instrument, they had to perform the song after Mass. Silent Night with its mournful melody and message of hope struck a chord among the destitute community of barge workers, coming as it did after the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars and the distressing split with the neighboring town of Laufen. The salt trade was in decline, anyway -- even Nocken, the giant boulder, had been dynamited by the Salzburg authorities, removing the natural river halt. ""Don't marry a bargeman,"" ran the local saying. ""In the summer you don't have a husband and in the winter you don't have any food."" But how did an obscure village carol conquer the world? Enter Karl Mauracher, the organ tuner. He finally arrived in the New Year, heard the song and returned with the sheet music to his home town of Fügen in Tyrol. The Tyrolese had a long tradition of choirs who made money during the barren winter months by touring German towns, not unlike the von Trapp family in ""The Sound of Music."" Two local groups, the Strasser and the Rainer family singers, heard ""Silent Night"" and included it in their repertoire. Before long it became widely known in Germany, then Europe and, in 1839 -- as the Rainer family crossed the Atlantic -- the United States. In 1854 the Prussian Court's Hofkapelle (chapel musical ensemble) wrote a letter to Salzburg asking who composed the song. Gruber answered the letter, explaining that he wrote the melody and Mohr, by then deceased, the lyrics. By the 1920s, ""Silent Night"" was so well known that a chapel was built on the spot where St Nicholas church stood. Construction started in 1924 but was only consecrated in 1937, disrupted by -- what else -- frequent flooding. Although Gruber had a portrait painted during his rather successful lifetime, there was no image left of Mohr, who died young. To create a likeness, a sculptor, Josef Muehlbacher, had Mohr's skull exhumed from his grave in the village of Wagrein, the priest's last posting. All the portraits we have of him, including those in the Silent Night chapel, are Muehlbacher's imagined impressions. For whatever reasons, the skull never found its way back to Wagrein, and is interred behind the nativity scene in the Silent Night chapel meaning, somewhat ironically, that his remains have not been left to sleep in heavenly peace. Salzburg can be reached in two hours by train from Vienna. Oberndorf can be reached by taxi (roughly $25) from Salzburg in 20 minutes.

"Washington (CNN)White House lawyers expect to have an opportunity to review whatever version of Robert Mueller's report Attorney General Bill Barr submits to Congress before it reaches lawmakers and the public, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, setting up a potential political battle over the hotly anticipated document.
The attorneys want the White House to have an opportunity to claim executive privilege over information drawn from documents and interviews with White House officials, the sources said. 
The White House's review of executive privilege claims are within its legal purview, but could set up a political battle over the perception President Donald Trump is trying to shield certain information from the public about an investigation that has swirled around him since the first day of his presidency.
Justice Department lawyers could advise him against certain assertions if they don't feel it's legally defensible. If Trump does assert executive privilege, the decision could be litigated in court if it's challenged, which Democrats would almost certainly do.
""There's always tension between what looks best politically and what represents the interests of the institution -- the office of the presidency,"" one source close to the White House said. ""Preserving executive privilege trumps political optics.""
While Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani suggested privilege could be used to keep parts of the report from public view, the issue is up to the White House, not the President's personal attorneys. 
The Justice Department and White House declined comment.
As the White House is bracing for Mueller's investigation to conclude, some officials describe a sense of anxiety at the contents of the report, even as they welcome the probe's end.
A person close to the President's legal team offered some caution in a sign of the level of anxiety about how closely held Mueller has kept his investigation.
""Let's get the airplane on the runway and see what we got,"" the source said.
But Trump, who spent part of this weekend lambasting Mueller on Twitter, does not plan to be blindsided by what the Justice Department possibly discloses to Congress and the public of the report. Instead, his lawyers expect the contents will be viewed first by them.
White Houses under Republican and Democratic presidents have asserted executive privilege to prevent certain information from being disclosed to Congress, and attorneys representing the White House and Trump have personally indicated they could assert that privilege over information that would be disclosed to Congress and the public. 
During his confirmation hearing last year, Barr said while he did not ""have a clue as to what would be in the report,"" he said ""someone might raise a claim of executive privilege"" if there is ""material to which an executive privilege claim could be made."" 
Barr has wide discretion under existing regulations to decide what to share or not share with lawmakers -- but the issue could ultimately be subject to extended legal battles.
Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike have repeatedly stressed the importance of transparency in the release of the conclusions of the two-year investigation stemming from Russian interference in the 2016 elections. 
Last Thursday, the House overwhelmingly approved a resolution urging the release of Mueller's report.
A source close to the President's legal team said the White House allowed interviews with White House officials with the understanding that claims of executive privilege could later be raised. The White House produced more than a million documents to the special counsel's office, but not all of that material would be subject to executive privilege, nor would documents from the campaign.
""The White House shouldn't advise the attorney general on what it should share and not share. That's up the attorney general and he's independent on this one,"" said Mark Tuohey, a former prosecutor who has been involved in past special counsel investigations. 
""The report by the special counsel, which could be the subject of a summary by the AG, focuses on potential conduct of the President of the United States and his aides and staff. That is not a matter to be discussed with the White House before the matter is sent to Congress,"" he said.
But Tuohey said it would be appropriate for the Justice Department to give the White House counsel's office the opportunity to weigh in on specific pieces of information that could be subject to executive privilege protections.
Mueller's confidential report to Barr is expected to happen any day now. 
The impending release of the report has led some aides to the President to conclude Mueller was dropping his demand for a sit-down interview with Trump, which would be a win for the White House and its legal team.
Indeed, many of Trump's aides view the conclusion of Mueller's tenure -- which has symbolically consumed all but a few months of the administration -- as a positive development that could allow the President and his team to move forward.
That appeared to be Trump's optimistic view on Monday when he tweeted his belief that the report would reveal itself to be a sham.
""Very few think it is legit! We will soon find out?"" he wrote.
Of course, the ramifications of Mueller's investigation are far from over, including the various ancillary probes that were launched as a result of what his team uncovered. The Southern District of New York is still pursuing investigations into matters linked to the President and Democratic lawmakers plan to pursue a series of investigations after Mueller's investigation concludes.
Most White House aides are siloed off from issues relating to Mueller and are preparing to move Trump's agenda beyond the border wall fight and North Korea summit that together consumed the first part of the year.
Whatever issues the administration pursues next, however, will play out against the backdrop of a brewing fight over disclosures from the Mueller report.
One White House aide said Trump's team is hitting the ""reset button"" after plowing through rancorous budget negotiations and North Korea talks.
Emmett Flood, the White House lawyer tasked with handling the White House's response to the Mueller probe, and officials have held meetings to game out the White House's response to whatever becomes public, a senior White House official said.
Officials have prepared the outlines of how the White House would react to different scenarios, based on the extent of Barr's disclosure to Congress and whether the findings are exculpatory or damaging to the President, the official said. Those efforts have largely been undertaken by Flood and his team, rather than by officials in the White House press shop, which has sought to keep its distance from the Mueller investigation.
While the White House has tried to avoid commenting on the probe, that could change once the Mueller report emerges, particularly if it is exculpatory, a senior White House official said. The White House has repeatedly directed reporters to the President's legal team on questions related to the investigation, but White House officials have mulled a response to the report from the President or White House press secretary Sarah Sanders depending on the outcome. 
The investigations by Democrats are picking up pace and the White House is grappling with how to be both perceived as compliant with the requests while handing over a minimum of potentially privileged documents, aides said.
""This White House will do everything legally in its power to work with the Democrats and the House to get them information that they need,"" a senior White House official said. ""But it has to be legal, it has to be right and it has to be fair.""
As White House officials discuss the official response to Mueller's conclusion, aides are also mindful their plans could go awry in moments with a tweet from Trump, who has repeatedly taken to Twitter to assail the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt.""","White House lawyers expect to have an opportunity to review whatever version of Robert Mueller's report Attorney General Bill Barr submits to Congress before it reaches lawmakers and the public, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, setting up a pot…",2019-03-18T23:03:56Z,White House expects to see Mueller findings before they go to Congress,CNN,0
"(CNN)The federal government is doing a worse job managing the problem of climate change under President Donald Trump, according to an investigation from the Government Accountability Office that included climate change on its High Risk List report on Wednesday.
This year's High Risk List is a 293-page assessment of the threats facing the federal government, including such matters as cybersecurity and problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The GAO has been putting the list together since 1990 and delivers it to Congress every two years to make legislators aware of the programs that it considers most vulnerable to mismanagement, fraud, waste or abuse and most in need of fixing.
Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, GAO Comptroller General Eugene Louis Dodaro said that of the many areas that need improvement, ""three areas have actually regressed,"" and limiting the federal government's fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks is one of them. 
Also in that category were the Environmental Protection Agency's process for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals and NASA acquisition management.
Because the government has revoked policies that had partially addressed climate change and has not taken steps recommended in previous reports, this high-risk area requires ""significant attention,"" the new report says.
The government had been making big strides in improving its leadership on climate change in the Obama administration, according to past reports, but it ""has not made measurable progress since 2017,"" the latest report says.
Climate change, in particular the severe storms it brings, has cost the American taxpayer nearly half a trillion dollars since 2015, the report says. ""The last several years have been some of the most costly in US history,"" Dodaro said. 
Mark Gaffigan, managing director of the GAO's natural resources and environment team, explained that there have been 241 billion-dollar events, an average of six a year, since 1980. In recent years, there have been many more: an average of about 15 a year. 
The government would be smart to spend money on the front-end to prepare for climate change, Dodaro said.
""For every dollar spent in hazard mitigation and resilience building saves $6 later,"" Dodaro said, citing research from the National Institute of Building Sciences. He said that if the United States were to adopt the most recent international building codes, which take climate change into account, it would save $11 for every dollar invested.
The Trump administration's response to flooding that will increase with climate change could also be a problem, he said. 
""I'm also concerned that the administration revoked the flood hazard mitigation standard [that] required buildings to be elevated [and] have a national standard in that area,"" Dodaro said. 
The federal flood insurance program is also on the High Risk List, he added. Even though Congress has forgiven $16 billion in debt to the Treasury, the program is still more than $20 billion in debt. 
The report says the Trump administration increased the government's risk by rescinding guidance directing agencies to consider climate change in their reviews of certain federal projects. 
Climate change also poses a serious threat to the country's 555,000 defense facilities, according to the report, especially those along the coasts. Asking what should be done about it, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, cited Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida, which was unable to move a number of F-22 Raptors ahead of Hurricane Michael in 2018. Damage to the planes and the base cost $3 billion.
""They need to have a plan to look ahead as they are building their infrastructure, modernizing their infrastructure, to building resistance, climate resistance policies and procedures,"" Dadaro said, adding that Camp Lejeune in North Carolina had more than $3 billion worth of damage from Hurricane Florence last year. 
The government should also create a national climate information system to help state, local and private-sector decision-making, the report said. Better climate change information could help local governments create better building codes, for example.
Weather satellite data is the one bright spot in the GAO's new report when it comes to climate change. 
The previous report singled out aging satellites as a real problem. But now, the GAO determined that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Defense followed its recommendations and created independent monitoring programs, and the departments showed that new satellites did not lead to data gaps.
The report probably would not come as a surprise to President Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed concerns about climate change.
In November, he dismissed a study produced by his own administration involving 13 federal agencies and more than 300 leading climate scientists, warning of the potentially catastrophic impact of climate change.
""I don't believe it,"" Trump said at the time, adding that he had read ""some"" of the report. Trump created a White House committee on climate change but put a climate change skeptic in charge. 
The administration has proposed an end to several programs that fight climate change that were not mentioned in the report. In December, the EPA proposed relaxing regulations for newly built coal-fired power plants, a proposal that its own risk analysis determined would result in 1,400 more premature deaths a year as of 2030.
Also in December, the United States sided with Russia and Saudi Arabia to contest language supporting a landmark climate report on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. 
The United States has reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the landmark climate agreement called the Paris Accord, and polluters have seen the lowest level of EPA fines under this administration.
There has been a call for rapid action on climate change on Capitol Hill. Congress has held dozens of hearings to hear from experts who continue to warn that the government needs to act before it's too late.
The climate change report released in November said that the nation's economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century and that it would kill thousands of people.
Humans are already living with the warmest temperatures in modern history. Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit.
Without preparation for changes like this, ""there is a lot of exposure that the federal government has,"" Dodaro said.","The federal government is doing a worse job managing the problem of climate change under President Donald Trump, according to an investigation from the Government Accountability Office that included climate change on its High Risk List report on Wednesday.",2019-03-07T00:45:19Z,"Climate change gets worse management under Trump, investigation finds",CNN,0
"Winter storms keep lashing California with various degrees of impact, and on the doorstep is another atmospheric river primed to drop torrents of rain on waterlogged ground.
For all the record-breaking precipitation, the flood damage to property and harm to people has been minimal (with localized exceptions such as Guerneville).
The big billion-dollar disaster has been avoided, said Marty Ralph, director of the Center for Western Water and Weather Extremes (CW3E) at the University of California at San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
The credit for flood prevention goes to the states systems of flood control and water retention, some of which were constructed more than a century ago.
 Also, theres been luck, seen in the randomness of meteorology, as no single metropolitan region has found itself consistently under a deluge. In February, measurable rain was recorded on 17 of 28 days in Sacramento and San Francisco, on 13 days in San Diego and 12 in Los Angeles. (Which also goes to show how much California there is to California: The coastline measures 840 miles longer than the straight-line distance between Washington, D.C., and St. Petersburg, Fla.)
This latest storm making landfall early Tuesday between Monterey and Los Angeles is the work of the 20th atmospheric river to strike Southern California during the 2018-19 water year, which began in October.
According to CW3E research, that number isnt out of line with a wet year. In 2016-17, there were 27 atmospheric rivers during a winter so laden with snow and rain it ended a drought that had lasted as long as a decade, according to some experts. During the winter of a dry year, Ralph said, the number averages about 12-15.
During the winter of 2017-18 there were only 11 such events, so few as to help restart the drought. But a year later, the grounds thirst is slaked and reservoirs are replenishing.
There have been so many atmospheric river-fed storms in Southern California that smaller events are escaping notice such as this past weekends spritzing of the region with an inch-plus of rainfall.
But this winter is notable, said Ralph, namesake of the new rating system for atmospheric rivers, for the number of such events categorized as 3s (strong) or greater. So far in 2018-19, there have been two such events. Since 2013-14, there have been three years with no strong atmospheric rivers.
Whats due to strike now isnt expected to pack an undue amount of moisture. But the duration and location of the storm could make this a soaker.
It still looks like the area of deepest moisture will stall for a 6-12-hour period somewhere Tuesday night, likely the western portion but not certain yet, the National Weather Service office serving the Los Angeles area said Monday.
Even a seemingly mild rain, given enough time parked over one spot, can wreak havoc. The area the Weather Service considers likely to be under a fire hose for up to half a day is the scorched mountainsides of the Thomas Fire, in western Ventura and eastern Santa Barbara counties.
Plus, the storm is expected to pack strong southerly winds that will gust headlong into Californias Transverse Ranges which run east-west, or perpendicular to the axis of the atmospheric riverss flow meaning orographic effects are in play.
Assuming all these factors come together, the Weather Service said, there is a reasonable chance that rain rates will reach or exceed burn area debris flow thresholds. This means enough rain may fall hard enough for a torrent of muddy debris in areas scarred by previous wildfires.
Flood Watch issued for all burn areas in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. In effect from 6 PM Tuesday to 6 AM Wednesday. Peak rain rates of 0.50 to 0.80 inches per hour will be possible, with locally higher rates in thunderstorms. Mud/debris flows likely.

"(Reuters) - Spring has arrived in Southern California and with it a crisis has blossomed in the small city of Lake Elsinore, where tens of thousands of visitors have flocked to see a “superbloom” of poppies in a desert canyon. 
The rare profusion of orange poppies in Walker Canyon, set in the Temescal Mountains and accessible on foot via a trail, owes thanks to above-average rainfall in the arid region. The profusion of tourists in Lake Elsinore, located about 70 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, apparently owes thanks to the popularity of Instagram. 
The hashtag #superbloom had been used over 100,000 times on Instagram as of Monday. 
The city of 63,300 has seen 50,000 tourists from around the country and as far away as Europe come to the 3.5-mile (5.6 km) trail in Walker Canyon over the last two weeks to take in the orange flowers carpeting the surrounding hills. 
The crowds have been so overwhelming that the city of Lake Elsinore shut Walker Canyon for a day to staunch the tourist flood and declared a public safety crisis. The city reopened Walker Canyon on Monday. 
“This year’s is substantially larger than we’ve ever seen in terms of the numbers of flowers and the numbers of visitors,” Lake Elsinore City Hall spokeswoman Nicole Dailey said. The previous superbloom occurred in 2017. 
The droves of people who started coming earlier this month prompted the city to start a shuttle service to Walker Canyon to ease traffic. This past weekend, tourists began lining up for the shuttle at 5:30 a.m., Dailey said, and wait times rose to two hours. 
Some local residents have expressed outrage at the crowds and resulting gridlock, dubbing the superbloom season the “Poppy Apocalypse.” The hashtags #PoppyNightmare and #IsitOverYet have also popped up on social media. 
“We know it has been miserable and has caused unnecessary hardships for our entire community,” a posting on the city’s Facebook page on Sunday said. 
Lake Elsinore Mayor Steve Manos wrote on Facebook on Saturday that a city employee was struck by a hit-and-run driver at the site, and a tourist was bitten by a rattlesnake. 
Lake Elsinore has enlisted the help of the California Highway Patrol, the county sheriff’s office, neighboring cities and private contractors to manage traffic around Walker Canyon, which has no designated public parking. 
Rain in the forecast this week might deter some tourists from coming - or it could cause even more poppies to bloom and attract even more tourists. Dailey said she hoped wet weather would bring some relief for locals. 
“We did not expect the crowds that we saw,” she said. “Our freeways and our cities are not designed for crowds that you see in L.A.”

"Dec. 18, 2018 / 5:34 PM GMT LIMA, Perú The three Venezuelan migrants eke out a living 90 seconds at a time in a busy intersection of Perus capital. When the traffic light flashes red, the acrobatics and break dancing starts. With a captive audience of pedestrians and commuters packed inside city buses, the dancers headstands, dizzying spins and fast-paced steps on a good day net up to $20 in pocket change nearly three times the monthly minimum wage in Venezuela. Maria Molina, upside down, and Miguel Angel Flores break dance for tips from commuters in Lima, Peru, on Dec. 12, 2018. Cesar Olmos / AP It also earned them a brush with a Hollywood superstar Angelina Jolie. You never know how it will go in the street, said dancer Karin Rojas. One day its good and the next day its bad. The trio is just part of a flood of Venezuelans fighting for survival after fleeing their homeland and the worst economic crisis anybody in Latin America can remember. Most Venezuelan migrants head to neighboring Colombia, overwhelming border towns. They hawk their valuables on the street, sell hotdogs or repair shoes. Farther-off Peru is the second-most-common destination. Rojas, 25, and her husband, Francisco Diaz, arrived in Lima in 2016, leaving behind their mountainous home in the Venezuelan state of Merida, where they ran a break dancing collective. In Peru, they met the third partner, Angel Fernandez, a short and stout 22-year-old from their home state. The three settled on a busy intersection in Lima to perform. Six days a week, they bound into the intersection with each red light an exhausting 80 times over a 13-hour workday. They end some days just $5 richer, and hurting physically. The sun cooks the asphalt. Their palms are covered in calluses and fingers sometimes bleed. Rojas says her bones ache and her head throbs. Karin Rojas practices with other break dancers in Lima, Peru, on Dec. 10, 2018. Mauricio Munoz / AP Still, Rojas said, their life is better than in Venezuela, where she would go two days in a row without eating. Now, she can afford three meals a day. Their dancing also caught the attention of Jolie in October, when the American actress visited Lima as a special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Their moves impressed Jolie, and she told them not to give up their dreams. Rojas and Diaz hope to parlay earnings from their street dancing into buying a three-wheel motorcycle taxi, a common form of transportation in Limas poor outskirts. Were never going to stop dancing, Rojas said. Dancing helps us forget all of our sorrows.

"(CNN) After two weeks of historic destruction, the Camp Fire in Northern California is almost contained, but the search for remains threatens to push the death toll over 85, where it stood early Sunday. It's already the state's deadliest fire. Officials found two bodies in Paradise and another in Magalia, both of which sit just west of the Plumas National Forest, roughly 100 miles north of Sacramento. Since it began November 8, the fire has destroyed almost 14,000 homes, 514 businesses and 4,265 other buildings. It has covered more than 153,000 acres, roughly the size of Chicago. The fire is 98% contained, according to Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency. As of Saturday evening, the uncontained portion of the fire was along steep terrain unsafe for firefighters due to recent heavy rains, the agency said. The weather dried up Saturday, however, and it was expected to remain dry through Monday. Firefighters continue to monitor the area and will reassess when it's safe, Cal Fire said. More than 2,500 people are now accounted for, according to the Butte County Sheriff's Office. While 249 people remain missing, the sheriff's office says, that number is down from more than 1,000 just a few days ago. Search for remains continues After days of rain, all flood warnings and watches have expired in the state. While heavy rains can cause floods under normal circumstances, the scorched grounds in the area were especially susceptible to mudslides and flowing debris. The search for remains came to a temporary standstill in Paradise on Friday after rain and strong winds made fire-weakened trees dangerous, CNN affiliate KCRA reported. The search resumed after the winds calmed down. ""You look up, and you see these things hanging in the trees, and now they're blowing around real hard and fall down,"" Craig Covey of the Orange County Fire Authority told the TV station. Rain helped with hot spots Covey is part of the effort to recover remains. He said while the rain helped douse some of the fire and made things easier for the dogs searching for bodies, it also complicated search efforts. ""One of the things that (rain) does do is, it does concentrate the scent into a smaller compartment because of all the ash that was flying around,"" he told KCRA. ""It more compacts it, centralizes it and the dogs (looking for remains) can be very successful in that."" But too much rain can also wash away remains or bury them in the caked mud, making them harder to find. Now that the rains have subsided, crews will assess the areas where the fire is still burning. Cal Fire said it soon expects to have the blaze fully contained. CNN's Hollie Silverman and Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.","After two weeks of historic destruction, the Camp Fire in Northern California is almost contained, but the search for remains threatens to push the death toll over 85, where it stood early Sunday.",2018-11-25T14:59:28Z,3 more bodies found as firefighters have Camp Fire almost snuffed,CNN,0
"Washington (CNN) In a major break with current policy, Central American asylum seekers who arrive at the US border would be forced to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. The Trump administration is preparing to implement sweeping new measures that will turn away Central American asylum seekers at the US border who cannot establish a ""reasonable fear"" of persecution in Mexico, the Post reports, citing a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the paper. The new rules will take effect as soon as Friday, the Post reports. Many of the thousands of migrants making their way to the US say they are fleeing gang violence, persecution and poverty in Central America and hope they'll find safety and security in the US. The plan, called ""Remain in Mexico,"" is a major departure from current procedure, the Post reports, which generally allows asylum seekers who establish a fear of return to their home country to avoid immediate deportation. According to the DHS memo, ""If you are determined to have a reasonable fear of remaining in Mexico, you will be permitted to remain in the United States while you await your hearing before an immigration judge,"" the Post reports. ""If you are not determined to have a reasonable fear of remaining in Mexico, you will remain in Mexico,"" the memo continues, according to the Post. The Post reports US Citizenship and Immigration Services is sending teams of asylum officers to the ports of entry in the San Diego area to implement the new procedures, citing a USCIS official. Reports of the new plan come a day after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from denying asylum claims to immigrants who cross the border illegally. A spokeswoman for DHS, Katie Waldman, issued a statement to the Post late Wednesday and reportedly said there are no immediate plans to implement the new rules. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment. ""The President has made clear every single legal option is on the table to secure our nation and to deal with the flood of illegal immigrants at our borders,"" the statement read, according to the Post. ""DHS is not implementing such a new enforcement program this week,"" Waldman's statement said, according to the Post. ""Reporting on policies that do not exist creates uncertainty and confusion along our borders and has a negative real world impact. We will ensure as always that any new program or policy will comply with humanitarian obligations, uphold our national security and sovereignty, and is implemented with notice to the public and well coordinated with partners."" The White House did not immediately respond to the Post's request for comment.

"(CNN) Heavy rain slid through scorched areas burnt by wildfires in California on Thursday, clogging streets with debris and flooding yards and homes in areas still coming to grips with the disastrous blazes. Rains were letting up early Friday, and flash flood warnings have lapsed. But another half-inch of rain could fall Friday night into Saturday in Northern California's Butte County, which was scorched this month by the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history. ""We just can't catch a break with it right now in the county,"" Cal Fire battalion chief Patrick Purvis told CNN affiliate KOVR on Thursday. ""I mean, we just go from fire season straight into floods, landslides."" The Camp Fire killed at least 88 people, destroyed much of the town of Paradise and scarred tens of thousands of acres of land in Butte County. Thursday's rain fell on the scarred area and flowed into other areas, causing flooding in the town of Durham and clogging some area roads with debris. Firefighters had to rescue people from flooded areas in the Durham area Thursday, the Butte County Fire Department said. In Durham on Thursday night, floodwater was approaching the home of Marie Rappa, who was hosting a family of Camp Fire evacuees. Authorities urged homes in Rappa's area to evacuate because of the flooding, but she and her guests stayed put, CNN affiliate KCRA reported. ""If we evacuate, it'll be a while before we can get back in,"" Rappa told KCRA. ""If we stick around, we can either work through the night or get up early in the morning and get some stuff down and prepare for the next onslaught."" One to 2 inches of rain fell in just an hour Thursday afternoon, mostly between Chico and Paradise, the National Weather Service said. The rain was ""causing mudslides and debris flows"" and clogging drains on California State Route 70 near Pulga, the California Department of Transportation said. Part of the highway was closed Thursday, as workers tried to remove trees and other debris. Meanwhile in Southern California, some people were ordered to evacuate Thursday from areas affected by the Holy Fire, which burned more than 22,000 acres earlier this year. Rain pushed sludge and into streets and yards in Lake Elsinore, pictures released by Cal Fire showed. Firefighters and a public works crew spent part of the day removing about 2 feet of mud from a home's garage there, Cal Fire said on Twitter. Cal Fire released time-lapse footage showing floodwater rushing through burn scars in Leach Canyon, Coldwater Canyon and McVicker Canyon Thursday morning. Thursday's rains also sent rocks and debris spilling onto some roads in Malibu, which was hit by this month's Woolsey Fire, CNN affiliates KCAL/KBCS and KTLA reported. Workers shoveled into the night to clear some of the sludge. Friday is expected to be much drier in the area. Forecasters predicted only a 20% chance of rain in Riverside County on Friday, and a slight chance of showers Saturday afternoon.

"Chicago — The family of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has released a statement saying the actor was the victim of a ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and pushing back against any suggestion that he was anything but truthful with the police.
Detectives have recovered more surveillance footage of Smollett walking in downtown Chicago before and after he says he was attacked by two masked men, including video of him arriving home with a rope around his neck, but they're still searching for any footage of the attack, a police spokesman said Thursday.
Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.

He returned to his apartment afterward and his manager called police from there about 40 minutes later, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.
""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family statement said. ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""
The statement goes on to condemn hate crimes ""happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country."" 
FBI data shows a 17 percent increase in hate crimes nationwide between 2016 and 2017.
Smollett has not spoken publicly about the attack, but his representative told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that the actor was at home and recovering. 
The video from a surveillance camera at Smollett's apartment building showing him arrive home with a rope around his neck is part of a larger effort to obtain as much footage as possible of his walk from a Subway restaurant to his apartment at around 2 a.m. Tuesday.
Guglielmi said detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have pieced together more footage from the hundreds of public and private surveillance cameras in that area of downtown Chicago, which is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants. But they still haven't found video of the attack or the men who match Smollett's description of the suspects, he said.
Guglielmi said there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.
""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.
Probe ongoing in alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett
Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.
Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

— Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) January 31, 2019
Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.
President Donald Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.
""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel Tower.
The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.
In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.
Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.
Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.
Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the best-known examples of the department's use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board president's 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.","Family of the ""Empire"" actor who says he was attacked by men yelling racial and homophobic slurs says his story hasn't changed",2019-01-31T23:44:31Z,"Jussie Smollett's family condemns ""racial and homophobic hate crime""",CBS News,0
"They called him The Plug, slang for drug slinger, and authorities said he kept a gun tucked at his side, boasting he was always ready to shoot.
Bobby Perkins Jr. was also always ready to sell. He would drive from Virginia to a D.C. parking lot with a rental car full of guns, locals told authorities, unloading them from the trunk to whomever would buy. His customers included rivals in a feud between crews in the Northeast Washington neighborhoods where he had grown up.
Perkins, 29, is now in prison for trafficking guns and drugs. The case is an extreme example of how guns regularly flow into the District from Virginia, fueling rising homicides and other crimes; police said most of the firearms that flood the District are bought and resold one by one.
The District functionally has no gun dealers and a serious gun problem, said Thomas L. Chittum III, chief of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosivess Washington field office. Those guns arent falling from the sky, theyre being trafficked.
Of the 224 guns prosecutors know Perkins sold in just five months of 2015, 94 have been recovered at crime scenes from Virginia to New York, officials said. Five were linked to homicides two in the District, one in Prince Georges County.
One was used to kill Perkinss teenage cousin.
Bryan Perkins was on the way to the store with his mothers credit card when he passed a group throwing dice outside his familys apartment in Edgewood, in Northeast. It was just after 9 p.m. on a July night in 2015.
Police said at least one gunman opened fire on the group, hitting three players and Bryan, 18. The bullet pierced his chest.
Bobby, who grew up nearby, had cheered his younger cousin at high school basketball games. And while relatives didnt see Bobby at his cousins large funeral, he was at the reception. Bryan had looked up to Bobby, who had served in the Marine Corps, worked as an electrician and had a wife and two small children.
Federal law enforcement officials said Bobby Perkins heard on the street that a gun he sold was used in the killing and wanted to retaliate. To the victims mother, who didnt know about the gun connection until told by a Washington Post reporter, the news was crazy.
Said Ebony Perkins, I just broke down.
D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham called the case a complete tragedy. With homicides in the nations capital spiking to 160 last year, the chief has frequently blamed the deadly violence on what he says is easy access to illegal guns.
While in prison, he said, Bobby Perkins can think about his family who suffered. Its got to be tough for him. Maybe he hadnt given a lot of thought to what he was doing. This is the real-world version of what can happen with these guns.
Bobby Perkinss immediate family declined to be interviewed, but court filings sketch his biography.
Growing up in the D.C. area, he was expelled from high school in the 10th grade but got back on track and earned his GED at age 16. He printed out fliers and went door-to-door seeking odd jobs, his mother told a judge in a letter, saving up money to buy a car. He learned the electricians trade and qualified as an airport firefighter by the Defense Department. He joined the Marine Corps and became an aircraft rescue and firefighting specialist when he was 18.

But at some point, ATF officials said, Perkins began convincing fellow Marines to buy firearms, report them stolen and sell them to him. He would then sell the weapons in the D.C. area for a profit, the officials said.
A Marines spokeswoman said Perkins was given an early discharge because the character of his service was incongruent with Marine Corps expectations and standards. The Marines declined to provide additional details.
Perkins first came on local law enforcements radar in 2014, when a man was arrested with one of his guns after taking a wrong turn on a pizza run and ending up at the CIA. The investigation intensified when a Naval veteran in Richmond named Leonard Laraway was picked up by ATF and admitted selling at least 200 guns to a man he knew as Bob.
Determining the legality of gun sales between individuals in Virginia can be difficult. Records are not required, and the seller does not have to ask if the buyer is a state resident or prohibited from possessing a firearm.
Unlicensed dealing is one of the biggest challenges we face, Chittum said. A lot of times we dont identify these firearm trafficking schemes until guns are recovered often in violent crimes and then working back.
Thats how ATF found Laraway, who pleaded guilty to unlicensed firearms dealing and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Laraway could not be reached and his attorney declined to comment.
Laraway cooperated with agents, giving them records. Weapons he sold to Perkins were repeatedly linked to crimes, but still the case stalled.
Despite an exhaustive search, law enforcement officers were unable to locate a single witness willing to admit that he purchased a firearm from Perkins that Perkins had originally acquired from Laraway, Assistant U.S. Attorney Carina Cuellar said in a statement.
But Perkins, who had moved to Stafford, Va., had also come to the attention of local law enforcement as part of an investigation into violent drug dealers. Federal prosecutors realized there was another way into the case.
Locals began linking Perkins to both drugs and firearms. He was seldom seen without a gun, even in his apartment, according to court documents. One person told agents Perkins kept a gun on the kitchen table, one on top of the refrigerator near the stove where powder cocaine was cooked into crack and one on the couch when he watched TV.
Witnesses told ATF that Perkins had provided a gun to a man who used it to kill someone and described seeing his distinctive navy blue BMW at shooting scenes.
In January 2016, Perkins was arrested after a drive-by shooting in his neighborhood. No one was wounded, but over two dozen shell casings were scattered outside an apartment building. That case is pending in Stafford County court; a co-conspirator was convicted of crimes related to firing a weapon.
Cuellar said many witnesses initially were reluctant to come forward, but after the secrecy of the federal grand jury was explained to them, many of these witnesses had a change of heart.
Perkins ultimately pleaded guilty in federal court in Alexandria, Va., to illegally dealing guns in the District and beyond and selling cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines. He told the judge that while he had an affinity for guns, Im not a violent person. I dont I dont like to deal in violence.
His attorney, C. Dean Latsios, disputed the stated observances of some of the government witnesses and noted the line always ready to shoot came from a dubious source an uncorroborated statement from an informant and felon paid $200.
A federal prosecutor urged a tough sentence, writing in a court document that the killing of Perkinss cousin underscores the unpredictability and cruelty of gun violence.
In August 2018, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III gave Perkins 12 years in prison, sweeping aside Perkinss arguments, telling him, You clearly were surrounded by instruments of violence.
Bobby Perkinss family lived in Fort Totten; Bryans about a mile south in Edgewood. Bobby Perkins frequently saw his cousins, Bryan and his older brother, Dezmoine, at family cookouts, basketball and football games.
Dezmoine was shot in May 2010 outside the familys apartment. Ebony Perkins remembers the frantic call from neighbors and rushing to cradle her son as he died.
He was 16.
Bryan was 10 at the time, and his mother said he struggled. He would say things like they should be together, Ebony Perkins said.
Bryan tried to distract himself by focusing on basketball, his mother said. He later expressed interest in designing his own clothing line. Eventually he entered an alternative school for students with social and emotional needs.
On a Friday night, July 17, 2015, his mother gave him a credit card, and he headed to the store. He was shot as he passed or paused at the dice game. Ebony does not believe her son was the target.
No arrest has been made. But authorities said a gun found by police in the District one year later was linked to the shooting. Seized guns are test-fired and signature markings made as bullets travel through the barrel are entered into a nationwide database and compared to those on bullets used in crimes.
For Ebony, knowing the gun that killed her son originated in her own family only adds to her anguish. Every so often, she said a homicide detective invites her to the station to talk.
I just dont go anymore, she said. I ask them, Is there something new you have to tell me before I waste my time? Scared of the violence, she moved out of the city to a smaller apartment in Maryland with her surviving son and 8-year-old daughter.
My heart does not beat the same since I lost Dezmoine, she said. And just as I started to recover from Dezmoine, it turned around and happened to Bryan.
Ebony said she hasnt heard from Bobby Perkins.
He probably dont know what to say to me, Ebony said. Im not going to tell him its his fault, because its not. He didnt know it was going to happen.","He trafficked 224 guns; one was used to kill his cousin The Washington Post Virginia man admits buying guns in Virginia, then selling them for profit in the District.",2019-01-24T12:00:28Z,He trafficked 224 guns; one was used to kill his cousin - The Washington Post,The Washington Post,0
"A report published Thursday by Christian Aid, a U.K.-based charity, found that 2018's top three most expensive climate-driven events worldwide took place in the United States. They were hurricanes Florence and Michael, followed by California's wildfires.
With 12 distinct billion-dollar events tallied so far in the U.S., 2018 also ranks fourth among the years with the greatest number of billion-dollar disasters, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. All of the top four years in terms of extreme weather event costs are recent -- in addition to 2018, they are 2011, 2016 and 2017. 
This is no coincidence: we have more expensive stuff in harm's way and climate change is super-charging storms. As a result, extreme weatheris happening more frequently,and the damages that go along with it are increasing.    
Climate Central
The Christian Aidreport focused on 10 of the most destructive weather events around the world in 2018. Topping the list were hurricanes Florence and Michael, costing an estimated $17 billion and $15 billion this year, respectively.
It said the disasters noted in the report ""are not normal: they were worsened or made more likely by climate change, or both.""
It also said they are not ""the new normal."" 
""There will not be any new normal as long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to push up global temperatures - extreme weather events will constantly become increasingly common and more extreme,"" it said.  
Here is a look back at hurricanes Florence and Michael, as well as some of 2018's other memorable weather and climate events in the U.S. -- and their costs: 
Hurricane Florence, September 2018
Florence, at one point, was a Category 4 storm with winds of 140 mph. By the time it made landfall on September 14, however, it weakened to a Category 1, and its slow speed at that time is what defined the hurricane. 
Because of how slowly it moved over land, it will be remembered as the worst flood in modern history for much of southeast North Carolina and parts of South Carolina. Both states set new all-time rainfall records, with a maximum total of nearly 3 feet in North Carolina and almost 2 feet in South Carolina.
The damage is estimated to be $17 billion, according to Christian Aid.
New studies show slower-moving tropical cyclones and a warmer atmosphere caused by climate change result in hurricanes dumping heavier rain.
Hurricane Michael, October 2018
Michael will be remembered for ferocious 155-mph winds in its core. Energized by above-normal water temperatures -- in the low to mid-80s -- over the northern Gulf of Mexico, the storm rapidly intensified 80 mph in just 48 hours. When it made landfall, it was still intensifying and almost became a Category 5 -- the strongest of hurricanes.
It was the strongest storm on record to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle, the strongest U.S. mainland landfall in October, the third strongest landfall by pressure, and the fourth strongest by wind.
In total, damage estimates for the storm are between $15 and $25 billion, according Christian Aid and Bloomberg News, respectively.
New studies show that warmer water caused by climate change is likely to fuel a greater number of Category 4 and 5 storms.
California wildfires 
For the people of California, the state's deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record will remain burned in the memory of residents. Close to 1.9 million acres have been ravaged, placing it ahead of the historic 2008 season, which burned 1.6 million acres.
The state's Camp Fire cost an estimated $7.5-10 billion, according to Christian Aid report, while the Woolsey Fire cost an estimated $1.5-3 billion.
California wildfires are caused by an ignition, either natural or human caused, combined with very dry, warm conditions and bursts of gusty down-sloping winds. These conditions are present almost every fire season, and that was especially true in 2018. But as the climate changes, scientists have found that fire season is now almost three months longer and the number of acres burned in the American West have increased dramatically since the 1970s.
Severe weather and Ellicott City flooding, March-May 2018
Toward the end of March, severe weather and tornadoes, including an EF3 tornado, pummeled the Southeast, causing $1.4 billion in damage. 
In early May, a large severe weather outbreak with tornadoes, large hail and wind swept from the Plain states to the Northeast, costing another $1 billion. 
Mid-May featured back-to-back derechos, known for damaging winds. That event hit hard from Pennsylvania to southeast New England down to Washington, D.C., costing another $1.4 billion in damage.
The most memorable event of May, however, was disastrous flooding in Old Ellicott City, Maryland, on the 27th. Eight inches of rain fell in just a few hours, causing a cascade of rapids in the city center.
4 nor'easters in 3 weeks, March 2018
In a sight not seen in modern history, dubbed #foureaster, four nor'easters pounded the Northeast on March 2, March 7, March 13 and March 21. The first of those storms alone is estimated to have cost $2.25 billion, with nearly 40 inches of snow in the Catskills of New York and a wind gust to 97 mph on Cape Cod. 
The succession of four back-to-back storms had some meteorologists wondering if climate change may somehow be loading the dice for unusual events like this. 
East coast ""bomb cyclone"" blizzard, January 2018
Estimated to have cost $1.1 billion in damage, the impacts of the bomb cyclone were felt from Florida to Maine. Measurable snow was reported as far south as Tallahassee, Florida, for the first time in nearly 30 years. The worst impacts were seen in eastern Massachusetts, where Cape Cod reported 2 feet of snow, hurricane force wind gusts and all-time record breaking storm surge flooding in Boston.","Extreme weather is happening more frequently, and the damages that go along with it are increasing",2018-12-29T00:18:11Z,2018's most expensive climate-driven events took place in U.S.,CBS News,0
"Wall construction on the southern border is underway according to a report in the Washington Examiner, look at this, miles of desperately need brand new steel barriers are under construction all along the Rio Grande Valley. This portion of the wall was funded with federal money previously negotiated by the Trump administration. Nobody seems to report that. We've also repaired a lot of the bad walls out there.  And there is new construction.
Meanwhile, this garbage deal that I've been telling you about, out of Washington, which allocates a measly additional $1.375 billion for wall construction -- well, that has not been signed by the president. As a matter of fact, nobody in the White House has seen any language in the bill. None.
So, let's be frank. It's not nearly enough money. Washington lawmakers, the swamp creatures, they have once again let we, the people, the American people down, this is a swamp compromise.  Now, let me make predictions.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEAN HANNITY
Based on what the president is saying publicly, and I love the press, they love to speculate, how did Hannity get his information?
All right. We know this is a president that keeps his promises. And he goes at the speed of Trump. And if you watch every speech, if you actually listen to Donald Trump's words, you know, especially you people in the hate-Trump media, he telegraphs. He's saying exactly what he's planning to do. You're too stupid to listen.
Here’s this: “So much crime comes in through the southern border. Illegal immigration provides a lucrative cash flow to put it mildly, lucrative, to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet.  These deadly cartels flood our city with narcotics that kill thousands of citizens, ruin families.  They use fear, intimidation, violence to get their way.
There's only one moral course of action, to put these ruthless criminal cartels out of business and out of business fast.  I will never waiver from my sacred duty to defend this nation and its people.  We will get the job done.”
All right. He's saying he's going to get the job done.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FULL EPISODE
Let me make a prediction, let's base it on what you just heard -- and what we've witnessed the last two years -- the president is going to find a way to get the money.
Now, look at this bill, $1.375 billion, not enough. But it will keep the ball in the project moving along assuming, we haven't seen the language, there's no poison pill or restrictions in there thrown in by a swamp creature in the last minute that says you can't build a wall with the money. If that happens I don't think the president will sign that bill. And in that case you probably move to a short-term continuing resolution and the Congress creatures go back to doing the crappy work they usually do.  And then if they get it right, he'll sign that bill.
But let's assume that they get it right.  That, in other words, he gets $1.375 billion for the wall now -- well that, prevents the government shutdown. That's a good thing.
But in order to meet on borders and our security needs, the president has stated publicly, not just to Sean Hannity, that he will also tap in to hundreds of millions, at least $900 million, I'm told the number is much higher, other discretionary funds that he can direct that money directly to the wall which then brings to us two or three billion dollars. Again, in the interim, and it sounds like what he's saying is he's going to simultaneously declare a national emergency, to free up billions more.
Now, the hate-Trump media, if that happens, are going to feign moral indignation. Outrage, hysteria will break out.  Meanwhile, they'll say, “how did Hannity know?” Well, because I've listened to him and he's telling you the entire time what he's going to do.
Here are two examples: Donald Trump: “I will add whatever I have to add to build the wall.” President tweeting: “I am getting almost $23 billion for border security.”
Now, that money, the $23 billion he's talking about, that can be spent on everything else but the wall.  But if he declares a national emergency, or uses the law which we've been citing on this program, U.S. Code 284, well, we know what the Democrats are going to do. They're going to immediately run to the courts, they'll go judge shopping to find a liberal activist judge somewhere in California, or anywhere in the Ninth Circuit.
They will lose. The president will lose the first round. Go to the ninth circuit. He'll lose the second round.
But in the interim, he still gets $1.375 billion, so he continues the project, and with the other funds, continues the project.  And I believe when it gets to the Supreme Court, he's going to win.
And this Supreme Court has to take this case, considering -- let's see, it's a constitutional question about his role as commander-in-chief.  It's about separation of powers.  It's about national security.
And just a side note, all of you in the media, I don't know why, everyone has been obsessed, “Hannity's predicting this.” That's what I'm predicting is going to happen, because I actually listened to the publicly stated words of the president. So, keep speculating, nobody in the media has any idea who my sources are, who they're not, and who I talk to, who I don't talk to. And I will not reveal my sources.
And all of these hate-Trump media outlets, they all pretend they're unbiased, that they're journalists.  Well, I don't claim to be a journalist, we do journalism, but what we say about being a talk show host, we're like the whole newspaper. Now, we do straight news when there's a war, straight news on weather, straight news on important incidences that are happening, like Ferguson when that was happening, or, Baltimore.  And then we give a lot of opinion.  So, we're the news page, editorial page, the opinion page. We even do gossip and sports like tonight for example, Tim Tebow is on. So, we're like, the whole newspaper. That's what we do, freedom of the press. But we identify what we do.
Now, we do our own research, like we did with vetting Obama, like we do on the deep state, we do investigations, we bring you news and information you won't hear or see anywhere else.  And opinion you won't get anywhere else.
But all of these hate Trump news people that claim to be journalists, no, they're really editorial writers.  And ones that make up a lot of B.S. at the same time.
So, tonight, when it comes to building the wall, whatever has to be done, the president is saying will be done. Not for political reasons, but for the safety and the security of all Americans.
He sees this so rightly as a life and death issue. But don't just take my word for it. Maybe some of the people on the fake news channels, maybe they should start speaking to Angel Moms and Dads. Maybe a woman like Maureen Maloney, her son, Matthew, was killed by a drunk driving illegal immigrant from Ecuador.
You got that, Senator Menendez? -- Menendez was upset that illegal immigrants could actually be classified as criminals, if they get caught drunk driving.
And, Tuesday, Maloney urged President Trump to hold strong in the fight for the border wall. Now, sadly, she is among thousands of our fellow Americans whose lives have been ripped apart, permanent separation, by violent criminals because we have open borders that have entered this country illegally.  In the past two years alone, ICE arresting illegal immigrants accused or convicted of 4,000 murder, homicide charges.
Carnage from illegal drugs -- 90 percent of the heroin crossing that southern border is even worse.  Every single week, 300 Americans are dying from heroin overdoses, almost all of which is trafficked across the border.
Now, that's why Americans are overwhelmingly backing up the president and his plan to secure the border.
There’s a brand new Fox New poll that’s out on Wednesday night and it finds that 66 percent of Americans approve of the president's efforts. You Republicans in the House and Senate, you may just want to follow his lead. It’s good politics.
According to Gallup, the president's overall poll numbers are up a whopping 7 points since the government shutdown. He hit his highest number, 52 percent, on the Rasmussen poll. Earlier this week, he filled an arena in El Paso, Texas. Look at that.
And, oh, that's inside the arena, am I correct? Yes, then he had thousands and thousands of others outside the arena. Nobody in the media talks about this. What other president got those types of crowds?
Now, some on the left try to pretend, the president has no support at all. I've never seen a president with more support. Look at late night loser Stephen Colbert. Just last week, he said this:
“Trump's inaugural committee raised a record $107 million which was double the previous record set by Barack Obama.  What was all that money for?  I mean, obviously, they didn't need it for crowd control.”
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
OK, Colbert, so you show the picture from before the inauguration. Don't worry, your audience is stupid enough to believe your crap.
Maybe Colbert needs to attend a Trump rally. Maybe he will see the unbelievable enthusiasm, the people standing for hours and hours and hours outside in the cold and the rain, and then standing for the entire time the president is speaking, supporting his agenda.

 (CNN)After seven years of drought, elated cattle farmers in the Australian state of Queensland welcomed the rainstorms heading their way as a blessing. 
But now, after one of the most devastating deluges in state history, a billion-dollar industry could be left in tatters. 
Authorities estimate that nearly 500,000 cattle -- worth about $213 million (AU$300 million) -- have been killed by flooding in Queensland's north since the rain began falling late last month, CNN affiliate Seven News reported. 
The downpours have ended but the cattle carcasses remain, baking in the record-breaking summer heat. If not buried or burned, they will pose a health hazard. Video taken from overhead at one location shows scores of dead cattle huddled together amid the devastation. 
""People have gone through drought, they have come out of years and years of drought, and they have now gone smack-bang into a natural disaster the likes of which no one out there has seen before,"" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.
But cattle farmers and industry lobbyists say the worst could be yet to come. 
Australia's beef industry is one of the country's biggest economic drivers, with exports in 2017 worth $5.3 billion (AU$7.4 billion). About $6.1 billion (AU$8.6 billion) worth of beef was consumed domestically from July 2017 until June 2018, according to trade group Meat &amp; Livestock Australia. 
The CEO of rural production advocate Agforce Queensland, Michael Guerin, described the flooding as a ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""a disaster of unprecedented proportion."" 
""The speed and intensity of the unfolding tragedy makes it hard to believe that it's just a week since farmers' elation at receiving the first decent rains in five years turned to horror at the devastating and unprecedented flood that quickly followed,"" he said. 
""Although we won't know the full extent of the livestock losses and infrastructure damage until the water fully recedes, it is certain that the industry will take decades to recover.""
Many of the cattle that survived can't be reached since roads aren't passable yet. Authorities have resorted to air drops to provide feed, but the affected areas are so vast they may not be able to reach all the animals in need. 
Georgie Somerset, the general president of Agforce Queensland, said on Tuesday that ""we're literally ferrying one barrel of hay at a time to feed the stock that we can find."" 
Many cattle farmers are bracing for major losses. The Queensland government is providing emergency hardship assistance to those affected. Farmers are eligible for grants up to $53,000 but may need more to rebuild herds.
Cattle farmer Jodi Keough told Seven News she expected to lose half her herd, adding that if authorities do nothing ""we're talking about a possible collapse of a primary industry in Australia.""","After seven years of drought, the cattle farmers in the Australian province of Queensland thought the rain heading their way was a blessing.",2019-02-13T05:26:23Z,"Queensland floods: 500,000 cattle survived years-long drought only to die in the rain",CNN,0

(CNN) When Liu Guoliang puts on his makeup and straps on his stilts, he's participating in a Chinese tradition that's been in existence for centuries, if not millennia.
There are many different origin stories for stilt walking in China, and historical references dating as far back as 5 BCE. 
In northern Hebei province, the legend goes that hundreds of years ago a flash flood struck, threatening villages with destruction. 
In a moment of benevolence, 12 spirits floating on clouds blocked the path of the waters and averted catastrophe. 
Representing these spirits, the stilt walkers are supposed to bring good luck, and for centuries they'd be present at any major event in Chinese life, including New Year celebrations, important birthdays and funerals. 
""We're professionals,"" says Liu following a performance at a Chinese New Year fair in Baoding, a city in Hebei province. ""As long as people need us to perform, we'll go.""
The tradition has evolved differently in various parts of the country. 
Hebei stilt walkers stand a meter or so above the ground, dressed as one of a dozen spirits, including the big-headed ghost, the medicine man or the king of evil.
The troupe travels from town to town, announcing their presence with the crashing of drums and cymbals. The traditional routine involves dancing, jumping over increasingly high benches and balancing on one leg in a kind of sideways split. 
For this their troupe master Liu Guozheng, who goes by the stage name of Hong Long, pays the walkers 60,000 to 70,000 RMB per year (about $9,000 to $10,000). When not on the road the performers live together on his old family farm. 
Audiences crave bigger thrills, say performers
It's a hard life. Falls and fractures are inevitable, says Liu, who, at 37, has been training for more than 10 years.
But as China modernizes, the stilt walkers are facing a new challenge: keeping their audience interested.
""Before we'd just go from village to village, walk around and that was it,"" says Liu. ""But now there aren't many people who like that kind of performance. To put it coarsely, they're a bit sick of it.""
As long as people need us to perform, we'll go.
So the troupe has gradually been working on some new moves, and for inspiration they looked to the Internet.
""We got this new style from these videos online showing street dance moves,"" says Liu.
In a prefab metal warehouse on the edge of Baoding, the stilt walkers train three hours a day, replicating the moves they found online -- but with giant wooden poles attached to their feet. 
""They're all pretty dangerous,"" admits Liu of the moves.
""It's changed so much,"" says troupe leader Hong. ""Our original style of stilt walking was more about the twirly dancing...There was almost no acrobatics in the performances.""
So far, the sacrifice has paid off. There's renewed interest in the stilt walkers and the troupe has even appeared on Chinese state TV. 
""We often go to places and get so many people going, 'My God, that's awesome,'"" adds Liu.
For Liu to be able to keep the tradition alive, the risk is worth it.","As China modernizes, the country's traditional stilt walkers are facing a new challenge: how to keep audiences interested.",2019-02-22T01:18:33Z,China's street-dancing stilt walkers risk safety in exchange for thrills,CNN,0
"Tica, Mozambique (CNN)It has been nearly two weeks since Tropical Cyclone Idai ripped through Mozambique, razing buildings and submerging entire towns and villages -- but even now the human toll is yet to be fully understood. 
The Category 2 storm -- which made landfall in the early hours of March 15 with 175 kph (110 mph) winds and heavy rains -- has decimated this southern African country. 
Driving away from the airport in Beira, a port city that bore the brunt of the cyclone, it was impossible to escape the sight of debris. As the rain eases, residents are emerging to surveying the ruins that remain and begin their clean-up efforts. 
Drone footage shot by CNN between Beira and the village of Tica has revealed the extent of the damage in cyclone-hit areas. 
Factories have been ripped clean apart while the entire aluminum roof of a school building was hanging precariously, as if someone reached down from the heavens and torn it off. 
Nothing in Beira -- from the cathedral to restaurants, banks and the port, where the cyclone dislodged shipping containers -- escaped Idai's wrath. 
From affluent homes built in eye-catching Portuguese colonial style to more modest properties, the tropical cyclone took something. 
Telecom masts, satellite feeds and the internet all bowed to its force. The overall effect was that Idai knocked this thriving port city into a pre-digital world. 
Yet it's not until you leave Beira that the cyclone's destructive powers are really exposed. 
On the road to Tica, around 80 kilometers (49 miles) from Beira's beaches, drone footage revealed massive tracts of waterlogged land and huge trees snapped like twigs. 
This road into the interior of Mozambique should lead all the way to Zimbabwe with the sea firmly in the rear-view mirror. 
Instead, the huge swathes of inland water that are visible from space greet motorists. 
For so many, these waters have taken over their lives. Farmers' crops have disappeared, and their livestock are left to wade through the murky waters in search of somewhere to graze. 
Complicating the situation further, the flooding will not clear away anytime soon as rains have continued to fall. 
The new homeless are left with no choice but to trudge through the waterlogged landscape towards hastily improvised shelters. 
More than half a million people have been affected in the country and at least 110,000 have sought refuge in camps. 
Meanwhile, the humanitarian efforts to reach those trapped continue but collapsed roads are hampering progress. 
With no other option, some people are using rudimentary canoes to cross the flooded plains while others are trudging across higher ground to safe havens several hours walk away. 
One eye witness told CNN that in areas where flood waters were still high, people were joining hands to form human chains. 
Mozambique's Minister of Land and Environment, Celso Correia, said on Sunday that 446 people have now been reported dead in the country. But aid agencies say it is premature to say how many people have been killed while some affected areas remain inaccessible. 
Many are wondering at what might come in the next few days in this heady mixture of undiscovered dead, stifling heat and flooded land. 
Eye witnesses have given ghastly accounts of corpses. One described seeing 300 to 400 bodies wash up on a flooded stretch of road just north of Tica. 
Mozambican President Philippe Nyesi has called this ""a disaster of great proportions,"" and its full extent is yet to be truly realized.

Think of a prison and you might think of an imposing building surrounded by barbed wired, flood lights and extensive alarm systems.
So it may come as a surprise that a prison in Sweden recently won an award for being environmentally friendly. 
Tabellen 4, a building in Sollentuna high-security remand prison in Stockholm, won the 2019 BREEAM Public Projects In-Use award for its range of eco-friendly initiatives including a 1,100 square meter green roof made of plants and turf, a ventilation system that recycles heat from the air, and a waste disposal room with storage for eight categories of waste. 
The building is also wrapped in 6,000 square meters of insulting glass, which regulates its temperature -- and has built-in alarms. 
""The judges were impressed by the way they had tackled sustainability issues through the physicality of the building, regardless of security issues,"" said Alan Yates, chair of the judging panel. 
A green roof and greener sentence 
Bought in 2010 by Swedish company Vasce, Tabellen 4 was adapted by working alongside the Swedish Prison and Probation service (Kriminalvarden). 
Vegetation and turf ""protects the roof from [solar] radiation, rainfall and temperature changes,"" as well helping ""facilitate the run-off of surface water onto the property, while also enabling pollination ... for insects,"" said Sara Jägermo, Vasce's head of property. 
This is ""of most importance since the bee population is declining,"" Jägermo said, adding that ""mixed vegetation around the building"" has the additional benefit of creating a ""more harmonious impression.""
Other features include installing low-flush wet rooms that reduce water consumption, fridges that are more energy-efficient and shifting to LED lighting, which can be switched on and off from a central surveillance center.
The building is heated and cooled using a mechanical ventilation system, which recycles energy in the air. According to Vasce, this system has reduced the energy used for heating by 50-60%. 
In addition all food waste from the prison kitchen is converted into biogas, 12% of the food offered is organic and at least two meals per week are vegetarian, according to Patrik Snellman, formerly assistant governor of Sollentuna.
There is also an underground corridor connecting the prison, prosecutor's office and court house, so ""prisoners can be transported safely without cars,"" said Snellman. 
Benefitting the world -- and prisoner wellbeing 
The improvements to Tabellen 4 are part of a wider effort from the Kriminalvarden to increase the wellbeing of people who interact with prisons. 
""Employees, detainees, relatives and other visitors have presumed higher stress levels in an institutional environment like this,"" said Jägermo. ""Research clearly shows that people are more contented in verdant settings, have better concentration and demonstrate more empathy, which, in turn, leads to better results, improved concentration and less sick leave."" 
Are eco-friendly prisons the future?
BREEAM is an environmental assessment method operated by the UK-based Building Research Establishment (BRE). Its awards recognize the ""most innovatively sustainable BREEAM rated buildings of the previous 12 months."" 
According to BRE, Tabellen 4 highlights the diversity of building types focusing on environmental improvement.
Sollentuna is not the first prison to aim towards sustainability.
Bostoy prison in Norway usessolar panels, produces its own food and recycles everything it can. Coyote Ridge Corrections Center in Washington State built solar panels that cover 16,929 square feet, reportedly saving $370,000 in energy costs a year and Cedar Creek Corrections Center also in Washington State even produces honey from the prison's own hives. 
But the lessons to be learnt from Tabellen 4 extend further than prisons, according to Yates. 
""Just because you've got limitations, don't dismiss the opportunities that exist,"" said Yates. ""Yes, it will limit what you can do, but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't mean that you can't tackle sustainability as an issue. You really ought to.""","A prison in Sweden has won an award for its eco-friendly initiatives including a green roof, insulting glass and a ventilation system that recycles heat from the air.",2019-04-02T11:03:08Z,Locked up and living sustainably: Eco-friendly prison wins award,CNN,0

Don Lutes Jr. kept the 1943 copper penny he stumbled upon in his high school cafeteria seven decades ago in a safe behind a wall in his Massachusetts home.
All US pennies were supposed to be made of zinc-coated steel that year to conserve the copper needed for wartime essentials like shell casings and telephone wire, according to Heritage Auctions, a Dallas-based auction house. But a small number of copper pennies were created by mistake. Only a few of them exist today, making them special to coin collectors.
Lutes knew his coin was rare and held on to it. But as his health declined last year, Lutes decided to sell the coin, said Peter Karpenski, a friend and fellow coin collector.
Lutes' prized possession could fetch a pretty penny. Heritage Auctions, which is overseeing the sale, estimates the coin is worth at least $170,000.
The top bid after a two-week online auction is $130,000, according to Heritage Auctions. The online auction ends at 6 p.m. Thursday when a live auction will begin at the Florida United Numismatics convention in Orlando. 
""What makes this so exciting is that it's the only time ever in history when the discovery coin for this piece has been available for sale. In other words, this was the first one that was ever found,"" said Sarah Miller, Director of Numismatics for Heritage Auctions' New York office.
The 1943 copper penny ""is the most famous error coin,"" according to Heritage Auctions.
Around the end of 1942, a small number of bronze planchets -- a plain metal disk that is stamped as a coin -- got caught in the trap doors of the mobile tote bins used to feed the blanks into the Mint's coin presses, according to Heritage Auctions. Those planchets went unnoticed when the bins were refilled with zinc-coated steel planchets in 1943, Heritage Auctions said. 
""They eventually became dislodged and were fed into the coin press, along with the wartime steel blanks. The few resulting copper cents were lost in the flood of millions of steel cents struck in 1943 and escaped detection by the Mint's quality control measures,"" according to Heritage Auctions.
Miller said 10 to 15 of the 1943 copper pennies exist today.
Lutes set his 1943 copper penny aside to study it later when he found it in a bundle of change in the Pittsfield High School cafeteria in 1947.
A US Army veteran, he would amass some 50,000 coins by the 1970s when he retired from the family manufacturing business, according to Karpenski. Lutes died in September 2018 at the age of 87, according to Miller. 
The Pittsfield resident was a quiet man with a small circle of friends that included fellow members of the coin and genealogy clubs he belonged to. A widower, he volunteered for decades at Berkshire Athenaeum, Pittsfield's public library, according to Karpenski, who owns a coin store in Pittsfield. 
The library named a volunteer of the year award after him, according to Karpenski. 
And the library meant just as much to Lutes. 
Lutes wanted the proceeds from the sale of his prized penny to go to the library, Miller said.",Don Lutes Jr. kept the 1943 copper penny he stumbled upon in his high school cafeteria seven decades ago in a safe behind a wall in his Massachusetts home.,2019-01-10T11:09:07Z,Rare 1943 copper coin could fetch a pretty penny in auction,CNN,0
"(CNN)Thawing ice from last week's extreme cold is jamming up rivers in the Midwest and Northeast -- causing evacuations and a big, wet mess.
Rapid warmups can cause ice jams in rivers. The ice doesn't crack uniformly, and chunks can temporarily block the river's flow, causing it to spill inland.
Here are some of the places where we've seen ice-jam flooding this week:
Upstate New York, near Buffalo
Broken ice crammed Buffalo-area waterways like Buffalo Creek in West Seneca.
The flooding started Monday evening, forcing West Seneca residents out of about a dozen homes, CNN affiliate WKBW reported.
Water deluged the basement and furnaces of a six-unit apartment building owned by Sandy Kelly. ""I've seen ice build up in the creek, but nothing like this,"" she told WKBW.
A drone flown by Seneca police recorded video of the Buffalo Creek flooding. 
In the town of Evan, south of Buffalo, an ice jam on Big Sister Creek left 4 feet of water in Diane Felt's basement, CNN affiliate WIVB reported.
""We're pretty much definitely underwater,"" Felt told WIVB on Tuesday. ""In years past, they used to dynamite [the ice] when we were kids, and once that is opened up, then the ice jams flow, but until that happens, this is jammed right up.""
The area could see more flooding Thursday and into next week, the National Weather Service said.
Heavy rains and rising temperatures Thursday ""could have possible impacts on area creeks and rivers, especially any that recently experienced ice jam flooding,"" the weather service said in a statement Wednesday.
An ice jam on Grand River sent water spilling into the Michigan city of Portland early Wednesday, causing about 50 residents to evacuate their homes, city officials said.
Someone woke up Pat Kline with a phone call, telling her that several inches of water had reached her antiques and crafts shop, CNN affiliate WXMI reported. 
""When I got here I was shocked because my basement has never flooded before,"" Kline told WXMI. ""We do have some damage, things got wet, they're antiques, handmade items and yes things get damaged.""
Rescuers used boats to ferry some residents out of flooded homes, including Devon Cyr, to safety in the city about 25 miles northwest of Lansing, CNN affiliate WOOD reported.
""The car in the garage had water. It was beeping, lights were going. My sister's car had water on it,"" Cyr told WOOD. ""We had to get our stuff around, and they had to evacuate us and they pulled up a boat to our porch.""
Near the small southern Minnesota city of Houston, the Root River was jammed up and causing fields to flood Tuesday, CNN affiliate KTTC reported.
That night into Wednesday, the Whitewater River also flooded in the southeastern part of the state, forcing officials to close a section of Minnesota State Highway 74, KTTC reported.

"(CNN)President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and Russia investigation cooperator Michael Flynn will be a ""principal witness"" in the upcoming trial of his former lobbying partner -- and his statements to special counsel Robert Mueller will matter in that case too, according to court submissions on Friday.
The flood of court requests from the lobbyist Bijan Kian made clear how much of the case will focus on Flynn. Kian's defense team wants every document it can get about the former Trump administration official as they prepare for trial.
Kian's legal team wants ""all statements, transcripts, notes, records and memoranda"" from federal prosecutors that reflate to anything Flynn said to ""any agent, employee, representative or elected official"" of the US government.
That includes investigators' memoranda of interviews Flynn gave to Mueller's legal team as they investigated the election and the Trump political operation.
Those notes -- especially about Flynn lying to Vice President Mike Pence and others in the early days of the Trump administration about his contact with Russia regarding sanctions -- could help Kian's lawyers cut into his credibility at trial, Kian's lawyers wrote. They've asked for the Mueller memos on Flynn but the Justice Department won't turn them over as potentially exculpatory material for Kian, the defense team wrote.
The court submissions on Friday also reveal just how long ago Flynn started helping the prosecutors with the Kian case. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia sought an interview and grand jury testimony from Flynn as early as June 2018, about six months after Mueller secured his guilty plea.
Kian, also known as Bijan Rafiekian, was charged with working illegally for the Turkish government in the US and pleaded not guilty in December. His trial is scheduled for July in the Eastern District of Virginia. 
Flynn, Kian and another lobbying associate, the Istanbul-based businessman Kamil Ekim Alptekin, allegedly lobbied American politicians for the extradition of the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Alptekin hasn't appeared in US court to face his charges.
When Flynn admitted to lying to federal investigators about his contact with the Russian ambassador as part of the special counsel probe into 2016 election interference, he also admitted to lying to the Department of Justice about the work he did with Kian in their consulting company. Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller's team and other prosecutors in December 2017. 
He has given them ""substantial assistance"" in criminal investigations, prosecutors have said. He has not yet been sentenced and continues to help prosecutors.
Kian's legal team also seeks documents from Flynn's lawyers at the law firm Covington &amp; Burling, which worked on the foreign lobbying submissions Flynn's company made retroactively to the Justice Department before he was charged. The law firm still defends Flynn in his criminal case.
A spokesman for Covington &amp; Burling declined to comment on Friday.","President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and Russia investigation cooperator Michael Flynn will be a ""principal witness"" in the upcoming trial of his former lobbying partner -- and his statements to special counsel Robert Mueller will matter …",2019-03-02T02:00:22Z,"Michael Flynn to be star witness in trial of his ex-lobbying partner, documents say",CNN,0
"CHEIA, Mozambique (Reuters) - Maria Jofresse cannot find her two young daughters’ graves, though she helped dig them herself.   
A single teardrop swells beneath each of her dark eyes as she recalls the moment the girls were snatched away by the fast-flowing floodwaters. 
It took four days to find their bodies, which were buried where Cyclone Idai had left them, far from where they lived. 
“I cannot recognize it anymore,” the 25-year-old mother said, drying her eyes with a patch of patterned skirt at a makeshift camp of blue tarpaulin, near the riverside village of Cheia. “I cannot find them.” 
On the night of the storm, Jofresse took shelter at her mother-in-law’s house with her husband and children, a 6-month-old baby and 4-year-old girl. 
The next day, the river beside the village broke its banks and water rushed in. The family fled, trying to reach the main road, which lies on higher ground.  
But the water was too quick. Afraid they’d drown, the family climbed into a single cashew tree. 
For 11 hours they clung to its branches, Jofresse cradling the baby while her husband held their eldest girl. 
At 10 pm, in total darkness, the flood ripped the tree’s roots from the soaked earth, throwing the family into the fast-flowing water and separating them.  
Jofresse survived by grabbing onto another tree. The next day, wading through the now largely stagnant water, she found her husband. Together they searched for the girls. 
On the morning of the fourth day, they found the body of their eldest, and in the afternoon, their lifeless baby. 
The children were among more than 800 people killed in the storm and the heavy rains before it struck Mozambique and two other southern African countries, Zimbabwe and Malawi. 
After digging two small graves, the couple joined other families at the camp set up just a few kilometers (miles) from their destroyed home. 
“We will stay here, because there’s nothing to go back to,” Jofresse said, sitting in a small square of shade at the camp. 
“You can come and live with me,” her father, Joao Jofresse Ngira, interjected, distraught at his daughter’s pain. 
Jofresse does not answer. 
It is not the first time she has lost a home. In 2000, when she was just 5, devastating floods destroyed her nearby village of Mashongo. 
The government moved the family to a new community, built for those with nowhere to go after that disaster. 
Ngira showed Reuters around the village, located by the River Muda. It became known as Cheia, or “Flood” in Portuguese - “because we were brought here from the water,” he explained. 
The spot was chosen because it was on higher ground and less prone to flooding. 
“It was meant to be safe,” he said, standing outside the ruins of the four-room house the government helped him build. Five young children played in the pile of broken bricks and cracked cement. 
Cheia’s fate shows how climate change is threatening places that just under two decades ago were considered safe. 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the catastrophe in Mozambique rings “yet another alarm bell” about the dangers of global warming, which scientists say will make devastating storms like Cyclone Idai more frequent. 
“Since this disaster, we haven’t seen anyone from the government, even though they’re the ones that put us here,” Ngira said. 
Asked if he would like to move somewhere else, he looks down at his muddy yellow trainers, before replying: “I don’t have any money. It’s best not to dream.” 
On the Sunday Reuters visited, the camp bustled with rumors that food would be delivered that afternoon. 
It had been a week since the last bit of aid arrived and people were hungry. Jofresse canceled a memorial service for her daughters because she feared the food might arrive while she was gone. 
When the aid finally comes, Jofresse unpacks the parcel in her blue tent. There is a set of nappies. 
She puts them to one side.

When my family moved from New York City to suburban New Jersey a year and a half ago, I was a girl with high-heeled boots, a useless MetroCard and a big chip on my shoulder. Sure, our new town was adjacent to a university, and offered many cultural options, cute coffee places and restaurants, but to me it was not home. I knew I would miss the ability to step out my door and just walk to wherever I was going. In Brooklyn, theres a certain energy in the streets people are out and about, and you never know who or what youll encounter just steps away from your door. Here in Princeton, the sidewalks seemed strangely quiet. Where are all the people? I wondered.
Another frustration was being car-less. In Brooklyn, our little beater was a luxury a way to escape the city for field trips to Stone Barns, Wave Hill or apple picking. In New Jersey, having two cars is pretty much the standard. Each day when my husband took the car to work, I felt like I was stranded in a lonely episode of the Jersey Shore. The cashier at the Rite Aid behind our house was quickly becoming my only connection with humanity. When I was with our then 6-year-old twins, we Ubered to after-school activities and even took cars to the mall when we needed a change of scenery. When my son got used to scoping out the random Toyota Camrys that would shuttle us to the local library, I knew this wasnt the best way for us to become part of our new community. Something had to change.
Then one morning after the kids went to school and my husband left for work, I stood outside the house for a moment and enjoyed the feeling of the sun beating down on my shoulders on what was an unseasonably warm fall day. Instead of heading to the gym that was within walking distance of our house, I laced up my sneakers, strapped on my fanny pack and took off running down my block.
Id been running for a few years as part of my regular exercise routine, mostly on a treadmill but sometimes around the loop of Prospect Park. That morning, as I headed in the direction of my sons school, I wasnt really sure where I was going, or who or what Id encounter on my run. After passing some familiar streets, I took a turn on a block Id never been down, making a mental note of how to get back home. There was something refreshing about traversing this new territory on foot. Inside an anonymous Uber, the air was stale and stifling. Out on the sidewalk, I noticed everything from the crisp leaves that crackled under my foot strike to the sound of trucks and lawn mowers (always with the lawn mowers out here!) and even the clean smell of morning dew as I passed a small tributary. I wanted to bottle that scent and make it into a Suave body wash. It felt really great to be outside.
It occurred to me that I wasnt alone out here at all I just hadnt gotten out into my community.
As I quickened my pace and began to feel the first beads of sweat, I noticed that there were, in fact, other people outside. I saw senior citizens walking their dogs, FedEx drivers delivering packages, and even other runners who I gave a small smile of solidarity to as we passed one another. It occurred to me that I wasnt alone out here at all I just hadnt gotten out into my community.
I soon found that taking my exercise routine outdoors was a great way to get to know my neighborhood. I marveled as I passed landmarked, historic homes and even a small house with a sign offering avant-garde art classes. It was clear that there was a lot more to my town than I could see out my front window. But more than that, it was putting me in a good mood.
Joanna Paterson, certified trainer and owner of Bodiesynergy Fitness who leads outdoor bootcamp classes, says there are many benefits to exercising outdoors including breathing fresh air, vitamin D exposure which can enhance your mood and the singular focus an outdoor workout can provide that reduces the tendency to overthink.
Sometimes an outdoor run may be the only moment in your day when you connect with the earth, feel the breeze, feel the outdoor temps and feel great about yourself, she says.
Because of my runs, I stopped talking and thinking about what I was missing and really started to embrace where I am right now.
Finding yourself outside in nature is one of the best things you can do to regulate your brain and body, and also find yourself feeling more connected to your surroundings, says Dr. Vanessa Lapointe, a registered psychologist and author of ""Discipline Without Damage."" Movement is hugely important to our physical and mental health, allowing for giant squirts of serotonin to flood our brains and have us feeling happier and more settled.
Dr. Lapointe also told me that getting out in nature would not just help with my own mental health and overall well-being, it would be beneficial to my kids, too. The research on neighborhoods and healthy child development suggests that feeling connected to and at home in ones neighborhood leads to better outcomes,"" she says. ""Its no wonder that an activity such as running in ones neighborhood can be a brilliant thing when adapting to huge changes.
After that day, I made it a point to take my workout outside whenever I could, even running in the rain one morning (which, if youve done it, you know can be oddly satisfying!). Now when I look out my front window of my house, I see that my community is actually pretty outdoorsy. There are always runners or cyclists passing by, and in fact, there are even a whole network of trails Ive just begun to explore.
Now, over a year into living here, I have my own car, a little yellow subcompact that I can take to the grocery store or the library or wherever else we need to go. But as freeing as it is to be able to just get up and go, theres still nothing that beats putting on my sneakers and running and like moving to a new town not always knowing where the next step will take me.

"NBA star Steph Curry told ESPN Wednesday he was ""joking"" earlier this week when he said he did not think humans had ever landed on the moon -- and he revealed he'd accept an invitation from NASA to visit lunar artifacts at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Curry kicked off the controversy earlier this week when he appeared on a podcast called ""Winging It"" with fellow NBA veterans Vince Carter and Kent Bazemore, as well as Curry's Golden State Warriors teammate Andre Iguodala. At one point in the free-flowing conversation, Curry asked the group: ""We ever been to the moon?"" After the others responded no, Curry said: ""They're going to come get us, I don't think so either. Sorry, I don't want to start conspiracies."" ""Obviously I was joking when I was talking on the podcast,"" Curry told ESPN, adding that his public silence was ""protesting how stupid it was that people actually took that quote and made it law as, 'Oh my God, he's a fake-moon-landing truther,' whatever you want to call it."" The comments quickly went viral and sparked a furor on social media, with many criticizing the two-time NBA MVP for doubting the moon landing. Curry did not comment publicly about his statements until Wednesday, intensifying the focus on him. NASA spokesman Allard Beutel publicly invited Curry to visit the Johnson Space Center in Houston, ""perhaps the next time the Warriors are in town to play the Rockets. ""We have hundreds of pounds of moon rocks stored there, and the Apollo mission control,"" Beutel said. ""During his visit, he can see firsthand what we did 50 years ago, as well as what we’re doing now to go back to the moon in the coming years, but this time to stay.""

""And hopefully people understand that education is power, informing yourself is power.

Small towns nd footing out West
HAMILTON, Mont. - As small towns elsewhere saw prosperity pass them by in favor of the big cities, something unusual happened to this rural hamlet tucked in the Bitterroot Valley: It flourished.
Two local boys came home from college and launched a microbrewery that takes in more than $1 million in annual sales. Retirees arrived in droves, drawn by affordable land and recreation opportunities in the area's snow-frosted mountains and trout-filled streams. And the federal government's Rocky Mountain Laboratories opened a state-of-the-art biosafety facility to investigate the deadliest viral diseases, including Ebola.
As U.S. economic growth in the past decade assumed an increasingly urban character, that diverse set of strengths enabled this town to defy a pervasive narrative of rural decline. Hamilton's population of 4,728 is up more than 10 percent since 2010, reflecting a Western renaissance that contrasts with the experience of small towns in other regions.
""It's a pretty sweet spot to be in,"" said economist Ray Rasker, of Headwaters Economics in Bozeman, Montana. ""You can have the same job you'd have in Seattle and go fly fishing in the afternoon. . . . It's the quality of life. It attracts talent. Pretty soon, talent builds on itself, and word gets out.""
Hamilton has parlayed distinctive attributes into population growth, including proximity to the state's second-largest city, majestic surroundings, a good supply of college graduates and a dependable base of federal government employment.
All of that makes Hamilton representative of a little-noticed trend. Western towns with fewer than 5,000 residents grew by an average of nearly 8 percent from 2010 to 2017, according to the Census Bureau, while similar-sized communities in the Northeast and Midwest shrank. Those in the South grew barely 1 percent.
""It is striking,"" said Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Rural towns are doing better in the West. Smaller towns are doing better in the West.""
Yet Hamilton offers no obvious formula for success that could be transplanted to the half-empty rural communities that have yet to fully recover from the Great Recession. Other communities could emphasize educating their workforce. But some advantages, including a largely recession-proof federal facility and stunning natural surroundings, aren't available everywhere. Hamilton's endurance instead only highlights the challenges confronting the nation's endangered small towns.
""Most places are on the wrong side of huge global and technological trends,"" said Muro, who is policy director for the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings.
Hamilton got its start in the late 19th century, thanks to Marcus Daly, an Irish copper baron who sought a summer home for his family and a reliable supply of lumber for his business.
Today, the big sawmills are mostly gone. The picturesque Main Street, bracketed by mountain views, is lined by two-story brick retail outlets. Nearly all the residents are white and conservative. In surrounding Ravalli County, Donald Trump in 2016 beat Hillary Clinton 66 percent to 28 percent.
Although some affluent retirees have arrived in recent years, this is not a wealthy rural enclave like Aspen, Colorado, or Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Hamilton's median household income is $30,000 annually, well below the state's $50,000 figure, though the gap is significantly narrower for married couples.
Among those joining the Hamilton influx were childhood friends Fenn Nelson and Jasper Miller, both 31, who returned here to open a brewery-and-restaurant after graduating from the University of Montana in Missoula. With a business degree, Nelson took charge of the books, while Miller put his microbiology diploma to use keeping the brewery in working order.
Employing used equipment - including some scavenged from an aircraft carrier - they leased a former natural foods emporium and converted it into Higherground Brewing.
Inside the low-slung building, the decor is spare: a checkerboard tile floor, stools and a few tables. On a recent night, a dozen customers watched a college basketball game on a television above the bar.
The beers on offer - including ""At Ease Golden Ale"" and ""Flash Flood Milk Stout"" - were listed on a chalkboard along with the daily food specials.
One of two breweries in town, Higherground posted $1 million in sales in its sixth year of operations and has been profitable for the past ""two to three years,"" Nelson said. About 40 percent of its output is sold elsewhere in the state.
They had considered locations in Idaho and California, but the men said the advantages of coming home were clear. A local banker, who had known them for years, approved a $162,000 loan that got them started. Miller's recently retired father pitched in on several projects, providing free labor that would not have been available if they had launched elsewhere. The young men also saved money by living with their parents.
Located an hour south of Missoula, a city of roughly 75,000 with an international airport, a major state university and a Walmart, Hamilton ""is in a great Goldilocks zone,"" Miller said. ""It's really accessible.""
Hamilton's relative outperformance - and that of Western towns, in general - comes amid the urbanization of American economic growth. Globalization and technology deeply eroded small towns' traditional manufacturing role while placing a premium on the skills of the educated digerati in the nation's largest cities.
The West has navigated these shifting economic tides better than other parts of the country. Since 2010, it has been by far the fastest-growing region in the country, according to the Census Bureau, expanding output two-thirds faster than the Midwest and more than twice as fast as the Northeast.
Based on measures of new-business formation, migration and job churn, Western states are significantly more dynamic than those in the East, said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington consulting firm.
""These are newer economies. They have fewer concrete cinder blocks to drag around behind them as they're trying to grow,"" he said. ""There's an unmistakable East-West divide.""
In much of the country, small towns were poorly equipped to capitalize on the new economy of globalized supply chains and high-technology services jobs. But Western towns such as Hamilton were never heavily dependent upon manufacturing. Lacking big factories that could be hollowed out by competition from China or automation, they escaped the big job losses that went with them.
Hamilton is home to a GlaxoSmithKline plant that produces a vaccine ingredient, but the town's manufacturing workforce as a share of total employment is one-third smaller than the national average, according to the Census Bureau.
In manufacturing-dependent communities, many workers abandoned school before getting a college degree, since good-paying jobs were available without one on the factory floor. Hamilton's federal lab, which employs about 450 workers and attracts skilled personnel from as far away as India, is a continuing reminder of the value of education.
The lab's 36-acre site has its roots in the late 19th century, when lumberjacks returned from the nearby woods with an unusual illness known as ""the black measles."" State officials established a modest outpost, which the federal government purchased in 1932, to investigate what was later identified as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Inside today's facility, some of the world's top scientists investigate nature's toughest challenges, scrutinizing tissue samples with sophisticated electron microscopes and conducting Ebola experiments while wearing full body biosafety suits. Research conducted here led to the first vaccine for Ebola, which was deployed in the West African outbreak several years ago.
Cathryn Haigh, 39, a specialist in rare neurodegenerative diseases, accepted a position at the lab in 2017, moving here from Melbourne, Australia. She grows ""mini-brains"" from stem cells, which allows her to study maladies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal degenerative brain disorder.
""I felt Melbourne was just a very anonymous city,"" said Haigh, who was raised in a village of 3,000 people in southwest England. ""You were very much lost as just another random person in a crowd. One of the things I love here is the sense of community, the human connection.""
People have remarked on the Bitterroot's natural beauty since 1805, when explorers Lewis and Clark passed through on their way to the Pacific Ocean. Hamilton abuts one of the largest wilderness areas in the country, home to hiking, skiing and fly fishing, and enjoys a mild climate that has earned the valley the sobriquet ""Montana's banana belt.""
The outdoors is more than a scenic backdrop. It's a pillar of the local economy.
Chuck Stranahan, a veteran fishing guide who put himself through college tying flies for a retailer, owns a fishing shop near Main Street. The former California school administrator sells hand-tied flies and charges $500 a day to guide anglers along the Bitterroot River or one of 13 nearby creeks.
The recreation industry plays an outsized role in determining the fate of places like Hamilton. In recent years, the recovery of a once-endangered fish, the west slope cutthroat trout, helped spur a surge in outdoor tourism. Some who come here as tourists later stay for good.
Marshall Bloom, associate director of the federal lab, says Hamilton's surroundings make recruiting top talent easy. Nationwide, since the recession's end, people have been more likely to move to counties with opportunities for outdoor activities than those without them, according to a January study by Headwaters Economics.
""Recreation may make the difference between gaining or losing population, particularly in rural counties,"" the study found.
At city hall, Mayor Dominic Farrenkopf, 40, seeks to balance growth and Hamilton's small-town appeal. As evidence of the latter, he notes that he and his wife, Hannah, were born in the same hospital, delivered by the same obstetrician and nurse.
He's pushing the city council to approve plans to attract light industry to a new economic development district near the Ravalli County Airport, while navigating simmering anti-growth sentiments.
The mayor, who moved back here in 2001 after four years in the U.S. Coast Guard, acknowledges that some of his neighbors ""don't want things to change"" but says he is optimistic about striking the proper balance.
""I don't see a massive expansion of population. I see a nice steady growth,"" Farrenkopf said. ""I wouldn't mind adding another 1,000 people to the city.""
But some local voices already have been raised against unbridled growth. A few years ago, talk of a possible Walmart superstore sparked opposition from residents concerned about potential traffic and the impact on local retailers. A group of homeowners last year sued the Federal Aviation Administration over its approval of a proposed runway extension at the airport east of town, a case that remains on appeal.
""When you say 'industry,' it conjures up images of brick buildings belching black smoke out of ugly stacks - and that's not what we're prepared to host here,"" said Stranahan, the fishing guide.
Mark Jergens, 71, who relocated to Hamilton after tiring of big cities such as Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle, says most people here ""don't want to 'Californicate' the place."" But gesturing at the traffic moving through town on a recent weekday, Jergens notes that the steady flow once was seen only during peak summer months.
The former emergency room physician, who now advises doctors facing malpractice lawsuits, has seen one small community ruined by too much of a good thing. Years ago, he and his wife, Mimi, lived in Gig Harbor, Wash. Today, that once-quaint waterfront town northwest of Tacoma has a population of more than 9,500, almost triple its 1990 size.
""I think that's what eventually will happen here,"" he said ruefully. ""More people will come.""","HAMILTON, Mont. - As small towns elsewhere saw prosperity pass them by in favor of the big cities, something unusual happened to this rural hamlet tucked in the Bitterroot Valley: It flourished.

"MADISON, W.Va. (AP) If you want to understand why U.S. life expectancy is declining, West Virginia is a good place to start. The state is a bellwether of bad health, portending major problems years before they became severe nationally. It seems that the worst outcomes happen here first, said Dr. Michael Brumage, a West Virginia University public health expert who formerly ran the health department in Charleston. Were the canary in the coal mine. The drug overdose death rate for all Americans today is where West Virginias rate was 10 years ago. The nations suicide rate is where West Virginias was nearly 20 years ago. Obesity was common in West Virginia before it became widespread in the rest of the country. And life expectancy started tumbling in the Mountain State before it began falling across the U.S. Maggie Hill has lived in the state for all of her 67 years. Sitting in her cabin in the town of Madison recently, she ticked off the many deaths that have befallen her family: An older brother drowned in a flood in 1977. A sister died in a house fire. Two siblings, both smokers, died of lung cancer. Two others were stillborn. Her first husband died of congestive heart failure. Then there were the suicides. Two of her three sons shot themselves to death, one of them after losing his job. Her second husband died the same way, using a gun in their bedroom closet one Sunday morning while she was still in bed. I dont think people have a lot to live for, she said. I really and truly dont see things getting better. LIFE EXPECTANCY After decades of steady increases, U.S. life expectancy has been declining since 2014. A government report released last month said the trend continued last year, driven in part by suicides and drug overdoses the so-called diseases of despair. What else is driving the decline? Experts say Americas obesity problem has worsened the diabetes death rate and helped stall progress against the nations leading killer, heart disease. West Virginia eclipses most other states in the percentage of people affected by diabetes, heart disease and obesity. It has had the nations highest rate of drug overdose deaths for years running. It also has the highest obesity rate and the highest rates of diabetes and high blood pressure. Adding to those woes is the highest suicide rate among states east of the Mississippi River. Earlier this fall, U.S. health officials released for the first time life expectancy predictions at a neighborhood level. An Associated Press analysis of the data found wide disparities in cities and towns. Among states, the AP found, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy. West Virginia was the second lowest, behind Mississippi. Mississippi, Oklahoma and a few other states suffer death and disease rates that are about as bad or sometimes worse. But those places have unusually large populations of low-income black or Native American people, who suffer a disproportionate share of disability, disease and death. West Virginia is 94 percent white. That makes it a telling indicator. Nearly 80 percent of the Americans who die each year are white people, and death rates rose in white men and women last year but were flat or falling in blacks and Hispanics. So white deaths particularly those of people who are not elderly are mainly responsible for the nations declining life expectancy. WIDESPREAD ATTENTION Ten years ago, The Associated Press described Huntington, West Virginia, and its environs as the unhealthiest place in America, based on health survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that put it at the bottom of the charts in more than a half-dozen measures, including the highest proportions of people who were obese, had diabetes and had heart disease. The AP report, and others like it, drew widespread attention that peaked in 2010, when celebrity chef Jamie Oliver staged a reality TV show in Huntington to teach people how to eat better. The attention was not entirely welcomed. It felt like outsiders coming in to criticize and perpetuate hillbilly stereotypes, said Steve Williams, who was elected Huntingtons mayor in 2012. But Williams said it also was motivating, prompting changes in school food and even improvements to parks and sidewalks. We get slammed all the time with obesity, said Andy Fischer, a financial adviser who organized a 2,500-person community walking program. Weve got to get better. These days, the Huntington area looks somewhat better in government health surveys. For example, the regions obesity rate is only a few percentage points above the national median instead of 10 or 20 points. That said, its clear the Huntington area still has some big problems. It ranks among the worst metro areas in measures like the percentage of adults who smoke, have high blood pressure and have had a stroke. OPIOIDS AND OBESITY About the time Huntington was trying to tackle its weight problem, it was rocked by a new crisis opioid addiction. West Virginia now has the distinction of having the nations highest drug overdose death rate. Last year, for the first time, the states body count surpassed 1,000. The epidemic also produced ripple effects such as a spike in the number of children taken into foster care because of dead or addicted parents. In the last two years, no West Virginia county has seen more overdose deaths than Cabell County, which includes Huntington. One of the grimmest spots has been Huntingtons West End some locals call it the Worst End. The AP analysis of neighborhood-level death data found the area had a life expectancy at birth of only 62 years, 16 years shorter than national life expectancy. Huntingtons reputation crystalized on a chaotic Monday in August 2016, when emergency responders saw 28 overdoses over six hours including two deaths. The city soon became known as Americas overdose capital. As documentary crews descended, Huntington tried to confront the problem. Among the efforts were quick-response teams charged with finding people days after they were treated for an overdose. The teams include a police officer, a clergy member, a paramedic and a treatment counselor who hand out overdose-reversing naloxone and provide information about treatment. They also direct people to a needle-exchange program run by the Cabell-Huntington Health Department. One of the key figures in the program is Thommy Hill, a former drug dealer who has become its gatekeeper and central cog. He knows every drug user who visits and constantly tries to persuade them to try treatment arranging immediate transportation and handing them a backpack full of clothes if they agree. One morning in late October, bantering with a man who had come in for fresh needles, Hill lit up when the visitor mentioned a past vacation. Hill pitched him a one-week stay at a treatment hospital, joking that people will wait on you hand and foot. A few minutes later, he explained: Its all about treating them like people. They dont get a lot of that. Something seems to be working. Non-fatal overdoses in Huntington have fallen and are on track to be 40 percent lower than 2017, city officials said. They are optimistic deaths will be down this year, too. If we can turn around overdose numbers here, we can do it anywhere, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in May at a health summit in Huntington. Politicians including President Donald Trump have decried the opioid epidemic, prioritizing it over other health crises. But obesity still presents a towering threat. West Virginians exercise less than other Americans. They eat fruits and vegetables less often. Only Mississippi has a larger proportion of adults drinking soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages each day. In some cases, state policies are not helping. For example, bariatric surgery can help certain obese people for whom conventional diet and exercise programs have no lasting effect. But West Virginias Medicaid program has unusually harsh cost-control barriers that make it difficult for severely obese people to get approved for surgery, according to a recent analysis by George Washington University. Then theres the soda tax, which health advocates say can give consumers second thoughts about choosing those drinks. Last year, Gov. Jim Justice proposed raising it from 1 cent per 16.9-ounce bottle to a penny per ounce. It failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature. SIGNS OF CHANGE There are some signs of hope in West Virginia. In October, health advocates held a conference on obesity in the South in West Virginias capital city. It was a surprisingly upbeat meeting. The South has long had the highest obesity rates in the country, and nowhere has adult obesity been more common than in West Virginia. But future-focused projects are popping up all over the state, aimed at getting kids to embrace exercise and healthy eating. We want to give people hope that we can be knocked off the unhealthiest list of states, said Kayla Wright, director of an organization called Try This West Virginia thats funding many of them. One grant paid for high school students to build a 5K trail and explore creating a teen cross-country running group. Another grant went toward restoring a greenhouse and helping people learn to garden. Many of the projects are baby steps, but conference participants cited a few places where progress seems broader. Huntington is one, they say. Another is Mingo County, in the southwest corner of the state, deep in the heart of coal country. Life expectancy there has never been high. Jobs in the lumber and coal industries were notoriously dangerous. Doctors could be hard to find. And there was violence: The deadly Hatfield-McCoy feud played out in those hills, as did bloody labor battles between miners and coal companies. The largest municipality in the county, Williamson, became known in the last decade as a center for the abuse of prescription opioid painkillers. (Some called the 3,000-person town Pilliamson.) But while the drug crisis was playing out, some local leaders led by a young doctor named C. Donovan Dino Beckett built a series of programs aimed at creating a culture of health. It started seven years ago with the opening of a free clinic that later became the Williams Health and Wellness Center. That spawned a community garden and a vegetable delivery service, a running club and once-a-month 5K races that draw a few hundred runners. Also in the works, for next year, is a federally funded treatment program for people addicted to drugs. So far, perhaps the most successful program is one that sends health workers to the homes of diabetics. Jamie Muncy is one success story. The 48-year-old lost his job three years ago when the mine he was working in shut down. Last fall, he had just pulled out of a long-term habit of pain pills and other drugs when he bizarrely tore a tendon in his foot while picking up a piece of paper at a post office. It was so painful he rarely walked, but he continued to eat terribly. Out of a job and with his marriage in ruins, I had no motivation to be healthy, he said. I didnt care. By January, the 5-foot-3 former mine foreman ballooned from 165 pounds to 196. I was round as I was tall, he said. A visit to the Williamson health center revealed he had alarming, diabetes-qualifying blood sugar levels. Hed had mini-strokes in the past, and his physician said a much bigger one was probably on its way if Muncy did not take drastic steps. The doctor put him on a tight carb-cutting diet, connected him to physical therapy and put him in the home-visit diabetes program. Now Muncy walks 5 miles a day and is a regular at the farmers market. His weight is down to about 145 pounds, he said in a recent interview. He still smokes, though. AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE University of Washington researchers recently calculated something called healthy life expectancy the period someone born today could expect to live in relative health. West Virginia, at 62½ years, was the lowest among states. Clearly, health problems abound. Black lung disease rates and coal mine injury rates appear to be up. West Virginia has been at the top of the charts in hepatitis B and C infection rates. Adding to that, the state saw an HIV outbreak last year, and it is still weathering a hepatitis A outbreak both associated with injection drug users Maggie Hill, the lifelong West Virginian, has little hope for the future. But she does have Charity. Charity is a 10-year-old girl Hill adopted about five years ago. Hills son had been raising her but lost custody during his ongoing struggle with drug addiction, Hill said. Hill and Charity live in a small wooded valley with a creek in it a holler, as they say in West Virginia. Her house is a cabin that from the outside resembles a small, tidy barn. Charity has given her life a purpose, she said. I taught her how to survive when Im gone, she said. I have to. Shes going to need to know how to cook.... She needs to know how to keep house. She needs to know how to mow grass, so if she aint got a man, she can keep the yard clean. I teach her every bit of this. Charity is a good student (Four As and a B on her last report card, Hill said). And theres hope that she will do well enough to go to college. Hill is saving for it. She wants to be a doctor, Hill said. If Charity does go to college, some place away from Boone County, Hill says she will move there with her. If Im alive, she said. ___ AP data journalist Nicky Forster contributed from New York. ___ The Associated Press Health &amp; Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has decided it cannot authorize new flood insurance policies, citing the partial shutdown of the federal government due to a budget impasse in Congress and potentially putting thousands of home sales in limbo. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees a federal program that insures about 5 million homes and businesses, on Wednesday posted a notice on its website that the program will not be able to “issue new contracts for flood insurance during a lapse in authority unless Congress passes legislation.” 
The National Association of Realtors estimated the decision could disrupt up to 40,000 home sales each month. 
FEMA said that during the shutdown, the government-backed National Flood Insurance Program will continue to pay all claims on policies taken out before midnight on Dec. 21. 
The federal government has been partially shut down since Saturday because of an impasse over President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion in taxpayer funding for a proposed Mexican border wall. Last week Trump said his administration was prepared for a lengthy shutdown.

"MINNEAPOLIS Forty years and about two weeks ago, they played a storied closing Monday night in Salt Lake City, at a venue charmingly titled Special Events Center. It came to serve as one of the starriest crests in the history of college basketball. It featured Michigan State with Magic Johnson winning, 75-64, over Indiana State with Larry Bird.
Its attendance: 15,410.
Forty years and about two weeks on, they will play the first NCAA mens basketball tournament championship game in all the closing Mondays ever since to feature two programs debuting on the elevated stage. Yet this matter will bring something far less starry: When Virginia (34-3) opposes Texas Tech (31-6), it could serve as juicy mostly for connoisseurs of the beautiful ugliness of defense. Suffocation (Texas Tech) will oppose strangulation (Virginia).
The expected attendance: Oh, about 72,000.
Somehow, after 39 final Mondays with 78 spots so heavily hoarded by Dukes (nine appearances in the title game in that span), North Carolinas (seven), Kentuckys (five), Kansases (five), Michigans (five) and Connecticuts (four), not to mention seven more schools with three berths each, the final has found itself some freshness and otherness. In that process, it also has found the promise of bruises.
Virginia guard Kihei Clark expects a grinder of a game. Texas Techs Brandone Francis said Sunday, I love eating ice cream, and it is no different than playing defense, a novel concept in a world that does not typically equate the two. Virginias Mamadi Diakite said, We have to make sure we hit them with a lot of screens. Texas Techs Norense Odiase referred to assistant Mark Adams as sort of the teams defensive coordinator, thereby introducing apt football terminology. Virginias Jack Salt said, They flood, they go for the ball, and they scrap, so its going to be a battle tomorrow.
[A year after historic upset, Tony Bennett and Virginia see things turning their way]
Even the statistics grind against each other like grotesqueries on a dance floor. In adjusted defensive efficiency according to KenPom.com, Virginia stands fifth, Texas Tech first. In adjusted offensive efficiency, Virginia stands third, Texas Tech 28th, also a lofty ranking given the 353 participants in the sport. Texas Tech would be the 237th-fastest-playing team in the country. Virginia would be 353rd.
Texas Tech springs a lot of turnovers, such as Odiases remarkable steal from Michigan States Xavier Tillman with 82 seconds to go Saturday night, when Odiase simply ripped the damned ball from Tillmans hands. Brandon Clarke of Gonzaga, one of the litany of extremely good teams felled by Texas Tech this tournament, coined a word and the Red Raiders really, really handsy. At 15.7 forced turnovers per game, Texas Techs defense stands 22nd in the land.
At 8.9 turnovers committed per game, Virginias offense stands at No. 1.
[Texas Tech rolls after a veins popping pep talk from Patrick Mahomes]
Theres so much chatter about defense around here that Chris Beard, the remarkable third-year Texas Tech coach, got his feelings a tad wounded, justly. It seems nobody has noticed his teams improved offense. Somebody here ought to take a look at our offense the last 30 to 50 days of the season, he said. Its all related. But no problem on the defense.
So he talked some defense. In the talk of defense, every actor in this rugged theater seemed to agree that Virginias defense differs from Texas Techs defense. They do a good job of keeping the ball in front of them, controlling the pace of the game, not letting a lot of things get into the paint, Odiase said. We do a good job of keeping teams on the side, frustrating them, getting them out of their actions. I dont know if thats similar or not, but we do a good job of taking opponents out of what they want to do.
Virginias pack-line defense doesnt look all that much like a storm. It tries to keep you from thinking you can go messing around down low, while keeping you taking improbable shots from up high. Texas Techs swarming defense tries to force you to the sideline. It tries to make you feel youre not welcome in the middle of the court. It tries to make you feel outcast and lonely and sad.
Given that Buffalo averaged 85 points and got 58 against Texas Tech; Michigan averaged 70 and got 44; Gonzaga averaged 88 and got 69; and Michigan State averaged 78 and got 51; and given that Oklahoma averaged almost 72 points and got 51 against Virginia; Oregon averaged 70 and got 49; Purdue averaged 76 and got 70 in regulation because Carsen Edwards made superhuman shots; and Auburn averaged almost 80 and got 62, there has been so much sadness this early spring.
First, defensively, Texas Tech no, theyre different from us, 10th-year Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. Theyre really special defensively. I have the utmost respect for how they play, but it is a different system. ... Theyre very physical. Their ability to take your ball, and just look at the games in the tournament, and what theyve done to some of the great offensive teams has been so impressive.
When you try to play hard defense, you understand the value of offensively how mentally tough you have to be, how sound you have to be, and you have to take what the defense gives you. But its a challenge. When our defense is at its best, it really makes people work to get contested shots. Obviously, Texas Tech, in their own way, they make people work, and they swarm. So understanding that and not just saying, Oh, they havent seen our offense. . . . That would be false confidence. But understand and, hey, it takes hard, tough offense, and you work to get some quality shots, and then you turn around and play the same way against them.
Said Beard: We have interchangeable parts. We dont have guys who are ones, twos, threes, fours, fives defensively. We have players. . . . I ask recruits all the time, What was Michael Jordan? Was he a two? No. One?' In my opinion, he was the best post player in basketball with his back to the basket in his career. LeBron [James], what is he? Hes a player. I think defensively we have a lot of players. Were not in much position. This allows us to switch and guard different people and stuff like that. 
Following upon a 13-3 Super Bowl only an X-and-O connoisseur could relish, here comes a Magic-less, Larry-less national title game that might end up needing its defenders of the concept of defense. Its just pride, Odiase said of the art. Its, like, in the park, one-on-one against the guy. The amount of pride, indeed, might exceed the amount of points.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has not and will not change its prudent monetary policy and will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus, Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday. 
Market speculation is growing over whether authorities will take more aggressive policy steps after recent weak data. 
“I reiterate that the prudent monetary policy has not changed and will not change. We are determined not to engage in ‘flood-like’ stimulus,” Li said at a cabinet meeting, according to a statement on the government’s website. 
A cut in banks’ reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in January reflected ample room for such reductions, Li said. 
China slashed RRR by 100 basis points in January - its fifth cut in the past year - as it looks to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy. Further reductions are widely expected. 
China’s banks doled out a record 3.23 trillion yuan ($480.43 billion) in new loans in January while several other key credit gauges also picked up modestly that month in response to recent policy easing steps. 
Rising bill financing and short-term loans could lead to “arbitrage” activities and create potential risks, he added. 
Financial institutions should offer more credit, especially medium- and long-term loans to small firms, he said. 
Li also said the government needed to deepen reform to resolve long-term problems in the economy.

"LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In Frankfurt and Paris, the flood of banking jobs predicted to arrive after Brexit is, for now, little more than a trickle. 
An analysis of job postings on eight of the world’s major investment bank websites show a modest push to recruit staff in other European cities but little to suggest London is set for a rapid demise as the region’s top banking hub. 
Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are seeking to fill 1,545 new roles in Britain, numbers up to January 22 show. 
In Germany and France - the two countries predicted to see the biggest influx of financial services from Britain as a result of Brexit - just 301 roles have been listed. 
Only Deutsche Bank is looking to hire more people in Germany than in Britain, with 133 German vacancies posted online compared to 132 in the UK. 
“It isn’t really a tsunami of hires,” said Christine Kuhl, a partner with executive placement firm Odgers Berndtson in Frankfurt. 
The figures do not capture numbers of existing employees who might relocate from London to other EU offices under contingency plans following Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) or roles that are not publicly advertised. 
But they are forward-looking indicators of how each bank is looking to remodel their European workforce over the coming months in the face of Brexit, and suggest banks are only making modest tweaks as Britain’s EU departure approaches on March 29. 
“Culturally, Paris is French, Frankfurt is German but London is international. The Americans - who own this industry - want to operate in an English speaking environment. No one wants to go,” said Martin Armstrong, partner at headhunting firm Armstrong International. 
Other recruitment specialists reported few signs of banks preparing to bulk up in a hurry, even if Britain has to leave the EU without a deal covering financial services. 
The small number of moves to date have followed many months of consultations and negotiations, the headhunters said, with banks keen to avoid relocations which might prove premature or even unnecessary. 
“It can be done, but we are talking months, possibly longer if there are families involved,” said James Murray, a director at search firm Robert Walters. 
“That said, if risk takers do start to move elsewhere than that is where we could start to see real movement in terms of jobs. When the risk takers move, then surely the risk managers move, and so on,” he added. 
HOMEWORK 
Search firm Korn Ferry set up a Brexit task force after Britons voted in 2016 to leave the EU and met regularly to prepare for a mass transfer of talent from London to Frankfurt. But the influx hasn’t happened. 
One senior banker who is making the move to Frankfurt is Christoph Seibel. Seibel, a German national, left the city in 1993 to go to business school in the United States and then pursue a career in London. 
Mizuho poached him from RBC Capital Markets in London to become CEO of the bank’s newly headquartered EU operations in Frankfurt. He takes up the new post on March 28. 
Mizuho is one of 45 financial firms that Germany’s financial regulator Bafin says are setting up Frankfurt hubs after Brexit. 
But moves like Seibel’s are few and far between, with activity to date well short of the 6,000 financial jobs lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance previously expected to move to Germany’s largest financial hub in the event of a hard Brexit. 
Seven leading executive search firms contacted by Reuters reported few offerings for leadership roles in Frankfurt as uncertainty about Britain’s future trading relationship with the bloc continues. 
Some banks are nevertheless betting on London to retain the balance of power over rival centres in the EU, opting to base top executives and keep their European headquarters in London - for the time being at least. 
Citi’s new EMEA Chief Executive David Livingstone will be based in the UK capital, as will HSBC’s newly appointed global markets boss Georges Elhedery, who will relocate from Dubai to London to take up the job two weeks before Brexit. 
Goldman Sachs has recently expanded the role of London-based Richard Gnodde to head of the bank’s international operations while Morgan Stanley has appointed Clare Woodman to head up its EMEA business - also from London. 
FAST-TRACK 
For now at least, head hunters say London is winning the war to retain its talent, undermining Germany’s ‘Bankfurt’ ambitions or President Emmanuel Macron’s push to swell the Paris finance industry at London’s expense. 
Goldman Sachs for example, which is making Frankfurt its EU hub after Brexit, is looking for just 15 roles in Germany’s financial centre with most of them in compliance, tax, legal, risk management or operations. 
By contrast, the bank has 190 jobs advertised in Britain including I.T., compliance, human resources, as well as corporate &amp; investment banking roles. 
And with the market for permanent roles seen in rude health, persuading London-based bankers to move is no easy task, with handsome pay packages and better promotion prospects central to the negotiations. 
“People say: ‘talk to me about jobs in Asia first, then Dublin, then Frankfurt, then Paris’ in that order. People want big upticks and guaranteed bonuses as standard,” Darren Burns, operations director at headhunter Morgan McKinley, said. 
“There’s a feeling if you move to Dublin as a director now, you could be managing director in three years, whereas in Frankfurt, there is already too much competition for the top roles. The local talent is already your boss or your boss’s boss.” 
As banks automate more processes to cut costs, they are also recruiting more in countries where they can hire skilled workers in areas such as technology and risk management at a fraction of the cost seen in Western financial centres. 
After Britain, the second hottest jobs market in Europe is Poland, where 878 posts are up for grabs across Warsaw, Krakow and Wroclaw. 
Citi and Credit Suisse have advertised 531 roles in Poland between them, compared with an aggregated 36 posts in Germany and 8 jobs in France. 
Morgan Stanley has 49 vacancies in Budapest, where it opened in 2006 and now employs more than 1,300 people. 
“The biggest banks have been nearshoring and offshoring roles from their most expensive centres for the best part of 15 years now, entirely unrelated to Brexit,” Murray said. 
“If they still have jobs in London, it’s because they genuinely need or want those jobs to be in London.”

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - As Indonesia struggles with mountains of plastic waste going into landfill and polluting its rivers and oceans, business groups are pushing to overturn restrictions on importing plastic scrap into Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. 
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, is estimated to be the world’s second-largest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans after China, according to a 2015 study published in Science journal. 
To tackle this, the government last year pledged up to $1 billion a year to reduce marine plastic debris by 70 percent by 2025. 
But emerging divisions in the government on the issue of waste pose a fresh challenge to these targets. Partly driving this rift is a push by the plastics industry to overturn a halt in scrap imports, which was introduced in June on concerns about a flood of waste from western countries arriving after China barred such imports. 
Industry minister Airlangga Hartarto last month sent a letter urging the environment ministry to lift its bar on imports because Indonesia does not currently produce enough suitable plastic waste to feed its recycling industry. 
In the letter, reviewed by Reuters, Hartarto argued Indonesia needs 600,000 tonnes of imported scrap a year, much bigger than its usual 110,000 tonnes. He said the country enjoyed about a $40 million trade surplus by exporting recycled plastics. 
“This is a potential industry that creates a lot of jobs,” said Taufiek Bawazier, director of downstream chemical industry at the industry ministry, cautioning that focusing only on the environmental risks could harm the industry. 
“WE MUST NOT HATE PLASTIC” 
According to the 2015 Science journal report, almost half of the 3.2 million tonnes of plastic waste Indonesia produces in a year ends up in the sea. 
The issue was graphically highlighted in November when a sperm whale was found dead with 6 kg of plastic waste in its stomach on an Indonesian beach. 
But the government’s waste reduction targets are complicated by a lack of recycling culture or awareness of environmental damage in the developing country of 260 million people. 
Poor waste management means plastic trash that goes to landfills is too dirty to feed Indonesia’s recycling industry, Bawazier said, adding that business would take more than the annual 1.1 million tonnes of local scrap if it was available. 
Plastics lobby groups say downstream to upstream plastic industries employ 130,000 directly, while millions make a livelihood by scavenging for waste like plastic bottles for a small bit of cash. 
“We must not hate plastic,” said Christine Halim, chairwoman of Indonesia’s recycling association, noting that buying foreign scrap was much cheaper than making products with virgin plastic and, as long as the environment was protected, should be seen as a business opportunity. 
Safri Burhanuddin, deputy Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs, which overseas the environment ministry, said there were no plans to reopen scrap imports. 
Nonetheless, the industry ministry argues there is no legal basis to stop imports, while the plastic industry has successfully lobbied policymakers before. 
A 2016 plan to slap excise on all plastic packaging was watered down to only apply to plastic bags and even this has not been implemented yet. 
The industry is currently also fighting a ban on plastic bags in supermarkets by some city governments. The Indonesia Olefin, Aromatic and Plastic Industry Association was cited in media saying the move had led to an oversupply of bags. 
Burhanuddin of the maritime affairs ministry, however, applauded local action on waste management, pledging to award the best regional performers and shame laggards on social media. 
Tiza Mafira, director of the Indonesia Plastic Bags Diet Movement, a group pushing to cut use of plastic, said it was a “ridiculous idea” to import waste. 
“It is proven that we cannot handle plastic trash. It will end up in the landfill,” she said.

"PERU, Neb. (Reuters) - When Jim and Rose Downing heard forecasts last week for dangerously high water in their Nebraska hometown on the Missouri River, they were nonplussed since their house had not flooded in 100 years. 
Rose is the third generation of her family to reside in the brick home in the Gunnysack Flats neighborhood near downtown Peru, Nebraska, and 2 miles west of a levee that townspeople said never faltered in the past. 
This time was different, as the fewer than 1,000 residents of Peru discovered on Saturday when numerous Missouri River levees were breached due to heavy rainfall and snow melt. This included the earthen barrier near Peru, about 60 miles south of Omaha, the Army Corps of Engineers said. 
“We had only about 40 minutes” to evacuate, Rose, 57, recalled. They scrambled when water began to infiltrate about an eighth of a mile from the house. 
“My husband was saying, ‘Get out of here, get out of here.’ As we were backing out of the driveway, the water was coming up the driveway,” she said. 
In the scramble, the Downings managed to grab their cat, Gunk, as well as a few clothes, a television set, a curio cabinet, bedding and their medicines. But their most of their furniture and appliances remain in the house, surrounded by water.  
Parts of Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri have been inundated since late last week with floods that followed a powerful winter hurricane that slammed into America’s Farm Belt. 
The deluge has killed livestock, destroyed grains and soybeans in storage and cut off access to farms due to road and rail damage. At least four people have been killed in the region as a result of the flooding. 
Brett Adams, 39, a soybean and corn farmer who has a couple thousand acres on both sides of the river - which forms Nebraska’s border with Missouri - said he wasn’t too worried by the initial forecasts, either. 
“The prediction that high water was coming wasn’t too concerning,” Adams said. “We’ve never had water go over the levee. But two days later, we learned the river was going to rise 15 feet and it was full panic attack.” 
Adams began moving his farm machinery to higher ground. 
But the Downings still felt their own house was safe. Instead of making preparations, they said they helped Adams and other neighbors who lived closer to the levee move their possessions. 
“We were helping everybody else because we didn’t think it was going to get us,” said Rose, who works at the local Casey’s convenience store. Her husband works in a truck stop across the river in Missouri. 
Adams, a fourth-generation farmer, won’t have any crops this season. The Downings are now staying with friends in an apartment near Peru State College. They did not have flood insurance. 
“I’m mentally, physically, running off adrenaline,” said Rose, as tears pooled in her eyes. “It’s hard. It’s hard to start over at this age.”

"BEIRA, Mozambique (Reuters) - Rescue workers extended their search in Mozambique on Thursday for survivors of devastating floods following a powerful cyclone that ripped through southern Africa a week ago, killing hundreds and destroying buildings and farmland. 
The death toll in Mozambique has risen to 217 and around 15,000 people, many of them very ill, still need to be rescued, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said, though rescue workers continue to find bodies and the toll could rise sharply. 
Connor Hartnady, leader of a South African rescue operations task force, said a key priority for Thursday was to push into remaining areas affected by the flooding that had not yet been explored in search of people needing rescue. 
Helicopters were ferrying people, some plucked from the roofs of buildings and tree-tops, to the port city of Beira, the main headquarters for the huge rescue operation. 
One helicopter returned with four children and two women, rescued from a small football stadium in an otherwise submerged village. One young child, with a broken leg, was alone, and hung limp from exhaustion as rescuers laid him on the grass before moving him on to an ambulance. 
An elderly lady sat, dazed, nearby with two of her grandchildren. All three were unharmed, but the children had lost their mother. 
But with flood waters starting to recede, the priority now is to deliver food and other supplies to people on the ground rather than take people out of the affected areas, although that is also still happening, Correia said. 
Some 3,000 people have so far been rescued, said Correia. 
RACE AGAINST TIME 
“Our biggest fight is against the clock,” he told a news conference, adding that authorities were using all means possible to save lives and were working 24 hours per day. 
Cyclone Idai lashed the Mozambican port city of Beira with winds of up to 170 km per hour (105 miles per hour) a week ago, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions at risk. 
The death toll in neighbouring Zimbabwe rose to at least 100 on Thursday after two more bodies were discovered in the Chimanimani district, the worst hit by the cyclone. An estimated 56 people have been killed in Malawi. 
The United Nations Food Programme stepped up airdrops of high-energy biscuits to isolated pockets of people stranded by the floodwaters and delivered food parcels to displaced families sheltering in schools and other public buildings in the town of Dondo, 45 km (30 miles) northeast of Beira.

Beira, a low-lying city of 500,000 people, is home to Mozambique’s second-largest port and serves as a gateway to landlocked countries in the region. 
Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi, who declared three days of national mourning starting on Wednesday, has said the eventual death toll from the cyclone and ensuing floods could rise to more than 1,000. 
Mozambique’s tiny $13 billion economy is still recovering from a currency collapse and debt default.

"A storm system crossing the country dropped more than 4 inches of rain in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Thursday and snow in parts of Abilene, Texas. As the storm moves east, numerous states from Texas to Maryland are under flood, wind and even snow alerts. The storm is centered over Texas on Friday morning, but the heavy rain ahead of it is already spreading into the Carolinas. Heavy rain is falling in the South on Friday, stretching all the way to the Carolinas. By this evening, severe storms are possible across northern Florida and southern Georgia where damaging winds and a few tornadoes are possible. Flash flooding cannot be ruled out from Tallahassee, Florida, to South Carolina and North Carolina, including the inland areas that got the heavy snow last weekend. The storm will bring heavy rain into the Southeast on Friday evening. The heavy rain will move into the mid-Atlantic and part of the Northeast from Friday night into Saturday morning with some flooding possible near Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. The storm will move up the East Coast through the day on Saturday. By Sunday, the main center of the storm system will move into the Northeast with more heavy rain and even snow to the north. Rain will move into New England, as well as snow inland, on Sunday. Some areas in the Southeast could see 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized 5 inches of rain possible in northern Florida. Due to very saturated ground and the snowpack in the Southeast, flash flooding and river flooding is expected. Some of the river flooding could reach major flood stage this weekend.

"A large, powerful storm will charge through the Washington region late Thursday into Friday, bringing a threat of torrential rain and high winds.
Pockets of flooding are possible, and there is a risk of downed trees and power outages.
The storm, set to form over the Gulf of Mexico late Wednesday into Thursday, may challenge records for its intensity and the amount of moisture it draws northward at this time of year.
The National Weather Service has already posted a flood watch for the Washington region Thursday evening into Friday afternoon. Widespread rain amounts of one to two inches are predicted, but pockets of up to three to four inches are possible.
This is the 25th flood or flash flood watch issued for the Washington region during this record-wet year.
The heaviest rain is probable Thursday night, and may be accompanied by wind gusts increasing to 40 to 50 mph. An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out given spin in the atmosphere.
Soils are saturated and waterways are full after the weekends record-setting rain event, so it wont take much rain to cause flooding.
Should wind gusts over 40 mph materialize, downed trees and power outages are a risk. Given soils that are like pancake mix from all of the rain, trees are not well-rooted to the ground.
The rain
The storm system will tap moisture from deep in the Caribbean, and it will be focused in a narrow plume known as an atmospheric river surging up the East Coast. Like a fire hose, it will douse the Washington region with heavy rain.
The projected amount of moisture streaming into the region is projected to be two to four standard deviations above normal and could be record-setting for late December.
Rain will develop Thursday afternoon and may be heavy during the evening and overnight.
The National Weather Service projects 1.4 inches of rain in the region through Friday, the bulk of it falling Thursday night.
A dry slot may follow the main slug of rain Friday morning (as it turns unseasonably mild...60 degrees or higher), before a possible closing round of gusty showers Friday afternoon and evening.
Here are total storm rainfall projections from different models:
American (GFS) model: 1.1 inches
NAM model: 1.0 inches
High-resolution NAM model: 1.7 inches
Canadian: 1.5 inches
European: 1.25 to 1.5 inches
Because of the chance of localized downpours and thunderstorms embedded within bands of rain on Thursday night, amounts could vary substantially over small distances.
This rain will add to record-setting annual totals established in 2018 in both Washington and Baltimore. Washington has seen 64.22 inches (previous record: 61.33 inches from 1889) and Baltimore 68.82 inches (previous record: 62.66 inches from 2003).
The rain from this event could push Dulles to its wettest year on record. This year it has picked up 64.36 inches of rain, a little more than an inch behind 2003s 65.67 inches.
Severe storm and wind potential
This is a very dynamic storm. Its pressure may be near the lowest on record to pass through the D.C. area for this time of year. The lower the pressure in a storm, the more intense it is.
As the strengthening storm approaches the region Thursday night, we may see a rather sudden increase in wind speed, with gusts reaching 40 to 50 mph.
Because of the regions proximity to the low pressure center and resulting spin in the atmosphere, we cannot rule out thunderstorms and an isolated tornado in the bands of rain coming through Thursday night.
A strong warm front will be coming through, potentially pushing temperatures into the 50s to near 60 overnight. While thunderstorms at night in December are rare, we cannot rule them out given this volatile environment.
Gusty winds are possible on Friday as well, although models forecast their intensity to ease slightly (to 20 to 30 mph) compared with Thursday night.

Hundreds of Venezuelans gathered in downtown Barcelona, Spain, on Saturday to express their support for Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president of Venezuela last week.
The gathering was one of several expected around the world to coincide with a rally planned by Guaido in Venezuela.
The defiant socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro has called on its own loyalists to flood the streets waving flags to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Bolivarian revolution launched by the late Hugo Chavez.
Nancy San Juan, a 78-year-old yoga teacher, says: ""This is the end. It's imminent. How is it going to end? We don't know. We don't know because this man (Maduro) doesn't want to leave and is very defiant.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major disaster relief bill stalled on Monday in the U.S. Congress amid a political debate over aid for Puerto Rico, with President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans resisting Democrats’ insistence the island receive additional assistance. 
The Republican-controlled Senate took two procedural votes on Monday that both failed. The first was on a Republican bill offering $13.5 billion in disaster relief for states that included $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico. 
The second was on a $14.2 billion bill, with additional assistance for the U.S. island territory, passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in January, before severe flooding hit the U.S. Midwest. 
The failure of both bills sends lawmakers back to the negotiating table as the Trump administration’s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017, receives increased scrutiny, including from more than a dozen Democrats vying to take on the president in the 2020 elections. 
Republicans are poised to attack those Democratic candidates for holding up emergency aid to flood-hit states, including Iowa, which is the first state to hold its presidential nominating contest every four years. 
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló, a Democrat, said over the weekend that while the nutrition assistance in the Senate bill would be “vital to the well being of our citizens,” it still “falls short” of what is needed on the island of more than 3 million that has struggled to rebuild after the hurricane. 
Trump has repeatedly accused Puerto Rico and its leaders, including Rosselló and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, a vocal Trump critic, of mismanaging recovery funds and said the island should not receive additional assistance. 
“Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being,” Trump told reporters last week. “They don’t know how to spend the money and they’re not spending it wisely.” 
Rosselló has insisted the island is only asking for the same help given to U.S. states and repeatedly sought a meeting with the president, but his efforts have been rebuffed. Rosselló said in a recent CNN interview that Puerto Rico had struggled to obtain billions of dollars in assistance from the Trump administration that was already approved by Congress. 
The island is navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt when it declared bankruptcy in May 2017 after more than a decade of recession. 
‘PETTY GRUDGES’ 
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who has authored an alternative disaster assistance bill, accused the president of picking “winners and losers.” 
“Instead of standing with our neighbors, our fellow Americans, the president has chosen to hold petty grudges that are way beneath the office of the presidency,” Leahy said on the Senate floor. 
The topic of Puerto Rico and its recovery from Hurricane Maria surfaced repeatedly at a Monday forum of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates organized by labor unions and other liberal groups. 
Although Puerto Rico nationals are U.S. citizens and send a non-voting resident commissioner to the House, they are prohibited from voting in general presidential elections. But they can cast ballots in the nominating contests starting early next year. 
Julián Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, told the forum of his decision to kick off his campaign by visiting the island: “The reason I did that was to highlight the total failure of this administration but also to tell the people of the island you’re Americans and we’re thinking of you too.” 
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who are also vying for the White House, have both visited Puerto Rico as well. Yulín Cruz is a co-chair of Sanders’ campaign.

"About 500 people remained evacuated Tuesday from their homes in Oregon after record-breaking rain that shut down roads and forced officials to close schools in the hardest-hit communities.
The evacuations followed moderate flooding Sunday night and Monday along the Coast Fork of the Willamette and Row rivers near Eugene, The Register-Guard reported .
The Lane County Sheriff's Office urged Eugene-area residents to stay off roads and said it was working to help people in several homes completely surrounded by water.
Firefighters rescued a 75-year-old man whose pickup truck went off a flooded stretch of road outside Eugene near Junction City, KVAL-TV reported .
More than 4.3 inches of rain has fallen in Eugene since Thursday, with a record-breaking 2.34 inches on Sunday alone. That's the most precipitation there in a single calendar day in more than seven years, and it breaks the mark for the wettest April day on record.
Andy Bryant, hydrologist for the National Weather Service in Portland, told the newspaper that the service has no record of a flood event in the southern Willamette Valley this late in the rainy season.
""The time of the year, just in my mind, makes it historically significant that we're having a flood like this a week into April,"" Bryant said. ""What we've had is more of a November through February kind of weather event.""
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is releasing more water than usual from Willamette River reservoirs to prevent overflow.
Highway 58 southeast of Eugene near Oakridge remained closed after it was cut off by a rockslide Monday. Oregon Transportation officials said on Twitter they were hoping to reopen the road late Tuesday afternoon.

"NBC News attempted to backtrack on an article published Wednesday which claimed President Donald Trump did not visit the troops over Christmastime when in fact, he did.
The liberal news outlet admitted in an extended editor's note that ""the thrust of this article is no longer correct."" NBC also adjusted the headline to: ""Trump becomes first president since 2002 not to visit troops on or before Christmas."" The president and first lady left Wednesday night to visit the troops on Thursday.
The note which was published at the top of the original article read: ""On Wednesday, NBC News compiled a list of every Christmastime visit to active troops by a president since 2001. That list, as detailed in the article below, showed that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama visited troops on or before Christmas every year since 2003, and President Donald Trump did so in 2017.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP 
""As of the end of Christmas Day 2018, Trump had not visited troops during the holiday season, and had announced no plans to do so. The article was correct, but on Dec. 26, the situation changed. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, made an unannounced visit to troops in Iraq. As a result, the thrust of this article is no longer correct, even if it was at the time.""
The note continued: ""In the interest of transparency, we are keeping the article on NBCNews.com so that the record will reflect the situation on the day the article was published, and are directing readers to the article about Trump’s Iraq visit here. We are also altering one line in the article, as well as the headline, to be more specific and to note that Trump was the first president since 2002 who didn’t visit military personnel on or before Christmas, rather than at Christmastime.""
NBC News' mistake comes after Trump's visit to Iraq was heavily criticized by the media. CNN's overwhelmingly negative reporting drew attention to some troops bringing MAGA hats for the president to sign and how this may be against the guidelines, which forbids active members of the military from participating in “political activities.”
CNN SLAMMED FOR TRASHING TRUMP'S VISIT TO TROOPS, CRITICIZING SOLDIERS FOR BRINGING MAGA HATS
The story by CNN politics reporter Eli Watkins, headlined “Troops bringing Trump hats to sign may violate military rule,” was criticized by press secretary Sanders, among others, who fired back at CNN on Thursday, tweeting that the network “will attack anyone who supports President Trump, including the brave men and women of our military who fight everyday to protect our freedom.”
CNN anchor Don Lemon also took shots at Trump for visiting the troops while the U.S. Coast Guard continues to work without pay during the partial government shutdown and later referred to Trump as “The Grinch” for making Christmas about him as well as his visit with the troops. Former NSA adviser Samantha Vinograd agreed, saying the president “should’ve stayed home.”
Later on, CNN’s April Ryan said Trump’s visit with the troops “should have happened a long time ago” and questioned whether everyone “should be commending him” for something presidents have done in the past.

"CHICAGO (AP) Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of Empire actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed the alleged attack on the actor, a police official said Wednesday.
Investigators for the most part can confirm the route Smollett took early Tuesday when he says he was attacked by two masked men along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. However, there are gaps and none of the footage police have reviewed shows the alleged attack, he said.
Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said the men beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an unknown chemical substance on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.
Guglielmi said detectives who are investigating the allegations as a possible hate crime, have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area. But he said they still need to collect and view more. He said they are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the crime scenes immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the men who match Molletts description of the suspects.
We havent seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave, nobody looks menacing and we didnt find a container anywhere, Guglielmi said, referring to a container for the liquid that was thrown at the actor.
Smollett, 36, returned to his apartment after the alleged attack and his manager called police from the apartment about 40 minutes later, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the thin rope around his neck that he said had been put there by his assailant, he said. Mollett later went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after police advised him to do so.
The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where Empire is filmed, Guglelmi said. The FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday, but Rep. Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, issued a statement calling on the agency to conduct an immediate and sweeping civil rights investigation into the racist and homophobic attack.
In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a musical career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues.
The alleged attack sparked outrage and a flood of support for Smollett on social media. Among the many celebrities and politicians who weighed in was California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, who called the attack on the actor she knows personally outrageous and awful.
Some of the outrage stems from Smolletts account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in MAGA country, an apparent reference to the Trump campaigns Make America Great Again slogan, which some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.
Chicago has one of the most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems in the U.S., with thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.
Police say the cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests. In one of the most famous examples of the police departments use of the cameras, investigators in 2009 were able to recreate a school board presidents 20-minute drive through the city, singling out his car on a succession of surveillance cameras to help them determine that he committed suicide and had not been followed and killed by someone else, as his friends speculated.","CHICAGO (AP) — Detectives have reviewed surveillance footage of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett walking to a downtown Chicago apartment after an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, but none of it showed the alleged attack on the actor, a police officia…",2019-01-30T15:39:58Z,Police: No footage yet of alleged attack on 'Empire' actor - The Associated Press,Associated Press,0

DUBAI - At least 18 people were killed and around 100 others were wounded in flash floods in Iran's southern province of Fars, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Monday, following devastating floods in the north.
State TV said several provinces were also on high alert for more imminent flooding because of heavy rain. The meteorology department warned people about rain forecast for the coming days, state radio reported, urging them to avoid any trips.
As the victims of the northern Iran flood struggled with the water and mud, President Hassan Rouhani's hardline rivals have criticized his government for doing too little, too late.
Iran's hardline judiciary said on Sunday the government's handling of the disaster was being investigated, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.
""Any shortcomings regarding the handling of the floods, failure to provide relief and aid to the survivors will be investigated,"" it quoted judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi as saying.
Hardline cleric Raisi lost the 2017 presidential election, when Rouhani was re-elected.
The semi-official Fars news agency reported on Monday that Rouhani has returned to Tehran from Iran's Qeshm Island in the Gulf, where he had been spending the Iranian new year holiday.
He was criticized by Iranians on social media for being in the south when flooding was hitting the north of the country.

In a rare move, Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on the armed forces to help the flood-hit northern provinces.
Iran's hardline media have accused the government reacting too slowly to the floods, while highlighting aid work by the Revolutionary Guards - a rival power center in Iran's faction-ridden political establishment.
Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri fired the governor of Golestan province, according to Tasnim, for not cutting short his trip abroad during the floods.
The spread of flooding to the south follows days of floods that affected more than 56,000 people living in 270 villages and small towns in the northern provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran, on the Caspian Sea, since March 19, TV reported.
In Shiraz, in the south, Tasnim quoted the head of Iran's emergency medical services, Pirhossein Kolivand, as saying 18 people had been killing, including four children. Some 94 were injured in the city in Fars province.
TV aired footage of cars caught in flood waters in Shiraz. Iran's Students News Agency ISNA said high water had damaged thousands of houses in Shiraz and other towns.
""We all are going to die. Pray for us. We are all going to die. Mother, we all are going to die,"" said a woman in a bus caught in the floods in Shiraz, according to a video posted on Twitter.
Fars Governor Enayatollah Rahimi told state TV the flooding was under control and rescue and aid workers had been dispatched to the flood-hit areas.
Kolivand later said one other person was also killed in Sarpol-e Zahab in the western province of Kermanshah.
Authorities also have warned about possibility of floods in the capital, Tehran, as well as in the oil-rich southern province of Khuzestan in the next 48 hours.","At least 18 people were killed and around 100 others were wounded in flash floods in Iran's southern province of Fars, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Monday.",2019-03-25T20:28:14Z,"Floods kill at least 18 in southern Iran, nearly 100 wounded",NBC News,1
"The northern Great Plains isnt the only place dealing with unprecedented flooding at the moment. A series of deadly drenchings is ongoing in Iran, just days after the countrys celebration of Nowruz the Iranian New Year.
Hardest-hit was Shiraz, a city of 1.8 million about 100 miles inland east of the Persian Gulf. It has a Mediterranean climate, averaging 1.91 inches of rain in March, according to the World Meteorological Organization. From Tuesday to Wednesday, more than a months worth of rain fell, tallying 2.33 inches and wreaking havoc as floodwaters engulfed the city.
The bulk of the rain came down Tuesday in what Al Jazeera called only two sets of 15-minute heavy rainfalls. The pair of swift deluges overwhelmed the sandy grounds ability to soak up water, causing it to funnel into roadways that quickly became rivers.
Part of what made the city so vulnerable to flooding amidst seemingly less-than-impressive rain amounts is its location in the Zagros foothills. That makes it susceptible to channeling effects in rivers and valleys, reminiscent of the scenes that unfolded in Ellicott City, Md., last May.
At least 23 are reported dead, with more than 200 injured. After rounds of morning rain, drier air and sunshine will overspread the beleaguered region this afternoon, affording an opportunity to survey the damage and begin recovery.
According to The Jerusalem Post, thousands have been relocated to emergency shelters provided by the government, displaced as the floodwaters slowly recede. A number of at-risk dams also pose a downstream flood hazard.
The rains behind Shirazs flooding werent relegated to Irans south. Flood concerns first arose last week as moisture-loaded storms targeted northern regions on the shores of the Caspian Sea.
Most places in Iran average about 10 inches of rain or less per year. That scant precipitation classifies a large chunk of the nation as semi-desert. While verdant forests and lush woodlands blanket the more humid northern stretches bordering the Caspian Sea, the vegetation drops off the farther south. When water comes down as bountifully as it did Tuesday, communities arent always prepared.
The Yasoge weather station, about 90 miles northwest of Shiraz in the town of Yasuj, picked up 0.44 inches on Monday noteworthy on its own, but dwarfed by the nearly half foot of water that dropped Tuesday. Thats more than the mean rainfall for February and March combined in Washington.
Khorramabad, in west-central Iran, got its heavy rainfall Monday with 3.07 inches, followed by an additional 0.8 inches Tuesday. Meanwhile, Gach Saran Du Gunbadans weather station didnt see a drop of water on Monday, but was soaked with 3.20 inches Tuesday.
Irans capital of Tehran is dealing with floods creeping in on the citys east side, although downtown should likely escape unscathed. Just under three-quarters of an inch was measured through Tuesday afternoon.
The highly variable day-to-day distribution of rainfall is characteristic of convective environments. Scattered slow-moving heavy showers or thunderstorms deliver feast-or-famine rainfall totals a regime in which training or stalled storms can rapidly spell disaster. Towering storm tops are visible in satellite shots, while water vapor imagery shows the violent clash between dry and moist air.
Irans wet season will continue for another month or so before the dry heat of summer sets in.","A series of deadly drenchings are ongoing in Iran, just days after the country’s celebration of Nowruz – the Iranian New Year.",2019-03-27T19:32:09Z,"Floodwaters deluge Iran, killing at least 23, after a month’s worth of rain turns roads into rivers",The Washington Post,1
"The ability of Internet users to spread a video of Fridays slaughter in New Zealand marked a triumph however appalling of human ingenuity over computerized systems designed to block troubling images of violence and hate.
People celebrating the mosque attacks that left 50 people dead were able to keep posting and reposting videos on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter despite the websites use of largely automated systems powered by artificial intelligence to block them. Clips of the attack stayed up for many hours and, in some cases, days.
This failure has highlighted Silicon Valleys struggles to police platforms that are massively lucrative yet also persistently vulnerable to outside manipulation despite years of promises to do better.
Fridays uncontrolled spread of horrific videos a propaganda coup for those espousing hateful ideologies also raised questions about whether social media can be made safer without undermining business models that rely on the speed and volume of content uploaded by users worldwide. In Washington and Silicon Valley, the incident crystallized growing concerns about the extent to which government and market forces have failed to check the power of social media.
Its an uncontrollable digital Frankenstein, said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.
Those pushing videos of Fridays attack made small alterations such as changing the color tones or length of the shooting video originally live-streamed by the alleged killer himself through his Facebook page. Such tricks often were enough to evade detection by artificial-intelligence systems designed by some of the worlds most technologically advanced companies to block such content.
But for all of the investment in such technology, even more has gone into building social media platforms into powerful springboards for delivering images, sounds and words to as many people as possible for the purpose of generating advertising revenue that fuels profits measured in the tens of billions of dollars each year.
The only good thing thats come out of this is that it laid bare the lie that the big tech companies can solve this problem with AI, because they really cannot, said Cathy ONeil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction, about the societal impact of algorithms. Nobody knows how to counteract this stuff. They should stop pretending they do.""
Mia Garlick, the head of communications and policy for Facebook in Australia and New Zealand, said the company would work around the clock to remove violating content using a combination of technology and people. Garlick said the company is also now even removing edited versions of the video that do not feature graphic violence.
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment Monday, and Reddit declined to comment, but both have described working hard over several days to remove objectionable content from the shooting. For Reddit, that includes forums named gore and watchpeopledie.
YouTube, in an exclusive interview with The Washington Post, acknowledged that its systems were overwhelmed and vowed to make improvements. Weve made progress, but that doesnt mean we dont have a lot of work ahead of us, and this incident has shown that, said Neal Mohan, YouTubes chief product officer.
Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have scrambled before and largely failed to contain odious content on their platforms. Nor is this the first time killers have used social media to deliver images of their crimes.
But nobody before had staged a mass-casualty attack in a way so geared to spreading it virally across social media. Many critics worry that now that it has happened once, it almost certainly will happen again.
Micah Schaffer, a technology policy consultant and a former director at YouTube, said that over the past decade social media companies have designed software to more effectively promote content to broad audiences. Those design choices, he said, have made it easier for content to spread online.
Back in 2007, when I was at YouTube, if a video on the homepage was a success, that meant getting hundreds of thousands of views, Schaffer said. These videos were handpicked, and we scrutinized each one. Compare that today to the recommendation algorithm sending millions of views to videos with no human intervention. To me, thats just irresponsible.
Those who study social media say that slowing the spread of appalling videos might require the companies to change or limit some features that help spread stimulating content. These include powerful search and recommendation algorithms, nearly instantaneous uploads and auto-play.
The companies losing battle to keep content in check already is having financial consequences. Facebooks stock saw its steepest drop of the year, falling more than three percent on Monday. Needham &amp; Co. analyst Laura Martin blamed the negative effects of horrific images ... that are technologically difficult to block at the 100% level and which hurt (Facebooks) brand.
Shares in Google's parent company Alphabet slid less than 1 percent.
The day of the New Zealand shooting, the alleged gunman, Brenton Tarrant, posted on the anonymous message board 8chan that he would ""live stream the attack via facebook"" and included a link to Facebook and a number of other sites where he had stored an anti-Muslim manifesto and other documents.
Within minutes of this announcement, a flood of anonymous posters were cheering him on and rallying to save and re-upload the video widely online to give it maximum distribution: ""I am downloading it""; ""Stream saved""; ""SAVE THIS S*** NOW""; ""GRAB THEM WHILE YOU CAN.""
One poster wrote that the gunmen had ""delivered"" on his pledge: ""I just saw him kill so many"" people, using an obscene term for Muslims. ""Nice shootin,"" another wrote. 8chan did not respond to requests for comment.
""Human nature has always had evil and horrific elements to it. But we're not asking for the platforms to solve humanity that's not the issue, said Mike Ananny, an associate professor of communication at the University of Southern California. These companies have the advertising monopolies, the eyeball-attention monopolies. We have to expect them to be a much more responsible player than they are.""
When the tech giants want to block a troubling video, they add the original to a vast internal blacklist so that their systems can quickly recognize whenever a copy of it resurfaces. This type of hashing technology is a key reason why companies can automatically flag or block child pornography, terrorist propaganda and copyrighted material before it spreads widely online.
But their algorithms depend on pattern recognition, and even the most sophisticated systems are easily deceived. Anyone hoping to spread an otherwise-blocked video such as movie pirates and creators of extremist videos can cut out shorter snippets or change the videos playing speed, coloring, sound or video size, then upload it again.
Facebook said it blocked 80 percent of the New Zealand first-person shooting videos from being uploaded within the first 24 hours, but that roughly 300,000 videos slipped through a showing that put them within reach of millions of people online.
U.S. law largely shields major tech platforms from being held liable for the content users post to their sites. Silicon Valley sees this decades old legal shield known as Section 230 for the provision in law it represents as the reason that major social media sites have flourished without having to defend themselves against lawsuits.
But frustrated lawmakers from both parties increasingly are wondering if the time has come to craft new legislation to curb such digital ills as hate speech and terrorist propaganda.
I think that we absolutely need to have a hearing, and understand exactly what happened in the situation, to determine the best solutions to prevent it from happening in the future, said Democratic Rep. Suzan Delbene of Washington. What happened in New Zealand is horrifying, and heart breaking, and that video should never be available online.
But a chief architect of Section 230, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), urged caution. While stressing tech giants must be far more vigorous about identifying, fingerprinting and blocking content and individuals who incite hate and violence, Wyden said that eliminating the section could have unintended consequences for free speech.
So often in the wake of horrible events politicians grasp for knee-jerk responses that wont solve real problems, and may even make them worse,"" he added in a statement.
European policymakers have been more aggressive in holding technology giants responsible for what appears on their platforms. Germany, for example, began enforcing a law last year that requires social media sites to remove instances of hate speech within 24 hours. The European Union broadly has proposed rules that would give Facebook, YouTube and others an hour to remove terrorist content or face hefty fines.
Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg told congressional lawmakers last year that human moderators and AI systems would help the company solve some of its most intractable problems, including automatically flagging harmful videos.
But AI researchers have said that view doesnt factor in the vast number of ways in which automated systems fail to come even close to human ability, including in understanding context and common sense. Todays algorithms excel at certain tasks but are what AI engineers call frustratingly brittle, with even small changes to their tasks or training data quickly leading them to collapse.
Stephen Merity, a machine-learning researcher in San Francisco, said the tech companies dont want to use more drastic measures, such as tougher restrictions on who can upload or bigger investments in content-moderation teams, because of how they could alter their sites usability or business model. They dont want to do that, so they make these wild promises.
But you cant bank on future magical innovations.

Among them were 21-year-old Gaspar Armando and his extended family of 15. When the cyclone ripped though Buzi on March 14, they stayed in their four homes made of sticks and mud until the storm tore off the sheet-metal roofs and the walls collapsed. 
Around midnight, with the rain horizontal, the family ran to a small concrete slaughterhouse nearby. They have lived there ever since, climbing onto the blue steel roof when the floods came. 
“The government knew it was going to be bad but they didn’t find us a safe place. They didn’t organize it,” Armando said. 
Such scenes played out in many other towns and villages, survivors said. Government and humanitarian officials said they did not anticipate the extent of flooding in one of the most severe storms to hit Africa’s east coast in more than a decade. 
An early warning system implemented by the government did not reach everyone and in the poorest, most remote areas there are few solid structures where people can shelter, aid workers and residents said. 
The death toll had reached 468 in Mozambique by Tuesday and hundreds of thousands of others were in need of food, water and shelter, according to the United Nations.

NO PLACE TO GO 
Many people are angry that the government did not do more to protect them. Reuters’ interviews with 18 people in four communities spread across 100 kilometers (62 miles) showed the warning systems proved insufficient. 
Four of those interviewed said they had received no warning about the impending storm. The others said they were warned but were offered no help moving to a safer place. 
Makeshift camps were set up on higher ground only after the flooding, they said, so many people decided to see out the storm in their homes. 
“We thought it would just be a little rain,” said Louisa Ndega, 60, sheltering at a camp in the village of Guara Guara. 
Mozambique’s land and environment minister, Celso Correia, who is leading the government’s response to the disaster, told Reuters it was not clear until the final days before the storm where it would hit. 
The area under threat was too vast and, with about 7 million inhabitants, too heavily populated to be evacuated, he said. 
Mozambique was also hit by deadly floods and cyclones in 2000 and 2007, and since then has beefed up its response team and implemented an early-warning system. 
The system was triggered weeks before Cyclone Idai, with red flags raised to alert people to the dangers, Correia said. 
He said people had been told to seek higher ground when they saw the flags flying, but that no one could have predicted the force and speed of the flooding when two big rivers burst their banks following the cyclone. 
The area around the coastal town of Beira, where the cyclone made landfall, started flooding within 36 hours of the storm and was soon unrecognizable, with brown water covering the land. 
“These floods were extreme,” Correia said. “It was almost instantaneous.” 
Philippe Caroff, a forecaster at the regional cyclone center on the French island of La Reunion, said his agency’s forecasts were showing a “high level of threat” for the region almost three days before the cyclone made landfall, including storm surges of nearly four meters (13 ft) around Beira. 
“It was not difficult to imagine that flooding would become a problem, because the area is very flat,” he said. 
There had also been a significant amount of rain in the preceding months, the wet season in Mozambique, he said. 
The country’s national weather service receives updates from the center, and cyclone bulletins are available on its website, Caroff said. 
EARLY WARNINGS 
He said he had sent an email to the chief forecaster at the Mozambique weather service when the risk of a worst-case scenario became apparent. In it, he said, he expressed hope that all preparations had been made for Beira’s coastal frontline. 
Mozambique’s weather service could not immediately be reached by phone and did not respond to an email seeking comment. 
The United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which is overseeing the international relief effort, declined comment on the government’s preparations. 
From Mozambique, Cyclone Idai tore inland into Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and causing deadly mudslides. 
At least 179 people were killed in Zimbabwe, where the Department of Civil Protection had sent text messages and issued radio and television warnings advising people to move away from areas in the cyclone’s path two days before it hit. 
But in Zimbabwe’s worst affected district, Chimanimani, many said they had no place to go because the government had not provided shelter, and there was no mandatory evacuation order. 
In Malawi, the death toll stood at 60. 
Scientists believe climate change will make cyclones like Idai more frequent, making it vital that systems are in place to protect the most vulnerable, according to humanitarian agencies. 
“There are definitely lessons to be learned,” said Pierluigi Testa, an emergency coordinator for the international aid group Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). 
Testa said a network of purpose-built, reinforced-concrete storm shelters similar to ones used in Bangladesh could have offered protection against the cyclone. 
Correia said there was no time to set up such facilities in Mozambique. About 300,000 people had moved to higher ground though even some of these places ended up under water, he said. 
“I FELT LIKE WE WERE GOING TO DIE” 
No one interviewed by Reuters moved in anticipation of the storm. Some sought refuge in sturdy buildings such as schools. 
At a hospital south of Beira, Catarina Meque, 21, said the water was already rising when she received the flood warning. 
Medical staff started shouting to people to climb onto beds but hospital workers fled as the water got higher, and Meque said she followed with her malnourished six-month-old baby. 
“I felt like we were going to die if we waited there,” she said in Guara Guara, which she reached after walking for 17 hours through waist-high water. 
About 100 km northwest of Beira, in the devastated village of John Segredo, villagers said they received no warning at all. 
Many people remain fearful. In Buzi, a mother holding a young child asked: “The water it’s not coming back, is it?”

"In many places, local journalism is dying in plain sight. And it's having serious damaging effects on the American communities that have lost their newspapers.
Local papers are closing or being consolidated at an astounding rate, often leaving behind what researchers label as news deserts -- towns and even entire counties that have no consistent local media coverage.
According to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by the University of North Carolina, more than 1,400 towns and cities in the U.S. have lost a newspaper over the past 15 years. Many of those are in rural and lower-income areas, often with an aging population.
The loss of a reliable local news source has many consequences for the community. One of them is the inability to watchdog the actions of government agencies and elected officials.
Consider Waynesville, Missouri, where Darrell Todd Maurina is the only local reporter on the scene at Pulaski County courthouse to tell residents what their commissioners are up to. He's the only one who'll report on their deliberations about how to satisfy the Federal Emergency Management Agency so it will pay to repair a road inundated during a 2013 flood.
Maurina, who posts his work to Facebook, represents the local press -- in its entirety.
A town's daily diary
The reasons for the newspapers' closures vary. But the result is that many Americans no longer have someone watching the city council for them, chronicling the soccer exploits of their children or reporting on the kindly neighbor who died.
A microfilm copy of the Daily Guide at the library in Waynesville, Missouri. The newspaper shut down in September 2018.
Orlin Wagner / AP
The Daily Guide, which traces to 1962, served the twin towns of Waynesville and St. Robert near the Army's sprawling Fort Leonard Wood. It was a family-owned paper into the 1980s before it was sold to a series of corporate owners that culminated with GateHouse Media Inc., the nation's largest newspaper company.
As recently as 2010, the Daily Guide had four full-time news people, along with a page designer and three ad salespeople.
But people left and weren't replaced. Last spring, the Daily Guide was cut from five to three days a week. In June, the last newsroom staffer, editor Natalie Sanders, quit -- she was burned out, she said. The last edition was published three months later, on Sept. 7.
""It felt like an old friend died,"" Sanders said. ""I sat and I cried, I really did.""
Which came first?
The death of the Daily Guide raises questions not easily answered, the same ones asked at newspapers big and small across the country.
Did GateHouse stop investing because people were less interested in reading the paper? Or did people lose interest because the lack of investment made it a less satisfying read?
GateHouse said the Daily Guide, like many smaller newspapers across the country, was hurt by a dwindling advertising market among national retailers. It faces the same financial pressures as virtually every other newspaper company: Circulation in the U.S. has declined every year for three decades, while advertising revenue across the industry has nosedived since 2006, according to the Pew Research Center.
The challenges are especially difficult in smaller communities.
""They're getting eaten away at every level,"" said Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst at Harvard's Nieman Lab.
""Losing a newspaper,"" said Keith Pritchard, 63, chairman of the board at the Security Bank of Pulaski County and a lifelong resident, ""is like losing the heartbeat of a town.""
""I miss the newspaper, the chance to sit down over a cup of coffee and a bagel or a doughnut ... and find out what's going on in the community,"" said Bill Slabaugh, a retiree. Now he talks to friends and ""candidly, for the most part, I'm ignorant.""
News no longer spreads
Beyond the emotions are practical concerns about the loss of an information source.
Like many communities, Waynesville is struggling with a drug problem. The four murders last year were the most in memory, and all were drug-related.
Without a newspaper's reporting, Waynesville Police Chief Dan Cordova said many in the community are unaware of the extent of the problem. Social media is a resource, but Cordova is concerned about not reaching everyone.
So Waynesville is left with local radio and Maurina's Facebook site. Maurina says for journalism to survive, reporters need to get back to the basics of being at every event and ""telling everyone what the sirens were about last night.""
An investigation gets results
The Fresno Bee represents another story about local journalism and its impact on the community it serves. One of the last investigations Jim Boren oversaw before he retired as the paper's executive editor was a four-month examination of substandard housing in the city at the heart of California's Central Valley.
The multimedia project revealed the living conditions imposed on many of the city's low-income renters, many of them immigrants: apartments filled with mold, mice and cockroaches, to name some of the more glaring problems. Local housing advocates compared it to the tainted water crisis in Flint, Michigan.
The investigation got immediate results.
""We made people's lives better. We changed laws,"" said Boren, who retired in 2017 and is now director of the Institute for Media and Public Trust at Fresno State University.
Among other things, the city responded by requiring property owners to make repairs when it found violations, rather than just levy fines.
""Those are the kinds of things that journalists do,"" Boren said.
Not all hope is lost
And it's the kind of journalism -- holding local government officials accountable for problems that affect the lives of real people -- that is in danger of being lost in many communities around the country.
This isn't a hopeless story.
Dotted across the country are exceptions to the brutal new rule, newspapers that are surviving with creative business plans. In North Carolina's Moore County, owners support the 100-year-old Pilot with revenue raised by side businesses — lifestyle magazines, electronic newsletters, telephone directories, a video production company and a bookstore.
Philanthropy is supporting other efforts to fill gaps created by journalism's business struggles. Report for America, which sees itself as a Peace Corps for journalists, has sent young reporters into communities in Mississippi, Texas and elsewhere. It has relationships with newsrooms across the country, including The Associated Press. The American Journalism Project is raising money to fund local news, and recently announced $42 million in pledges.
What this effort means for Waynesville, and many small towns like it, remains to be seen.
It briefly had an alternative after the Daily Guide folded. A local businessman, Louie Keen, bankrolled a newspaper, the Uranus Examiner, that was delivered for free. It folded after five issues.
""Equal opportunity agitator""
So Waynesville and St. Robert are left with Darrell Todd Maurina's Facebook site, which he calls the Pulaski County Daily News.
Maurina's efforts have some support, even from the city councilman who said he once threatened to throw Maurina out a window over a disagreement about a story.
""He's an equal opportunity agitator,"" said Ed Conley, another council member. ""He tries to be fair, and to be honest about it, he does a good job, but he's just one person and he's limited by social media.""","As their reporting disappears, residents no longer have anyone watching over government agencies and elected officials",2019-03-11T12:47:39Z,Losing local newspapers leaves many communities in the dark,CBS News,0
"Kimber Biggs felt joy when she heard Jayme Closs had come home -- and a deep aching pain. 
""I couldn't believe it. I was -- I remember I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend and I just, like, gasped. And he was like, 'What?' And I was like, 'Jayme Closs was found alive,' said Biggs.
""When something like this happens, does that give you renewed hope?"" asked ""48 Hours"" correspondent Erin Moriarty.
""Um, somewhat,"" Biggs replied.
She has always hoped to see her own sister Mikelle walk back in the door.
""How would you describe Mikelle?"" Moriarty asked.
""She was perfect,"" Biggs replied, laughing. ""…she was funny and smart."" 
Mikelle Biggs
Justice for Mikelle Biggs
Mikelle was a sixth-grade honor student in Mesa, Arizona, who played clarinet and wanted to be a Disney animator when she grew up.
""She was amazing to be around,"" said Biggs.
It was the evening of Jan 2, 1999. Kimber then 9, and Mikelle, 11, were outside playing. Mikelle had Kimber's bike as both waited for an ice cream truck.
""Mikelle was riding my bike … And she was doing big circles,"" Biggs recalled. ""When I said, ""Well, I'm cold. I'm going inside."" And, you know, I crossed the street. …And I remember I looked and I saw her riding, still doing big circles in the street. And that was the last time I saw her."" 
When Kimber went back outside, her bike was there, but Mikelle was gone. It only took 90 seconds.
""The thing that sticks out most in my mind about that day is the bike in the road,"" Biggs explained. ""You know, it was on its side. The tire was still spinning.""
What followed was a blur of yellow ribbons in trees, cameras and investigators questioning the 9-year-old.
""It took 30 minutes for 1,000 people to be looking for her,"" Biggs said. ""And there was every news station and multiple police cars and people organizing search parties."" 
Abductions like Mikelle's are rare. Less than one percent of missing children are reported as having been abducted by a stranger.
""This one immediately was different-- from the get-go, it was different,"" said Mesa Police Detective Steve Berry. A patrol officer back then, Berry joined the massive manhunt.
""No one had seen anything. She just simply seemed to be gone without a trace,"" he told Moriarty.
""Police will -- flood an area when a child is missing because they know the clock is ticking, and it's ticking loudly,"" explained Jim Walsh, a local print reporter whocovered the story from the beginning.
Walsh says investigators had very few leads and no physical evidence.
""No one heard her cry, call out?"" Moriarty asked Walsh.
 ""No,"" he replied. ""I never heard of anybody actually seeing anything or hearing anything.""
""…there's a reason they say Mikelle Biggs vanished into thin air, because it looks like she did,"" said Biggs.
Police questioned everyone in the neighborhood, starting with Mikelle's father Darien.
""They never named anybody a suspect. But … they looked pretty hard at him. And -- I think part of it was his personality,"" said Walsh. ""Darien was more of a aloof person. Didn't mean that he didn't feel it inside, you know. But he was just a less demonstrative person.""
But Darien Biggs was quickly cleared.
""I was very angry,"" said Kimber Biggs. ""My heart was broken that my dad had to go through that on top of not having his little girl.""
Investigators also questioned neighbors, including Dee Blalock, who lived just two blocks away.
""They knocked on his door. They spoke to him. They spoke to his wife. His wife gave an alibi to the effect that he was out … in the garage … watching the Cardinals game,"" said Walsh.
In an interview with a local news station, Blalock appeared to be a law and order guy:
""If you're my neighbor, and I see that you're living next to me, and I see something suspicious going on, I guarantee you I'll be calling 911,"" Blalock told the reporter. 
Blalock was described as ""friendly"" and ""personable."" 
""The police moved on and they kept looking,"" said Walsh.
As the years passed and leads dried up, the case went cold.
""My room was right next to hers. And -- I remember hearing my mom in there a couple times crying, you know. I remember listening to that and just wishing that my parents didn't have to go through that,"" said Biggs.
And then, on March 14, 2018, about 1,700 miles away -- there was a glimmer of hope.
""I was sitting at my desk one day when I got a phone call from a reporter in Wisconsin,"" said Det. Perry.
A dollar bill was turned in to the Neenah Police by a man who said he had found it in stack of bills collected as payment for Girl Scout cookies. A child's scrawling on it caught his eye.
""It said – 'My name is Mikelle Biggs. Kidnapped from Mesa. I'm alive,'"" said Kimber Biggs. 
""Did that give you hope? Did you think, 'Is this possible?"""" Moriarty asked.
""It, kind of, did for a moment. It was -- it was hope. But then also -- you know, I felt shattered, like 'God, if she is alive, what is she going through?'"" Biggs said.
""But I remember looking at it and the fact that her name was misspelled and … the handwriting … it just didn't look like her handwriting. to me it looked like someone trying to write like a child,"" she continued.
""Why would someone do that?"" Moriarty asked.
""I'm not sure. You know, there's some horrible people out there and I deal with quite a few of them on a regular basis,"" Biggs replied.
But what felt like a promising lead quickly turned into another frustrating dead end.
In any case, Kimber feels she knows who took her sister. Nearly two years after Mikelle vanished, the neighbor who said he knew nothing -- Dee Blalock -- was convicted of beating and raping a neighbor.
""He allegedly made some comments -- while incarcerated in prison -- tying back to this case. Needless to say, that stirred things up again"" said Det. Berry.
Blalock has repeatedly denied any involvement. There is no physical evidence to tie him to the crime.
""That's what's one of the hardest things about this case. There's nothing to go on. And even though I do, kind of, feel that Dee Blalock is responsible-- you know, that's not good enough.  I'm not gonna settle for 'I think it's him,'"" Biggs reasoned.
January 2, 2019, marked 20 years since Mikelle Biggs was last seen, and Kimber is now the mother of a 6-year-old son.
""I'm a helicopter mom. If we're at the park and he goes behind the play structure, I get up so I can see him. I mean, I do not let him out of my sight,"" she told Moriarty.
In 90 seconds Kimber Biggs lost her sister and her childhood, and she still wants to know why.
""I hope that she is alive and well and that we get her back,"" she said. ""But, you know, then reality kicks in and then I think, well, then my hopes need to just be that I know who took her and we find her body and give her, you know, the proper burial that she deserves.""",The Mesa 11-year-old was riding her sister’s bike when she disappeared in 1999,2019-01-12T23:27:22Z,Family of Mikelle Biggs holds out hope for answers in Arizona girl’s abduction,CBS News,0
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was named the recipient of this year's Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. The award, which has been called the Nobel Prize for public figures, is given for an act, or a lifetime, of political courage.
In a statement, Caroline Kennedy called Pelosi ""the most important woman in American political history.""
The first female to be elected Speaker, and the first person elected Speaker in non-consecutive terms in over 60 years, Pelosi has served in the House of Representatives since 1987. The California Democrat worked with a Republican president to pass an economic bailout package in 2008, and with a Democratic president to pass landmark healthcare reform in 2010, despite strong opposition in both cases. 
""So, the courage that that takes, really, I think, makes her an example and an inspiration for generations of Americans, men and women,"" Kennedy said. 
""Coming from Caroline, that's an enormous compliment,"" Pelosi told ""Sunday Morning"" correspondent Martha Teichner. ""However, going with it are shoulders for other people to stand on. I've stood on many women's shoulders, who have paved the way for us. And now we have to pave the way for others. So, it's about the future."" 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ushers in the 116th Congress of the United States, with the children and grandchildren of legislators in attendance. 
CBS News
Thin-skinned she is not, and with attacks coming at her even from within her own party, there is a lesson there: ""You have to be ready to take a punch, and you have to be ready to throw a punch,"" Pelosi said. ""I'm in the arena. And I know that when you're in the arena, this is what you should expect. But if you don't have the courage, don't get in the arena.""
Nancy Pelosi: Checks and balances
In 1956, as a young Senator and war hero, John F. Kennedy published ""Profiles in Courage"" about some of his own heroes – eight U.S. Senators who did what they thought was right, not what was popular, even if it destroyed their political careers. The book won the Pulitzer Prize. 
As a teenager, Pelosi was pictured standing next to Senator Kennedy, her idol: ""My father was the mayor of Baltimore and there was a big dinner, black tie dinner, where Senator Kennedy was going to speak. My mother, she said, 'If you want to go in my place to the dinner, please do.'
Nancy Pelosi with Senator John F. Kennedy.

""It's a great picture, relating to the inspiration that President Kennedy was to my generation and those that followed,"" she said. 
Caroline Kennedy, the president's daughter, said, ""In 1989, our family was thinking about how to memorialize him and remember him, and we decided to do it by honoring the quality that he thought was most essential in public life, which was courage.""
Since then, every year, the Profile in Courage Award has been given, without regard to party. It's silver and heavy and made to look like a ship's lantern. ""We wanted something that would be both symbolic and beautiful,"" Caroline said. ""Hopefully, the symbolism of the lantern will also help us all go forward, following our courageous leader.""
Teichner asked Jack Schlossberg, Caroline Kennedy's son, who join his mother in the award presentation, about civic involvement – his inherited legacy in many ways.
""To think that I inherited a legacy of public service just based on the fact that I'm related to public servants would be to misunderstand what they stood for,"" Schlossberg replied. ""I think everyone inherits a legacy of public service just based on the men and women who have served before them and have made our country what it is today.""
Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg show correspondent Martha Teichner the Profile in Courage Award.
CBS News
In his introduction to ""Profiles in Courage,"" JFK wrote: ""Compromise need not mean cowardice,"" a surprising concept in today's climate of political divisiveness, along with bi-partisanship.
In 1999, the award was given jointly to two Senators, Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who together pushed to regulate special interest money in politics. 
McCain's widow, Cindy McCain, said, ""The two of them were so dedicated to it, it was part of both their lives, but particularly my husband; it was the essence of who he was.""
Teichner asked, ""Did he get criticized? Was he vilified?""
""Oh yeah, oh, gosh, yeah!"" she laughed. 
Caroline Kennedy presents the Profile in Courage Award to Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold at a 1999 ceremony.

Cindy McCain remembers it was Ted Kennedy who told her husband he had won the award: ""John and Ted were polar opposites politically. They fought on the floor, swear words, I mean complete knock-down-drag-out. And when it was over, Ted walked over to John, put his arm around him, said, 'Wasn't that fun?'""
The day of the ceremony was the McCains' son Jimmy's birthday, so the Kennedys arranged for them all to arrive in style on a Coast Guard cutter. 
Speaking of the award, Cindy McCain said her husband described it to their children as ""a beacon of light.""
""It was very precious. This was, I believe, the most special award to John ever,"" she said. 
The famous and not-so-famous have been picked. In 1997 Alabama circuit judge Charles Price was honored for making the very unpopular call that his fellow judge, Roy Moore, was violating the Constitution by displaying the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. 
And in 2000, a kid from South Bend, Indiana named Pete Buttigieg, won the Profile in Courage high school essay contest. He wrote about Bernie Sanders. Now it looks like he's running against him for president. 
Elected Mayor of New Orleans in 2010, five years after Hurricane Katrina, Mitch Landrieu inherited a city still ravaged by the storm. ""I would tell the people of New Orleans, 'Look, if we're gonna come back, you have to sacrifice. This is gonna hurt.'""
On his watch, the city was rebuilt: new hospitals, new schools, a new airport, a massive new flood protection system. But it was something much riskier politically that won Landrieu last year's Profile in Courage Award, something suggested to him by his friend since childhood, trumpeter and New Orleans native Wynton Marsalis. He told Landrieu, ""You should take those monuments down.""
Marsalis was talking about the Confederate statues regarded as an affront by African Americans who represent more than 60% of the city's population.
Landrieu recalled, ""When he said that to me, really it was like getting hit in the head with a bat.""
He waited, then chose his moment, after white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine African Americans in a Charleston, S.C. church. Taking advantage of the national outrage, Landrieu announced that in New Orleans, the Confederate monuments would be removed. ""There is a difference, you see, between remembrance of history and the reverence of it,"" he said in May 2017 following the monuments' removal.
""The blowback was immediate,"" he said. ""Anybody who showed up to say they wanted to help started receiving awful phone calls, death threats. The first contractor that showed up had his car firebombed.""
Correspondent Martha Teichner asked, ""Did you have threats against you?""
""Oh, yeah, constantly. It was very intense.""
But finally, by May 2017, after more than two years of legal wrangling, all four of the monuments had come down.
Landrieu said, ""I was really just doing what I thought was the right thing, and I just didn't want to walk away from it, because I wanted to be able to live with myself.""
The inscription, from Kennedy's book ""Profiles in Courage,"" reads: ""In whatever arena of life one may meet the challenge of courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he follows his conscience … each man must decide for himself the course he will follow.""

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - An unprecedented boom in the $280 billion aircraft finance industry is showing signs of faltering as rising interest rates, cut-rate competition and higher oil prices trigger a shakeout in a sector that has attracted a flood of Chinese funding. Conferences in Hong Kong last week saw more than 1,000 financiers, lawyers and airline bosses talk up the fundamentals of an industry that has emerged as a flourishing asset class globally, but in contrast to previous years the mood was one of subdued optimism even as corks popped on new deals. Concerns about central bank tightening, trade rows and currency swings could blow some froth, they cautioned. “I think the party is over in terms of lower interest rates,” said Robert Martin, CEO of Asia’s largest-listed aircraft lessor BOC Aviation ( 2588.HK ). The sector veteran of three decades noted that smaller players who had not matched their funding needs to liabilities, unlike larger ones like his company, would find it difficult to ride out any volatility. The failure to do so has caused some high-profile collapses, such as Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) in the 1990s. The former GPA executives who now dominate the industry say the sector has matured and is backed by diversified sources of funding as aviation finance sits proudly alongside property and infrastructure as alternatives to traditional market bets. Yet danger signals have emerged, such as stronger dollar.DXY hitting the coffers of many airlines just as they must adjust to a spike in oil prices LCOc1. That could land unwanted aircraft back into the laps of lessors needing to find new takers. In a sign of turbulence ahead, global airlines have already slashed profit forecasts due to high oil prices. A few leasing companies are also quietly giving airlines rental ‘holidays’ to help their cash flows, sources said. And some airlines are increasing traffic only by cutting prices, which will hurt all but those with the lowest costs, said Rob Morris, chief consultant at Flight Ascend. According to Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of asset managers IBA: “The market is poised for the start of a correction. There are too many signals.” “When airlines feel pain, lessors feel pain.” DEALS DRIVE DOWN YIELDS The industry, however, remains in better shape than in previous cycles, driven by consolidation in the United States. Airlines have begun to recoup their costs of capital in the past four years after decades of value destruction, according to the International Air Transport Association. Demand for financing for new commercial aircraft deliveries is expected to rise almost 7 percent this year to $139 billion, Boeing ( BA.N ) has said. Last week, financiers were busy doing deals overlooking Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour at conferences hosted by Airline Economics and Euromoney’s Airfinance Journal. Lessors say liquidity is abundant and that financial strains in one part of the globe can be offset by demand elsewhere. Currently, Chinese capital accounts for about 30 percent of the funding deployed by leasing firms worldwide, up from 5 percent about nine years ago. But while the carousel continues, the flood of new money chasing deals has lowered returns for most in the industry. Goshawk Aviation, a venture of Hong Kong conglomerate NWS Holdings ( 0659.HK ) and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, says the sector’s low yields are not feasible for long. Brian Cheng, executive director at NWS that bought Dublin-based Sky Aviation Leasing this year, said he had seen funding bids from companies that are prepared to accept returns of 3-5 percent on their aircraft investments. “Insurance companies or banks can achieve (these rates) because their borrowing costs are so low... but for us there’s no way to compete with that.” “SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE” Against that backdrop, opportunistic M&amp;A is also picking up. Japan’s Orix Corp ( 8591.T ) struck a $2.2 billion deal this year for a 30 percent stake in leasing firm Avolon Holdings. SMBC Aviation Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking’s leasing arm, expects to receive an extra $1 billion from shareholders in a couple of months, Peter Barrett, CEO of the world’s No. 5 lessor said. But with air pockets in sight, industry executives increasingly point to an expected shakeout among smaller lessors. Some smaller Chinese players are already pulling back. “It’s like driving a car on the expressway. Everybody is on the gas pedal right now. No one is going to the gas station or taking a break. Everybody is full throttle but something has got to give. Some cars will just head off to the exit,” Cheng said.

"Another Pacific storm was set to hit California on Wednesday, bringing a threat of mudslides to the site of the deadliest wildfire in state history and a rare blizzard warning in the Sierra Nevada.
An evacuation warning was in place into Thursday morning for Pulga, a canyon community in Northern California. Its neighbor, the town of Paradise, was virtually incinerated two months ago by the Camp Fire that killed 86 people and destroyed nearly 15,000 homes.
The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for the county beginning late Wednesday afternoon.
""If flooding occurs, this can quickly become a dangerous and life-threatening situation,"" the Butte County Sheriff's Office warned.
The north could see the strongest storm of the year with heavy rain in the San Francisco Bay Area leading to a widespread flash flood watch beginning in the afternoon. Flood and high wind watches were scheduled for the Sacramento area, with the weather service warning that gusts could lead to power outages, downed trees and tough driving conditions.
A blizzard warning for much of the Sierra Nevada and Lake Tahoe was set to go into effect Wednesday night, with meteorologists predicting as much of 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow in upper elevations and wind gusts of up to 100 mph (161 kph) on ridgetops.
Dangerous and potentially life-threatening conditions were expected at elevations above 7,000 feet (2,133 meters), with high avalanche danger throughout the region.
A week of storms has left authorities concerned about the potential danger for thousands of people living in foothill and canyon areas devastated by last year's wildfires. Immense areas of the state were razed by wind-whipped flames, leaving hillsides bare of vegetation that could stabilize soil and prevent mudslides.
Several thousand people heeded a mandatory evacuation order in Santa Barbara County on the Central Coast, where last year a sudden debris flow swept through Montecito, killing 23 people and destroying 100 homes.
Daphne Moore was among the evacuees.
""It's a complete drag but it's better than dying in a mud debris flow,"" she told KNBC-TV.
However, the rain that fell Tuesday wasn't heavy enough to cause disaster and the county lifted the order Tuesday evening. More rain was expected Wednesday but not enough to be a serious threat, officials said.
Some mandatory evacuations remained in the Malibu area of Los Angeles County and voluntary evacuations were in place for some parts of Ventura County. Both were affected by November's Woolsey Fire that destroyed more than 1,500 homes and killed four people.
In the community of Bell Canyon in Ventura County, Paul Manion was busy filling sandbags.
""It's something we have to do. I mean, if the water comes, it comes,"" Manion told KABC-TV. ""Everything around our house burned. All the houses around our house burned. But it's the hillsides that we're worried about.""
Others refused to leave.
In Malibu, sheriff's deputies armed with clipboards went door-to-door at the high-risk Paradise Cove mobile home park. Julie Sturgess signed a declaration that she wouldn't evacuate.
""I have lived here since 1971, and there has been a lot of rain over the years,"" she told the Los Angeles Times.
Beaver Valenzuela told KABC-TV that he's survived fiercer storms and wouldn't leave until he was convinced there was more immediate danger.
""I'm not going anywhere,"" he said.","Another Pacific storm is bearing down on California, bringing a threat of mudslides to the site of the deadliest wildfire in state history and a rare blizzard warning in the Sierra Nevada",2019-01-16T06:22:46Z,New storm brings risk of blizzard to Northern California,ABC News,1
"Embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said Saturday that he was not in a racist 1984 yearbook photo of two men dressed in blackface and Ku Klux Klan garb, despite admitting he was in the picture a day earlier. He did, however, acknowledge darkening his face for another occasion that same year, when he dressed as singer Michael Jackson as part of a talent contest.
The governor also continued to assert that he won't resign over the photo controversy.
""When I was confronted with the image, I was appalled that it appeared on my page, but I believed then and I believe now that I am not either of the people in that photograph,"" he said at a press conference at the governor's mansion.
NORTHAM APOLOGIZES FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL YEARBOOK PHOTO WITH BLACKFACE, KKK ROBE
He apologized for the picture appearing on his page, calling the image ""offensive"" and ""racist,"" but said that he had nothing to do with the preparation of the yearbook, and that he did not purchase it.
He acknowledged that he had initially admitted to being in the image, but said that ""in the hours since I made my statement, I reflected with family and classmates from that time and it affirmed my conclusion that I am not the person in that photograph.""
Northam said that while he did not attend the party where the picture was taken, he did attend one the same year, for which he said he ""darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume.""
""I look back now and regret that I did not understand the harmful legacy of an action like that,"" he said. However, he went on to note that he had gone on to win that contest, in part because he could perform Jackson's signature dance move -- the Moonwalk.
He also said that he did not expect Virginians to believe him immediately or to forgive his actions right away: ""I am just asking for that ability to demonstrate that the person I was is not the man I am today.""
The photo was first published by Big League Politics Friday and immediately resulted in a firestorm of controversy, leading to Democrats both in Virginia and across the country calling for him to resign.
Fox News obtained a copy of 1984 yearbook page from the Eastern Virginia Medical School library in Norfolk.
His press conference marked a change from his stance on Friday, when he released a statement saying that the photo was of him -- without specifying whether he was the figure in blackface or the one in Klan attire. He apologized in both the statement and a later video statement, calling the photo ""racist and offensive,"" but also pledging to continue in office despite the increasing pressure for him to step down.
""Earlier today, a website published a photograph of me from my 1984 medical school yearbook in a costume that is clearly racist and offensive,"" he said. ""I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now.""
He said in the video that he has spent the last year as governor fighting for a Virginia “that works better for all people” and added : “I am committed to continuing that fight through the remainder of my term and living up to the expectations you set for me when you elected me to serve.”
But it didn't prevent a flood of Democrats calling on him to step down. On Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Northam to ""do the right thing"" and called the photo ""racist and contrary to fundamental American values.""
""The situation that he has put himself and the Commonwealth of Virginia in is untenable. It's time for Ralph to step down, and for the Commonwealth to move forward,"" Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said, calling the photo “racist, unacceptable and inexcusable at any age and at any time.”
Presidential hopefuls including Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. all called for him to step down on Friday night.
These images arouse centuries of anger, anguish, and racist violence and they’ve eroded all confidence in Gov. Northam’s ability to lead. We should expect more from our elected officials. He should resign,"" Booker said.
The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus said in a statement that the yearbook photos “rip the scabs of an excruciatingly painful history and are a piercing reminder of this nation’s sins. Those who would excuse the pictures are just as culpable.”
The caucus was not impressed by Northam's press conference, and amplified its calls for him to resign.
""In light of his pubic admission and apology for his decision to appear in the photo, he has irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve. Changing his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust,"" a statement Saturday afternoon said.
Republicans too had joined the calls that Northam should step down, with Virginia GOP Chairman Jack Wilson saying his pledge to fix the damage wasn’t enough.
“It’s not enough, it’s not acceptable and clearly we cannot establish a double standard,” he said on CNN Friday. “If this were a Republican governor, the calls for his resignation would be fast and furious and widespread.”
“He just basically lost the moral ability to lead the Commonwealth and so he should resign for the good of the Commonwealth,” he added.
Northam's press conference comes two days after he sparked outrage with comments about a controversial abortion bill that one sponsor had said could allow women to terminate a pregnancy up until the moment before birth.
Northam, a former pediatric neurologist, was asked about those comments and said that third-trimester abortions are done with “the consent of obviously the mother, with consent of the physician, multiple physicians by the way, and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities or there may be a fetus that’s not viable.”
“So in this particular example if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen, the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”
VIRGINIA GOV. NORTHAM FACES BACKLASH FOR COMMENTS ON 3RD-TRIMESTER ABORTION BILL: 'MORALLY REPUGNANT'
While the intent of the comments were not clear, conseravtive commentators and lawmakers took the remarks to mean he was discussing the possibility of letting a newborn die -- or even killing it outright.
Northam pushed back, with his office saying his comments were limited to actions physicians may take in the case of “tragic or difficult circumstances” such as a non-viable pregnancy or “severe fetal abnormalities.” He later tweeted: I have devoted my life to caring for children and any insinuation otherwise is shameful and disgusting.”

On Friday, Virginia’s Republican Party said that the picture was “unforgivable” and made reference to the abortion controversy.
“Given his statements on the right to life coupled with the most recent revelations, he has lost the moral authority to continue to govern and should resign immediately,” the party said.

"On Tuesday, actress Lauren London opened Instagram the same app where she first connected with her partner, Grammy-nominated rapper Nipsey Hussle, more than five years ago and shared a series of photos. Theres one of London embracing Hussle, a wide smile bringing out her dimples. In another, a grinning Hussle lifts his young son high in the air.
I am completely lost, London wrote in the posts caption, her first public statement since Hussle, 33, was shot to death Sunday in South Los Angeles. Ive lost my best friend My sanctuary My protector My soul.... Im lost without you We are lost without you babe I have no words.
The emotional post came just hours after authorities announced the arrest of Los Angeles resident Eric Holder, 29, who is suspected of killing Hussle and injuring two others. LAPD chief Michel Moore told reporters Tuesday at a news conference that police believe the shooting was the result of a personal matter between Hussle and Holder.
In the aftermath of the shooting, amid the flood of tributes to Hussle from Los Angeles city officials, celebrities and fans, there were countless messages of condolence directed at London. The pair have been together since 2013 and share a son, whom they raised alongside a daughter and another son from previous relationships.
By early Wednesday, the 34-year-olds Instagram post had nearly 3.9 million likes and more than 380,000 comments, with celebrities such as Alicia Keys, Jennifer Lopez and Janelle Monáe offering their support.
Soulmates forever! Keys wrote on Instagram. We are all Sending you, your babies and your family the brightest most protective and loving collective unified light beautiful sister.
Lopez commented that she was praying for God to give you and your family all the strength you may need during this time.
In another comment, Monáe wrote that Hussles energy and spirit will always be with London.
We are all here for you sis, the singer wrote. Wrapping our arms around you and your beautiful family. We love you.
For many social media users, Londons message reopened the wounds left by Hussles death.
That Lauren London post hurt me to my soul man smh

Ive thought about Lauren London almost everyday. I sincerely cant imagine the pain she must feel.
— Jackie Hill Perry (@JackieHillPerry) April 2, 2019
Their relationship started with a direct message on Instagram.
Our stories are very different, London told GQ in February when she and Hussle were featured for this years Power Couple issue. I did not slide into his DMs. My homeboy did....
In an interview last year with Boom 103.9 Philly, Hussle refused to reveal what the contents of the messages were, only noting that they went a long way.
Rewind to 2013. Hussle, who was continuing his slow but steady ascension in the rap world, had just dropped his eighth mix tape, Crenshaw, and was selling limited-edition copies for $100 each. London, then a series regular on the hit BET show The Game, wanted to buy the albums for her co-stars, GQs Mark Anthony Green reported.
London started following Hussle on Instagram. He followed her back. A modern-day love story blossomed, Green wrote.
In a GQ Couples Quiz video uploaded to YouTube last week, the pair revealed that they met for the first time in person at Hussles clothing store in South Los Angeles. The rapper was outside the store Sunday when he was shot.
[Suspect in fatal shooting of rapper Nipsey Hussle captured in California, authorities say]
What did I think of you? London asked Hussle, one of 30 questions she posed to the rapper as part of a challenge intended to see how well he knew her. (Hussle got 24 answers correct).
I thought she was head-over-heels committed and ready to roll, Hussle said in the video, prompting swift denials from London.
I thought he was very tall, she said, smiling.
Together, according to GQ, the couple was redefining what a storybook romance looks like in 2019.
But just a few years into their relationship, London told GQ she was faced with a life-altering choice between her family and her career.
The actress, a Los Angeles native like Hussle, had first appeared in music videos for artists such as Pharrell Williams and Ludacris before landing her breakout role in the 2006 film ATL. Following a successful run on the TV show, The Game, which ended in 2015, London was handpicked by director John Singleton to star in his new crime drama series, Snowfall, Hussle told GQ.
She read, got the part, shot the pilot ... did stunts ... this was her dream role, Hussle said.
Then London found out she was pregnant with Hussles baby. Without pressure from Hussle, London said she passed on the role. Snowfall, now on FX, is in its second season.
Do I choose my soul or myself? London said. I went with my soul.
The couple welcomed a son, Kross Asghedom, in 2016 the newest addition to their family, which already consisted of Londons son with rapper Lil Wayne and Hussles daughter from a past relationship.
Beyond being celebrated for his music and his dedication to improving his community, Hussle was remembered as a loving father. In one photo shared Tuesday by London, Hussle and Kross were all smiles as they snuggled together.
Krosss first words were da da, London said in the YouTube clip. As of early Wednesday, the video had been watched more than 7 million times.
On Tuesday, tributes to Hussle continued.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti described the rapper as an artist who touched our city and the lives far beyond.
He was a tireless advocate for the young people of this city and of this world, to lift them up ... by not being imprisoned by where you come from or past mistakes, but the possibility of what comes in the future, Garcetti said during Tuesdays news conference.

"The signature market turbulence of the past several weeks resumed Friday as stocks bobbed up and down before sliding deep into losses by the end of trading.
U.S. stocks rebounded briefly after comments by a Federal Reserve official eased investor worries that the central bank was locked into raising rates in 2019. But an hour later, the Dow had given most of that up.
Then the political gridlock in Washington put the market in a downward spiral, as President Trump held fast on his demands for more border security funding and Democrats resisted, and the government moved closer to a shutdown.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 414 points, or 1.8 percent, and closed at 22,443. The Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index fell 2.1 percent. And the tech-laden Nasdaq was off 3 percent.
The so-called FAANG stocks were again wreaking havoc on the Nasdaq. Google parent Alphabet was down 3 percent, Amazon down nearly 6 percent, Facebook down more than 6 percent, Netflix 5.5 percent and Apple was in the red less than 2 percent.
Technology is part of the same story as the overall market, said Scott Wren, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The market is fearing a global slowdown and is still worried about the Fed, even though they dragged Williams out to try to cushion what Chairman Powell said on Wednesday.
Technology has been in the headlines with regulation and privacy concerns, Wren said. And we have technology companies that led on the way up, so it makes some sense that people are taking some money out of their winners.
In the morning, the Dow had jumped nearly 400 points after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told CNBC that the Fed would pay close attention to the economy as it considered raising rates in the future.
We are listening. There are risks to that outlook that maybe the economy will slow further, Williams told Steve Liesman on CNBCs Squawk on the Street.
[Federal Reserve cuts its outlook for U.S. economy; stocks plunge]
Investors initially liked Williamss comments. The Dow was up more than 1 percent, a brief respite to a week that put markets on pace for one of the worst months and quarters in recent memory. The Dow also got help from athletic wear giant Nike, which crushed earnings expectations.
By early afternoon, the Dow and Standard &amp; Poors 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq had all turned negative.
Fragile markets continue to react to a flood of news, from rate increases to plunging oil prices to an impending U.S. government shutdown. Stocks are in the midst of their biggest weekly decline in nine months.
Its wearing, to say the least, and certainly not good for investor confidence, said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. The market volatility is being driven by computer algorithm trading programs that instantly buy or sell everything, depending on the news they are getting fed. Theres too much news.
[Trump orders major military withdrawal from Afghanistan as Mattis departs]
Asian and European markets were mostly down Friday, still reeling from the effect of Wednesdays U.S. Federal Reserve announcement that it was lowering its 2019 growth forecast from 2.5 percent to 2.3 percent. The Fed boosted interest rates up a quarter-point to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, the highest rate in more than a decade.
New Commerce Department data released Friday showed the U.S. economy slowed more than expected in the third quarter, although the economy still appears to be robust. Gross domestic product, a metric that measures all goods and services produced in the United States, increased at 3.4 percent annually, down from the 3.5 percent estimated in October.
The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 stock indexes are on pace for their worst month since 2009. All three indexes are headed for their worst annual drop in a decade.
The Dow has fallen 10 percent from its September peak, wiping out all gains for the year.
[Mattis resigns after clash with Trump over troop withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan]
Although it has pulled out of correction territory for the year, the Dow is still down nearly eight percent this year. The S&amp;P is down more than eight percent in 2018.
The Nasdaq is nearing a bear market, which is a 20 percent decline off its recent high. The tech-heavy index is down nearly seven percent for 2018.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said at a news conference Wednesday that the economy remains healthy and solid and that he did not see any reason to sharply change the Feds path of gradually pulling back support for it. But he acknowledged the economy is showing signs of softening and that there is a fairly high degree of uncertainty about what the Fed will do.
Stocks have also been down on Powells new conference, where he made it clear that the Fed will not shape monetary policy to support stock prices.
Yardeni said Fed officials need to get on the same page.
Williamss calming words just demonstrate that the stock market has an unhealthy addiction to monetary policy, Yardeni said. Yesterday, investors were disappointed by Powells press conference suggesting that monetary policy remained locked on a course of raising interest rates. Today, Williams said they will reassess in the new year.
The Fed has done a pretty bad job of communicating their intentions, Yardeni added. If they would just stick to the script that monetary policy is data dependent, without any set course, that is the message the market wants to hear.
Stocks sank nearly 500 points Thursday on the news that President Trump would not sign the spending bill that would avert a partial government shutdown Friday night.
Also lurking are growing concerns about a slowdown in the global economy. Those worries are reinforced by a 30 percent-plus decline in world oil prices since October.
Oil prices continued to drop Friday as new reports show demand for the commodity is dropping in high-growth economies such as India and China.
Capping the tumult was the White House announcement Thursday afternoon that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, considered a rock-solid stabilizing force in a frenzied administration, had resigned. Mattis cited differences over Trumps decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria.
John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial, said the flurry of news is taking its toll on nervous investors, even though the overall economy is good.
Theres just confusion from the Fed, investor sentiment is fragile, and with the government shutdown, add the Mattis resignation, and its been a parade of concerning news that increased investors anxiety Thursday, Lynch said.
LPL Financials outlook for 2019 is 6 percent to 8 percent growth in corporate profits and U.S. economic growth between 2.5 percent and 2.75 percent.

"LONDON (Reuters) - A “wall of money” is set to flood into emerging markets assets now the U.S. Federal Reserve has eased the risk of a sharp rise in global borrowing costs, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said on Thursday. 
The IIF, which closely tracks financing flows, said its high frequency indicators were picking up a “sharp spike” of inflows following last week’s confirmation of a change of tack from the U.S. central bank. 
“Recent events look likely to restart the ‘Wall of Money’ to Emerging Markets,” IIF economists said in a report. 
They said the money was likely to flow in broadly, although it could have the biggest impact in places like Brazil and Russia where investors had been giving a wider berth. 
“The hunt for yield will put positioning front and centre,” the economists said, adding that in contrast to Brazil and Russia, South African assets had been heavily bought up already. 
Emerging markets have overcome a brutal 2018 with a blistering start to this year. 
The premium investors demand to hold EM government debt rather than ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries has dropped around 100 basis points, while the MSCI EM stocks index has charged up more than 10 percent. 
The MSCI index this week scored a rare ‘golden cross’ where the 50-day moving average overtakes the 100-day moving average, something seen by keen chart watchers as a positive signal for things to come. 
“Up until recently, it had been the case that China was driving much of the pick-up (in EM flows), but the picture has broadened out in recent weeks, especially where equities are concerned,” the IIF said 
“(Extrapolating) the year-to-date flows to a quarterly frequency shows that Q1 is tracking around $48 billion, a number that is already equal to strong EM inflows in 2017 and likely to go higher,” it added.

"NEW YORK - Commuters beware: New York's and Washington's clogged streets and creaky subway systems are about to feel more pain as 50,000 more people descend on the two metro areas where Amazon will open new headquarters. An expansion of that scope in a city such as New York -- where the regional subway, bus and commuter lines move more than 8 million people every day -- sounds like something a transit system should be able to absorb. Not so, some experts say. ""Congestion will get worse. Buses will probably get a little bit slower. There are going to be more people traveling at a specific time of day to a specific place,"" said Eric Guerra, assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania. ""But at the same time, they will create a lot of jobs where people are."" Long Island City, the New York City neighborhood that will be home to one of the new headquarters, sits across the river from the busy world of midtown Manhattan. The growing area is crisscrossed by subways and buses and surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The other headquarters will be in the Washington suburb of Arlington in northern Virginia, a part of the country known for its mind-numbing traffic. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices. Still, the complaining has already begun. Among the sticking points: Amazon has won the rights to a helipad at its Long Island City location, allowing some senior executives to get through rush hour in style, though the company had to agree to limit landings to 120 per year. ""For the city and state to greenlight a helipad for the wealthiest man in the world and one of the richest corporations in the world is a slap in the face to all New Yorkers, but particularly the people in Queens who have to fight to get on the 7 train in the morning,"" said City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents Long Island City. ""And furthermore, if there were 25,000 to 30,000 Amazon employees in Long Island City, that fight to get onto the train is going to get a lot more intense."" Rising commute times Frustration levels already are high among New York City subway riders. More than a quarter of residents spend more than an hour getting to work, and 57 percent ride public transit to commute, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A key subway line that runs through Long Island City has been often criticized for delays, though long-awaited upgrades to allow trains to run more frequently are on track to finish as soon as this month, and a new ferry connection to Manhattan opened in August. Still, Van Bramer insisted the area isn't sufficiently well served, and there are complaints about noise pollution from helicopters and sea planes. ""The entire city is in a mass transit crisis, and nothing that I've seen about this deal makes me think it will help,"" New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said at a press conference Wednesday. ""Western Queens transit infrastructure is already strained, and the 7 train in particular is a mess every morning, so this definitely adds to existing transportation concerns."" New York City commuters have been clamoring for subway improvements for years, and some on Wednesday tweeted photos of packed subway stations near Amazon's proposed new office and reported having let several overcrowded trains go by before they were finally able to squeeze into one. Still, some see the dire warnings about New York's transit system as premature. ""Even as stressed as our system is right now, an investment in growth of this magnitude doesn't overwhelm the transportation network because it's such a robust and large system,"" said Tom Wright, president and CEO of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization. Frequent fires Washington, D.C.'s subway system, which will serve Amazon's headquarters in Arlington's Crystal City, is at capacity on many lines and has serious maintenance problems, said Tom Rubin, a transportation consultant based in Oakland, California. Repair work to the subway station closest to Amazon's new office resulted in a disastrous commute last week as people missed flights and stood in long lines for buses that never arrived, said Thomas Cooke, professor of business law at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. Fires have broken out so many times in Washington's Metro system that a developer created a Twitter account to automatically tweet suspected fires in stations. ""We have an embarrassing Metro system here that I hope will benefit by this relocation,"" Cooke said, adding that taxpayers will be footing the bill for the transit improvements that Virginia agreed to in its deal with Amazon. Development along major highways in Northern Virginia and Washington have led to ""unreasonable traffic delays on a daily basis"" in the past few years, with drive times that used to take 40 minutes ballooning to up to 90 minutes, Cooke said. In the nation's capital, more than a third of commuters ride public transit, and most spend at least a half-hour getting to work, according to the Census Bureau. Commuters in the suburbs surrounding Washington face even longer commute times. Private transit Elsewhere, companies use van pools and private buses to entice talented employees who want to live in hipper neighborhoods away from their offices. Google and Yahoo began running private buses from downtown San Francisco and elsewhere to their headquarters in Silicon Valley more than a decade ago. In the Los Angeles area, Disney, Nickelodeon and Warner Bros. run shuttle buses to carry employees from public transit stations to their Burbank studios, said Keith Millhouse, a transportation consultant and principal at Millhouse Strategies. Some hoped Amazon would invest in transit upgrades as part of the deal.

"Flood, snow, avalanche and fire alerts popped up Monday from Idaho to Colorado, as parts of the U.S. interior that were paralyzed by blizzards and floods last month braced for round two of an unusual weather phenomenon involving what's known as a ""bomb cyclone."" Welcome to springtime in the Rockies and parts of the Great Plains.
It's not unusual for floods, snow and fire to co-exist in the Rockies thanks to powerful storms blowing through the mountains, melting snow swelling waterways and high winds sweeping across dry grasslands and trees that haven't seen their first green shoots and leaves. What is unusual is a storm system that is moving in from the Pacific Ocean and forecast to intensify and form into a new inland bomb cyclone.
A bomb cyclone is a rapid drop in air pressure — at least 24 millibars in 24 hours — and often is over or near oceans or seas because it requires warm moist air smacking into cold dry air, along with volatile weather from the jet stream. The central and mountain parts of the country may get one of these every few winters, said Greg Carbin, forecast branch chief for the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.
But this would be the second such storm in less than a month. A March 13 storm caused massive flooding in the Midwest, a blizzard in Colorado and Wyoming, and produced winds between 96 mph and 110 mph.
This week's bomb cyclone is expected to be similar in intensity and in snowfall, meteorologists said. CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said on CBSN that it will become a ""monster storm"" when it hits the Plains.
""We're talking a blockbuster blizzard,"" Berardelli said. He expected it to start hitting the northern Plains on Wednesday and then slowly move across the region for at least two days.
Severe weather hits Texas
Heavy, wet snow will fall from the Nebraska panhandle through south central and southeastern South Dakota into western Minnesota. Wind speeds can reach 50 mph to 60 mph across Kansas.
""This blizzard will further exacerbate flooding in Nebraska with the added insult of heavy snowfall to eventually melt,"" said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at the private weathermodels.com. ""This is more bad news for suffering farmers who are unable to flip the calendar on winter.""
But first, the storm is expected to cause flooding in Idaho and western Montana, and dump up to 2 feet of snow in the mountains of Montana and Wyoming as it moves in from the Pacific Ocean. Parts of Colorado that were under a fire warning Monday are expected to see snow and temperature drops of more than 40 degrees by Wednesday at the southern edge of the storm, meteorologists said.
The storm dumped rain on parts of Oregon Sunday and Monday as it moved inland, causing flooding that closed some schools in the central Willamette Valley and forced the release of water from dams. While it's unusual to see two consecutive inland bomb cyclones, it's difficult to pin the cause on climate change, Colorado state climatologist Russ Schumacher said Monday.
""I think it's an interesting question to ask whether there's some climate change fingerprint on this,"" he said. ""But it's a complicated puzzle to piece together.""
That includes what is happening as the storm forms over the Pacific Ocean, what happens once it's over land and what effect climate change may have on those variables. ""I'm not sure we have the answer,"" Schumacher said.
Typical conditions for the Rockies are what drove a wildfire Sunday on southeastern Montana's Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, where a house fire sparked a blaze that quickly burned through 1,700 acres of dry grass and trees. It forced evacuations Sunday in Lame Deer, a town of about 2,000 people that is the seat of the tribal government, before fire crews were able to contain it.
Also normal are the fire warnings issued for eastern Colorado on Monday, a day after a wildfire near Colorado Springs forced the temporary evacuation of about 20 homes. Forecasters frequently issue red flag warnings for March and April on the eastern and southeastern Colorado plains as the jet stream moves southward and brings stronger weather systems and higher wind, said Jennifer Stark, meteorologist in charge for the National Weather Service in Pueblo, Colorado.
""This is the time of year when we get a roller coaster of weather,"" Schumacher said. ""Going from 80 degree temperatures one day to a snowstorm the next is not that out of the ordinary, especially in March and April, around here.""","Flood, snow, avalanche, fire alerts pop up as parts of U.S. interior paralyzed by blizzards, floods last month brace for round two of unusual weather phenomenon",2019-04-09T15:28:34Z,"Second ""bomb cyclone"" in a month brings threat of snow, flooding",CBS News,1
"BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.
""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.
The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.
As President Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""
EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.
Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.
""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.
In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.
But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""
In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site — which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts — but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.
At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.
In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.
With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.
But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites — lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities — that gets much of the attention.
Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.
""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.
For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.
At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.
Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.
In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.
The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.
During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.
The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.
Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.
Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.
Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" — a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.
The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""
In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""
Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.
""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

"The news media world was rocked Friday night when the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller disputed a bombshell report from BuzzFeed News that said President Trump had directed lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.
Late on Thursday, BuzzFeed ran with a report that cited two anonymous federal law enforcement officials, alleging the special counsel had evidence that the president directed Cohen, his former attorney and fixer, to lie to Congress about dealings regarding a potential Trump Tower in Moscow that took place during the 2016 election. According to BuzzFeed’s report, the sources said that the special counsel learned about Trump’s alleged wrongdoing “through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.”
TRUMP LAWYER DISMISSES REPORT ALLEGING PRESIDENT TOLD COHEN TO LIE TO CONGRESS
BuzzFeed reporters Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier doubled down on their reporting on Friday. Cormier went on CNN and stated that he did not see any of the evidence, but that the two unnamed law enforcement officials had. He called the article's sourcing “rock solid.”
Meanwhile, Leopold appeared on MSNBC and said “we’ve seen documents and been briefed.”
Asked by Mediaite to comment on what Cormier said on CNN, Leopold responded, “Yes. Anthony said HE had not personally seen the documents.”
However, in an unprecedented move, the office of the special counsel released a statement that pushed back hard against BuzzFeed’s reporting.
“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, &amp; characterization of documents &amp; testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,” special counsel spokesman Peter Carr stated.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith responded to the statement from the special counsel, tweeting this: “We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he's disputing.”
There has been a strong reaction from journalists and media watchdogs. CNN’s crime and justice reporter, Shimon Prokupecz, for instance, stressed that no one should “underestimate” the special counsel’s statement.
""I'm sure it pained them to do this. I’m sure it went through many levels at the DOJ and FBI. They don’t talk. This is massive,” Prokpecz tweeted.
The Hill media reporter Joe Concha pointed out how both reporters went on cable news with conflicting statements on their sourcing.
“One went on CNN this morning and said he hadn’t seen the evidence cited in the story. The other went on MSNBC and said both reporters had seen the evidence, so somebody is lying,” Concha told Fox News.
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow, whose work has been a key element of the #MeToo movement, weighed in on BuzzFeed’s disputed report, telling his Twitter followers that he himself declined to run with elements of what he described as a “narrative.”
“I can’t speak to BuzzFeed’s sourcing, but, for what it’s worth, I declined to run with parts of the narrative they conveyed based on a source central to the story repeatedly disputing the idea that Trump directly issued orders of that kind,” Farrow said.
Jon Levine, media editor for The Wrap, tweeted that “it’s clear” that based on the special counsel’s statement, BuzzFeed’s story was “not ready for the wall-to-wall cable news coverage it received.”
Offering bigger-picture context, Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that “no one hurts journalism more than journalists” and President Trump “scores big” when the media runs with inaccurate reporting.
“America has never seen anything like this. All the media errors are always anti-Trump. That's not a bug, it's a feature. That's what happens when the press stops trying to report fairly and becomes a bunch of lefty activists,” Gainor said.
Daily Caller media editor Amber Athey expressed a similar sentiment, saying that BuzzFeed’s story is “the latest in a long line of bad reporting on the Russian collusion investigation.”
“Journalists are so desperate to pin crimes on the president that they have no sense of skepticism when it comes to this story. The media should’ve had a wakeup call when CNN falsely claimed that [Anthony] Scaramucci was under investigation, but instead they keep relying on the same untrustworthy leakers and thus keep getting burned,” Athey told Fox News.

"Hours after the Senate voted down a disaster relief package that Democrats argued didnt include enough money to help storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, President Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to hit out at the opposition party and the islands leaders.
Trump, who has reportedly said in private that he doesnt want another single dollar going to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria, again complained about funding for the island and called San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, a frequent critic, crazed and incompetent.
The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any place in history, Trump tweeted around 11 p.m. The people of Puerto Rico are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt.
[Massive disaster relief bill stalls in Senate over Puerto Rico dispute]
Trumps late-night outburst suggests there wont be an easy resolution to the political dispute holding up federal money for those deluged in Midwestern floods and hit by other recent natural calamities. While disaster relief is traditionally bipartisan, Trumps reluctance to pay more toward Puerto Ricos recovery has opened a gulf between the parties.
On Monday, Democratic leaders balked at the $600 million for Puerto Rican food stamps in the $13.45billion package, arguing it wasnt enough. But Republicans refused to back a Democratic House bill that failed to account for the historic Midwestern flooding, as it passed before that catastrophe. Democrats have said they support paying for flood relief and attempted Monday to amend their House bill with that money, a move the GOP blocked.
In his tweets, Trump raised a familiar, contested figure for disaster relief in Puerto Rico. Although the president has repeatedly claimed that $91 billion has been spent there, that figure actually reflects a high-end, long-term estimate for recovery costs; a fraction of that has so far been budgeted, and even less has been spent.
[Heres why Trump says Puerto Rico is getting $91 billion in disaster relief]
The president also took aim at Cruz, San Juans outspoken mayor who has often taken Trump to task over a botched federal response to Hurricane Maria, which killed 2,975 on the island.
FEMA &amp; the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health, he tweeted. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!
Cruz quickly hit back, arguing that Trump was using inaccurate data.
Pres Trump continues to embarrass himself &amp; the Office he holds. He is unhinged &amp; thus lies about the $ received by PR. HE KNOWS HIS RESPONSE was innefficient at best, she tweeted. He can huff &amp; puff all he wants but he cannot escape the death of 3,000 on his watch. SHAME ON YOU!

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who has lately taken a more aggressive tone toward Trump, also pushed back and argued that the president was neglecting American citizens on the island.
Mr. President, this place you refer to, #PuertoRico, is home to over three million proud Americans that are still recovering from the storm and in need of federal assistance, he tweeted. We are not your adversaries, we are your citizens.

As The Washington Posts Erica Werner and Jeff Stein reported, theres no clear path forward for the disaster relief package after Mondays impasse. Trump seems unlikely to back more money for the island beyond the $600 million in food stamp aid, while Democrats are insistent that the bill include greater relief.
American children and families reeling from natural disasters deserve a Congress and a president who will ensure they have every resource needed to fully recover and rebuild their lives and communities, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) argued in the New York Daily News over the weekend.","Trump hits out at 'crazed and incompetent’ Puerto Rican leaders after disaster bill fails The Washington Post Dems playing politics with disaster relief funds for Midwest, Republicans say Fox News GOP disaster relief bill fails to advance in Senate NBC News T…",2019-04-02T08:56:22Z,Trump hits out at 'crazed and incompetent’ Puerto Rican leaders after disaster bill fails - The Washington Post,The Washington Post,0
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE Dec. 9, 2018 / 5:35 PM GMT By Emmanuelle Saliba, Euronews and Linda Givetash PARIS Graffiti and broken windows were the only remnants Sunday of the violent protests that have roiled Paris in recent weeks. As residents of the City of Lights were returning to their daily routines, however, France's finance minister warned that the demonstrations will have catastrophic effects on the country's economy in the long term. Bruno Le Maire visited business owners and walked by the shattered windows of a bookstore one day after riots brought the typically bustling city to a standstill on Saturday. The finance minister told Euronews these events will have negative implications on the ""attractiveness of France"" for business. The demonstrations, led by the so-called yellow jacket protesters, saw an estimated 10,000 people flood the otherwise deserted streets of Paris with another 125,000 demonstrators marching around the country, according to government officials. Over 1,300 people were arrested on Saturday while 135 were injured, 17 of whom were police officers. It follows weeks of demonstrations triggered by a proposed gas-tax hike and have come to represent general dissent against President Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms. ""It is really up to every citizen now to be aware that we need now to come back to peace and dialogue,"" Le Marie said. ""Because we won't find a long-term solution to this crisis without coming back to the table and having a dialogue."" However, Macron is facing mounting criticism for not speaking publicly in more than a week, all while violence worsened. Le Maire said the president is due to make a statement in the coming days. For some, that may be too little too late. Hes not saying anything and the countrys on fire, Meredith Saban, 38, a director of a human resources firm told NBC News during Saturday's protests. ""Hes mocking the people."" Macron has faced demonstrations since his election in May 2017, but the ""Yellow Jacket"" protests represent a more fundamental challenge to his authority with many people supporting the movement calling for his resignation. A November poll found that only 26 percent of French people have a favorable opinion of their president. The young centrist was elected to office on a reformist agenda, having pledged to overhaul the country's generous welfare state, which redistributes wealth across society with high taxes for the rich. France has high levels of social security and workers' rights, making it difficult to enact business-friendly reforms in spite of persistent unemployment. Despite the fanfare around his election, Macron has since struggled to pass legislation at the heart of his domestic agenda.

Eric Feferberg / AFP - Getty Images Last week, he attempted to quell the recent uproar by agreeing to drop the gas tax increase that was aimed at reducing Frances dependence on fossil fuels. Truckers called off a strike that was suppose to take place Sunday night after unions were reassured by written commitments from employers and the government on overtime pay. The earlier concessions did not seem to appease many recent protesters. The value of the damages from Saturday's demonstrations have yet to be tallied, but demonstrations over one weekend in Paris last month will cost the city more than $1.1 million, the deputy mayor had said. It was followed by protests last weekend that left the Arc de Triomphe tagged with graffiti. Le Maire said the bill will have to be picked up by the government, the public and insurers. ""These protests had a significant impact on the economy,"" he said Sunday. Meanwhile in Washington, President Donald Trump, tweeted in apparent support of the protests, saying it was ""time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement"" aimed at curbing climate change. The Paris Agreement isnt working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting We Want Trump! Love France. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2018 In another tweet, Trump suggested that protesters had chanted ""We Want Trump!"" although there has been no evidence to support the claim. France's Interior Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told French news broadcaster RTL on Sunday that Trump should stay out of their politics. The French don't weigh in on American domestic politics and U.S. officials should do likewise, he said. Reflecting on the protests, Le Drian said it reveals a profound sense of inequality among the public and Macron needs to consider establishing ""a new social contract.""

"The weather people claim March 1 is the start of meteorological spring. But March 1 arrived Friday and this alleged, conjectured, hypothesized meteorological spring was a no-show.
Dare we say, it flaked on us.
Much of the continental United States is cold, wet and stormy, with the notable outlier of South Florida, where it has been summer for many weeks.
A brutally cold Arctic air mass invaded the nations midsection this weekend and sent temperatures to levels normally associated with January. The nations official low temperature at midday Sunday was a nippy minus-44 F. in Mosby, Montana. The National Weather Service warned that temperatures between Montana and Kansas could be 50 degrees below normal.
Meanwhile a fast-moving storm system has swept west to east across the country. The system incited severe thunderstorms, flash flood warnings and tornado watches in the Deep South on Sunday.
Officials in Lee County, Ala., reported that at least two people had died during the severe weather, in which pounding winds, rain and tornadoes downed power lines and damaged buildings. Search and rescue teams were scouring the damage Sunday evening for other possible deaths or injuries.
At the same time, prodigious amounts of snow began falling in West Virginia and other parts of the central Appalachians as the storm system rolled northeast across Pennsylvania and toward New England. Officials in Philadelphia, New York City and Boston prepared for a disruptive blast of winter weather, along with possible power outages and air traffic delays.
Boston, which was buried in more than 100 inches of snow four years ago but largely has been spared this year, could see six to eight inches of wet snow before the storm races into Maine and then enters the Canadian Maritimes.
The District remained in its familiar, awkward position Sunday, close to the rain-snow line, with every possibility still on the table rain, sleet, snow, a major snowfall, a dismaying wintry mix, or just a mild dusting that nervous school officials would surely decide was apocalyptic. On Sunday, the Capital Weather Gang reported that precipitation types may alternate.
It was raining in downtown Washington, while the precipitation was frozen to the citys northwest; residents in Frederick, Md., were still expecting four to eight inches of snow.
The Arctic blast in the nations midsection is a repeat of what happened in January, when the polar vortex the very cold air mass that normally circulates in the Arctic broke into pieces, with a fragment hurtling south and creating dangerously cold conditions in the Lower 48 states.
The quirky behavior of the polar vortex is caused by a dip in the jet stream and is associated with a warm air mass that pulsed north into Alaska, said Jason Furtado, an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.
Whatever the precise cause, the timing is unfortunate.
I think people this year are less prepared for this kind of cold wave, and especially in some areas where things started to bud and blossom, Furtado said.
In addition to being cold and stormy, America is dismayingly soggy. Tennessee, for example, is the land of flooded basements. And the big storm is sending more water down the dangerously swollen Mississippi River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in recent days has diverted water from the river to ease the flooding hazards in New Orleans and other downstream cities.
Greg Carbin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said February set a record in the continental United States for the proportion of the country that received more than 10 inches of rain. That is a huge amount of rain in just four weeks, and by his tabulation, 5.5 percent of the country reached or exceeded that mark.
He noted that the records date only to 1969, but it is remarkable that the past three Februaries have been historically very wet.
His summation of the weather now: Its wet and miserable.

SUBSCRIBE Nov. 11, 2018 / 3:10 PM GMT Imagine flooding a desert half the size of the Sahara. Using 238 trillion gallons of desalinated ocean water to do the job. Creating millions of 1-acre-square micro-reservoirs to grow enough algae to gobble up all of Earths climate-changing carbon dioxide. For an encore: How about spreading the water and fertilizer (the dead algae) to grow a vast new forest of oxygen-producing trees? A Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Y Combinator, unveiled the radical desert flooding plan as one of four moonshot scenarios that it hopes innovators will explore as potential remedies to catastrophic global warming. But would it work? And should it even be tried? With unlimited capital and political will both far from given experts said the scheme would stand a chance of reducing dangerous greenhouse gas levels. But while they generally believe the climate crisis has become severe enough to push even extreme options onto the table, the experts cautioned against interventions that might create as many problems as they solve. We do not want to have this be purely profit driven, said Greg Rau, a University of California, Santa Cruz climate scientist and part of the team that helped Y Combinator craft the request for proposals. We are trying to benefit the planet, not just make money. So we need this kind of research and development first, but then oversight and governance over how any of this is deployed. The Y Combinator proposal grows out of what is now the consensus of climate scientists that humanity needs to move beyond slowing the production of carbon dioxide and begin removing excess levels of the gas already straining Earths atmosphere. The startup accelerator that helped finance Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit asked innovators last month to come forward with specific proposals on desert flooding and three other extreme plans for reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. The existential threat posed by climate change requires research into solutions that the investment firm itself conceded could be risky, unproven, even unlikely to work. Y Combinator said it had a rush of interest in its challenge. It declined to say how many took up the desert flooding option. But Sam Altman, Y Combinator's president, predicted that in 2019 his firm will fund three companies to pursue the Plan B climate solutions. A host of scientists who have studied Earths ecosystems, climate change and bio-engineering said further exploration might be warranted. But they were quick to cite many reasons that desert flooding is not likely to succeed. Massive size Y Combinator called filling 1.7 million acres of arid land with 2-meter-deep pools of water the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken. Just to pump ocean water inland and desalinate it would require an electrical grid far greater than the one Earth now devotes to all other uses. Its a desert for a reason, said Lynn Fenstermaker, a research professor at Nevadas Desert Research Institute. Flooding the desert and then keeping the water there, in an already water-poor area with all the evaporation, is hard to imagine. Y Combinator doesnt deny the magnitude of the challenge. Economies of scale as well as breakthroughs in material science and construction technology will all be necessary for success, its proposal says. Unprecedented cost Y Combinator pegs the price tag at $50 trillion. Thats roughly half the entire globes economic productivity for a year. Altman said in an interview that the cost for any solution will need to drop into the billions to become more realistic. You can do a lot of things that require spending more money than you will ever be able to get, Altman said, and it just doesnt come. Brought to a more realistic price, he believes that governments will pay. Destruction of unique ecosystems Many species would be wiped out by massive man-made flooding of deserts. People think there is nothing valuable in the deserts, but that is far from the truth, said Henry Sun, a microbiologist and research professor at the Desert Research Center. These diverse species deserve, and need, the desert to survive. Most of the worlds countries would set a high bar, Sun said, before destroying habitat. Potential for making things worse Interfering with nature can have unexpected consequences. Katherine Mackey, a University of California, Irvine climate scientist, noted how Australia has long tried, and failed, to combat overpopulation of native species by introducing non-native creatures. Famous case in point: toads were introduced in 1935 to tame sugar cane-eating beetles. But the toads couldnt climb sugar cane. So the beetles thrived, alongside their new neighbors an out-of-control toad population. Saying that we intervened and created a problem with global warming, so lets further intervene, thats not the thing to do, Mackey said. Thats not how you fix the problem, by replacing it with another problem. Distracting from more workable solutions Climate scientists believe that most, if not all, the needed solutions for limiting new greenhouse gas emissions and reducing current CO2 concentrations already exist. Environmentalist Paul Hawken has catalogued solutions in his Project Drawdown. Taken in total, Hawken has said, they would reduce emissions and sequester enough carbon to more than meet the goals laid out by world leaders in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Among the carbon-sinking projects that would require little or no new technology: creating new forests in degraded pasture, farm and other land; criss-crossing fields with trees to create so-called silvopastures, which absorb far more carbon than open fields; and preserving and restoring peatlands, the boggy wetlands that store carbon at twice the rate of the worlds oceans. I think its far easier to, for instance, make our houses better insulated and solar powered, than to flood deserts. Also, from a timescale perspective, how quickly will this technology be available at scale? said Mathis Wackernagel, president of the Global Footprint Network, an Oakland, California-based sustainability think tank. If we want to solve climate, why not bet on the easy stuff? The case for a moonshot Altmans answer is that he and Y Combinator already support, and fund, pragmatic green energy companies. But big reductions in greenhouses gases are still needed and dont appear to be coming quickly enough, the firm said. Y Combinator suggests that flooding the deserts may be less risky than another solution on its list fertilizing the oceans with massive amounts of iron or other nutrients to spur the growth of CO2-gobbling phytoplankton. Compared to ocean phytoplankton seeding, doing so in desert reservoirs reduces systemic risk and exposure of the marine ecosystem to our widespread meddling, Y Combinators request for proposals says. The window for easy solutions is already closed. Doing nothing is guaranteed suicide, the firm said. Altman, 33, added: All of this stuff is scary. However, runaway global warming where we all die is also quite scary....None of this is where we would like to be. But here we are. Activists and scientists interviewed by NBC News said exploration of far-out solutions is warranted as long as researchers, governments and funders dont lose focus on other fixes. The concern I have is that Silicon Valley seems very excited about these moonshots, when maybe what we need is a bunch of Boeing 737s, said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a clean energy think tank and lobbying organization. And to do it on a 10- to 15-year development cycle, not one that takes 30 years.

"PALM BEACH, Florida (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pledged investment in a rare meeting on Friday with five Caribbean leaders who have sided with the United States in backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as head of state, the White House said. 
Trump met with leaders from the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and Saint Lucia at his private club in Palm Beach, Florida. 
He promised them that a high-level delegation from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. development lender, would visit their nations in the next 90 days, the White House said. 
“It’s absolutely important that it’s not just talk - that there will be real investment,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters after the meeting. 
The nations have broken from other members of the Caribbean Community, known as CARICOM, in their support for Guaido. The organisation has officially advocated for talks between President Nicolas Maduro and Guaido, and most of its members have rejected resolutions by the Organization of American States supporting Guaido. 
The backing of the five for Guaido led to the meeting with Trump, though the White House did not specifically tie the carrot of investment to that support. 
Guaido, who heads Venezuela’s national assembly, invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency in January, saying Maduro’s election last year was not legitimate. Maduro, who still has the support of Venezuela’s military, has clung to power with the support of Russia, China and Cuba. 
The Caribbean region has long relied on oil and gas from Venezuela, which offered cheap financing through a programme called Petrocaribe, though shipments have declined in recent years because of production problems at Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. 
The region has also been the recipient of a flood of investment from China. The White House said earlier this week that Trump wants to work with leaders to “counter China’s predatory economic practices.” 
Trump and the leaders did not discuss Chinese investment issues, Holness told reporters.

"Guerneville, Calif. — The body of a man who was swept away by a flood was found Thursday in northern California. Farther south, in Sonoma County, the Russian River flooded roads, leaving people trapped. Just after sunrise, people woke up to see one of the only roads out was still completely submerged in water.
By midday, the river had receded more than three feet, just enough to allow a few vehicles back into tiny Forestville that had been cut off for 36 hours. Now, emergency responders, fire Capt. Michael Franceschi among them, have to figure out if everyone is safe. He said they rescued 40 people on Wednesday.
There's no telling how bad the damage will be in the long river valley that runs through a dozen towns from California's wine country to the Pacific. At its worst, the Russian River flooded 13 feet above its banks, cresting at 45 feet.

"The three Venezuelan migrants eke out a living 90 seconds at a time in a busy intersection of Peru's capital. When the traffic light flashes red, the acrobatics and break dancing starts. With a captive audience of pedestrians and commuters packed inside city buses, the dancers' headstands, dizzying spins and fast-paced steps on a good day net up to $20 in pocket change nearly three times the monthly minimum wage in Venezuela. It also earned them a brush with a Hollywood superstar Angelina Jolie. ""You never know how it will go in the street,"" said dancer Karin Rojas. ""One day it's good and the next day it's bad."" The trio is just part of a flood of Venezuelans fighting for survival after fleeing their homeland and the worst economic crisis anybody in Latin America can remember. Most Venezuelan migrants head to neighboring Colombia, overwhelming border towns. They hawk their valuables on the street, sell hotdogs or repair shoes. Farther-off Peru is the second-most-common destination. Rojas, 25, and her husband, Francisco Diaz, arrived in Lima in 2016, leaving behind their mountainous home in the Venezuelan state of Merida, where they ran a break dancing collective. In Peru, they met the third partner, Angel Fernandez, a short and stout 22-year-old from their home state. The three settled on a busy intersection in Lima to perform. Six days a week, they bound into the intersection with each red light an exhausting 80 times over a 13-hour workday. They end some days just $5 richer, and hurting physically. The sun cooks the asphalt. Their palms are covered in calluses and fingers sometimes bleed. Rojas says her bones ache and her head throbs. Still, Rojas said, their life is better than in Venezuela, where she would go two days in a row without eating. Now, she can afford three meals a day. Their dancing also caught the attention of Jolie in October, when the American actress visited Lima as a special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Their moves impressed Jolie, and she told them not to give up their dreams. Rojas and Diaz hope to parlay earnings from their street dancing into buying a three-wheel motorcycle taxi, a common form of transportation in Lima's poor outskirts.

President Donald Trump has been briefed on a plan that would use the Army Corps of Engineers and a portion of $13.9 billion of Army Corps funding to build 315 miles of barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the briefing.
The money was set aside to fund projects all over the country including storm-damaged areas of Puerto Rico through fiscal year 2020, but the checks have not been written yet and, under an emergency declaration, the president could take the money from these civil works projects and use it to build the border wall, said officials familiar with the briefing and two congressional sources.
The plan could be implemented if Trump declares a national emergency in order to build the wall and would use more money and build more miles than the administration has requested from Congress. The president had requested $5.7 billion for a wall stretching 234 miles.
Under the proposal, the officials said, Trump could dip into the $2.4 billion allocated to projects in California, including flood prevention and protection projects along the Yuba River Basin and the Folsom Dam, as well as the $2.5 billion set aside for reconstruction projects in Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria.
Senior Defense Department officials discussed the proposal with Trump during his Thursday flight to the southern border, according to officials familiar with the briefing.
Trump was informed that the Army Corps could build 315 miles of border wall in about 18 months, according to officials familiar with the planning. The barrier would be a 30-foot bollard-style wall with a feature designed to prevent climbing, the officials said.
The Corps would focus first on the heavily trafficked border areas along the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, in San Diego and El Centro in California, as well as Yuma, Arizona.
The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.
A source on Capitol Hill said if the president moves to pull money from Corps of Engineers civil works projects, Democrats in Congress are likely to submit legislation to block the money from being reallocated.
Asked about the proposal, a Democratic staffer warned that taking money from civil works projects in the U.S. will put American lives at risk.
""Hundreds of thousands of people will be at risk if there is a strong or wet winter in these flood areas and the protection projects haven't been completed,"" the staffer said.

"Anthony Ruzicka, a fifth-generation Nebraska rancher, got the call at 6 a.m.: The nearby 90-year-old Spencer Dam was failing under pressure of a river swollen with snowmelt and rain. He got out with moments to spare but the wall of water swallowed up many calves and all his bulls, along with his farmhouse, outbuildings, feed bins, and the original log cabin built when his family came from Czechoslovakia to homestead in the 1860s.
Ruzicka was luckier than most caught in the historic floods across the Midwest. The day before, he and his neighbors in Verdigre, in the northeast corner of Nebraska, had chased most of his herd of 300 cattle a half mile to higher ground, just in case. He doesnt yet know his total fatalities, but on Saturday alone he saw 15 carcasses.
And losing so many calves and bulls? Calves represent next years cash (it takes 12 to 18 months to reach slaughter weight) and bulls represent genetic material that may distinguish the quality of a herd from someone elses.
Im 39 years old; I dont have children. The cows are my children, and my farm is completely destroyed. Maybe its a sign from God to go and do something else, Ruzicka said.
Even before the bomb cyclone and last weeks floods, the farm economy has been terrible, Ruzicka said. Most ranchers he knows are doing their best to break even, working 100-hour weeks and getting up every two hours to check the cows.
Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said its too early to provide a definitive estimate of the damage, but some early estimates put ranching losses in the state at $500 million and row crops in Nebraska, that is largely corn, soy and, to a lesser degree, wheat at another $400 million.
For livestock, the loss is a combination of animal deaths and loss of productivity (when its cold, cattle and calves dont grow as fast) as well as loss of quality feed sources. For row crops, Nelson explained, farmers are very close to planting season, and fear they wont have enough time to clean up the land.
Estimated losses include cleanup costs as well as late planting, Nelson said.
Those cleanup costs could be substantial, according to John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. As big a threat as all that river water is, its also what in the water that is concerning.
The water is chock-full of stuff. This is a toxic brew that is going down the river the water took out gas stations and farm shops and fuel barrels. The Platte, the Elkhorn and their tributaries are bad, as well as on the north end where the dam broke, now weve got four or five rivers that have set all-time records for the highest theyve ever been.
Ice caused some of the worst damage, Hansen said, causing choke points at bridges and temporary dams that forced the melting water over river banks and onto the roads, stranding farmers, ranchers and their livestock.
The states National Guard has been airlifting hay and animal feed to marooned ranchers and farmers, and state authorities have set up a livestock shelter at a fairgrounds in Lincoln.
But Amy Dickerson, managing director of the Lancaster Event Center, said many farmers couldnt get their animals to shelter because so many roads and bridges were out.
We dont have one single cow, horse or llama here yet. Weve had two false alarms with 20 horses in Waterloo stuck in a barn with water up to their bellies. People have been visiting them by boat, bringing feed. We got a call that 17 of them were headed my way, but they may be headed to another barn.
Dickerson said theyve been swarmed with volunteers and have begun functioning as a clearinghouse, connecting people who have animal feed with those who need it. The offer of feed doesnt do much, though, once floodwaters have ravaged a ranch.
People are absolutely losing their herds, said Dickerson. You can see floating black dots in pictures on Facebook.
For ranchers and farmers in the northern part of the state, the worst may be over, the floodwaters receding. But saturated earth also brings rot, mold and other challenges, according to Hansen.
We have some small towns along these rivers that are just going to be devastated. How do you identify needs beyond keeping them alive? And now all of this water is moving south. Hello, Kansas City.
Kyle Tubbs in Craig, Mo., about 90 miles north of Kansas City, hauled all 400 of his hogs to higher elevations on Saturday afternoon, losing only one animal in the transition. The only building on his farm not underwater is his house, which he raised nine feet after the floods of 2010 and 2011. Tubbs is four days into this flood, the third in 10 years, and he said its far from over.
Theres such a volume of water up in the Dakotas, well be battling this all summer. Our rivers are managed so terribly.
He worries he wont be able to bring his animals home for months, and theyll be kept at a temporary facility with no running water and no farrowing facilities for pregnant sows to give birth which could lead to further losses.
Hes reduced to using his boat for transport. When he looks out to the south, all he can see is water.

"CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Thousands of people displaced by California’s most destructive wildfire, including hundreds living in tents and cars, face heavy rains next week that could trigger dangerous floods and mudslides, while helping douse the flames. At least 300 people who fled the Camp Fire were sheltering on Friday in the flood-prone parking lot of a Walmart in Chico, about 15 miles (24 km) west of where the blaze consumed the mountain town of Paradise on Nov. 8. More than 1,000 are missing, according to police. The remains of at least 71 people have been identified so far. A rain storm is forecast to hit next week and so authorities are asking people to leave the Walmart lot by Sunday afternoon, said Bryan May, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Hillsides that have been scorched by a wildfire are at risk for mudslides when it rains, experts say. The flames burn away vegetation that holds the soil in place and bake a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking more than a few inches into the ground. Authorities say they have enough shelter space to provide a bed for everyone who wants one, but they acknowledge challenges ahead in finding more long-term housing for the displaced. May said it was not clear exactly how many people are in need of housing, but at the height of the Camp Fire authorities had ordered more than 52,000 people to evacuate. A survey found only 100 housing units available for rent in all of Butte County, where the fire has been burning, May said. Already, more than 1,100 people are bunking at shelters in the area, according to the Red Cross, and countless more are staying with friends and family. The fire forced caregiver Robin Tompkins, 43, and her family from their home in the town of Magalia, north of Paradise. Friends let them stay for a week, but now the family needs to find other accommodation, she said at an evacuee relief station in the Chico Walmart parking lot. Her husband Timothy, who works as a cook at a Chico cafe, was frustrated by the lack of information about how long he might be kept from returning to Magalia. “I keep hearing different things: a month, four months, a year. We just want to get home,” he said. Randy Greb, 61, was camping in a tent in the parking lot after his home in Paradise was destroyed. “I lost everything. I’ve got the clothes I got, but people have been nice and really helping us,” Greb said. “Everybody has been doing their best.” The Walmart tent village is the largest of several outdoor encampments of refugees from the Camp Fire. Some displaced people prefer to remain outdoors because they want to stay with their pets, which many shelters say they cannot accept, or are concerned about losing their privacy, May said. But authorities are encouraging them to camp near a shelter so they can access services for hygiene and other needs, such as free diapers and Clorox wipes. Given the shortage of suitable housing, attention has turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It has said that it is working with state and local officials to evaluate options, and is considering using travel trailers to house some of the displaced. Last year, after a deadly wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Santa Rosa, FEMA trailers were used to house some of the displaced. Among the thousands who have applied for help from FEMA is Linda Harned, 63, a retired caregiver who lost the home that she shared with her husband and several relatives in Magalia. “I’m depressed and upset,” Harned said at the relief station outside the Walmart in Chico. “It’s hard. I never knew how much I loved my house.” Reporting by Terray Sylvester; Additional reporting and writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Nick Zieminski","Thousands of people displaced by California's most destructive wildfire, including hundreds living in tents and cars, face heavy rains next week that could trigger dangerous floods and mudslides, while helping douse the flames.",2018-11-17T14:31:53Z,Rain storms could bring more misery for California fire evacuees,Reuters,0
"(Adds background) LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Chinese copper smelter Jiangxi Copper and miner Antofagasta have agreed 2019 copper treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) at $80.80 a tonne and 8.08 cents a pound, three sources familiar with the matter said. This is the first major deal for the coming year, which typically sets the benchmark for the sector. The charges agreed between Jiangxi and Antofagasta are down from the 2018 benchmark of $82.25 a tonne and 8.225 cents a pound. Miners pay the TC/RCs to smelters to process their concentrate into refined metal, offsetting what the smelters pay the miners for the concentrate. No one at Jiangxi Copper or Antofagasta was immediately available to comment. TC/RCs typically fall when concentrate supply declines or smelting capacity rises, with the level agreed playing a large role in the profitability of both sides. China is bringing on a lot of smelter capacity next year, just as a flood of mine supply funded during the boom years starts to subside. The nation is the world’s largest consumer of copper. The fall marks a fourth consecutive drop in the annual TC/RC benchmarks since it was agreed at $107 a tonne for 2015.

When Americans imagine creating conditions for female success in the workplace, paid maternity leave is often high on the priority list.
This thinking, however, is outdated and wrong. Gender-equal paid leave not only gives all parents the opportunity to care for and bond with their children it helps ensure that women reach their full potential and creates the conditions for a more equitable, prosperous world.
In the #MeToo era, many ask why American sexual arrangements are so strained. One key reason is an antiquated division between men and women that begins at birth. From the cradle, men are conditioned to associate nurturing and care with female figures and to devalue the unpaid work that women shoulder disproportionately. This normalizes and sustains gender inequality in a way that hurts everyone: mothers, fathers, children and society as a whole.
In the #MeToo era, many ask why American sexual arrangements are so strained. One key reason is an antiquated division that begins at birth.
The United States is one of only a very small handful of countries in the United Nations that lacks a national paid parental leave law putting it in the company of countries like New Guinea, Lesotho and Suriname. According to PL+US: Paid Leave for the United States, a non-profit advocating for paid family leave, a quarter of new moms in the U.S. return to work 10 days after childbirth. For men, that figure is 70 percent a situation not only unhealthy for child development, but reinforcing of old-fashioned gender roles.
The good news is that several states, including California, Rhode Island, New Jersey and New York, are now leading the way to change the harmful notion that caregiving is primarily a womans responsibility. Its time for the federal government to get on board with an equitable, paid family leave policy.

So why is it still so hard to see fathers as equally responsible for the early care of children? Part of it has to do with a quirk of human evolution. A baby guinea pig is born open-eyed and ready to walk, and a newborn blue wildebeest can outrun a hyena within a day. The human infant, in contrast, is born helpless. A baby needs constant supervision and strong caregiver investment.
Even among primates, the human baby is an outlier. A human fetus would have to gestate for up to 21 months to reach the developmental stage of a newborn chimpanzee. With its large head encasing a supersized brain, the human baby is born at an early stage of development: Otherwise it couldnt squeeze through the birth canal.
So why is it still so hard to see fathers as equally responsible for the early care of children? Part of it has to do with a quirk of human evolution.
For much of human history, the birth mother has born the brunt of infant care because it is she who gets pregnant and breastfeeds this helpless creature. The cultural biases of patriarchy have tended to designate women as primary caregivers and secondary human beings.
Starting with the Industrial Revolution, however, when women began to work in factories, old sexual arrangements began to change. This trend accelerated with advances in family planning technology and the flood of women into the workforce during World War II. Womens liberation movements pried open previously locked doors of human endeavor, from university education to political participation to paid work once considered the sole domain of men.
Today, the human female is no longer condemned to a constant state of pregnancy during reproductive years and burdened with the care of a steady stream of infants and young children. She can be a full participant in all aspects of society, including the job market.
Yet the American workplace remains trapped in the past. Todays families rely on the income of both parents and require the caregiving investments of moms and dads. While birth mothers need to recover physically from the impact of pregnancy and delivery, caregiving and bonding are critical activities for all parents, whether kids are biological offspring, born through surrogates or adopted.
Limiting the participation of men in early childcare actually mirrors the historic exclusion of women from participating in work outside the home. Not long ago, many considered it unnatural for women to work in an office or manage a career.
That prejudice has faded. But men, in contrast, are still commonly considered less naturally equipped to care for young children. Sociologists call this trained incapacity. In other words, men are seen as less able to care for babies because traditionally they have not been required to do it. Yet the rise of stay-at-home dads, who have doubled in number since 1989, proves that guys have plenty of caregiving capacity. Many feel fulfillment and pride in using it.
Right now, the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 guarantees 12 weeks of job-protected time off equally to many American moms and dads. The upside is that the policy treats both parents the same. But the harsh downside is that the leave is unpaid and unaffordable to most but the affluent. Men, in particular, are less likely to take leave that is unpaid to care for children. The law also does not even apply to many types of employees, including the growing cohort that works 25 hours or less.
The American public wants paid leave for parents not just for moms. Polls show that the majority of both Democrats and Republicans support it. But business lobbies, with their deep-pocketed influence on politicians, have stood in the way of progress.
Some companies try to respond to modern conditions. Many others, however, have adopted primary-caregiver policies that recall the Mad Men era.
Some companies try to respond to modern conditions. Many others, however, have adopted primary-caregiver policies that recall the Mad Men era, when men were assumed to have few, if any, nurturing responsibilities. This reinforces an outdated homemaker/breadwinner model that carves out different identities and possibilities for men and women.
Companies with such policies are now under legal fire. Just ask JPMorgan Chase, the subject of a discrimination charge filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a male employee who received a mere two weeks paid leave while mothers received 16. Or, Estée Lauder, which is paying $1.1 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allowing only women to claim primary caregiver status and providing fathers with less leave and fewer benefits.
Can businesses afford to give men equal paid time off for children? The answer is yes. In 2004, California implemented a paid family leave policy, and studies now show that the change has had a neutral or positive effect on productivity, employee morale and turnover. Paid leave abuse has also been found to be rare.
Research shows that when dads take time to care for infants, moms can get back to work sooner and even earn more, thus helping them to progress in their careers. In addition, having fathers take part in early childcare may ultimately help reduce the gender wage gap.
Some companies are figuring out that providing equal leave is both good for employees and signals social responsibility. Etsy, for example, now allows six months of parental leave for each parent, to combat the unconscious bias against women and mothers in the workplace. Other companies, including American Express, Bank of America and Twitter have rolled out gender-blind policies.
Way back in 1976, Dorothy Dinnerstein, a feminist psychologist, wrote a classic book, The Mermaid and the Minotaur, arguing that excluding men from the care of babies is detrimental to human relations and has the pernicious effect of alienating men from their human nurturing capacities. If men shared equally in caregiving responsibilities, Dinnerstein showed, they would likely be less hostile to women and value the opposite sex more fully.
America has some serious catching up to do on equitable parental leave. Fortunately, we can learn from experiments undertaken in other countries. Some Scandinavian countries, for example, have extended maternity leave to long periods without allowing fathers equal time which can have a negative impact on female careers and the hiring of women. Thats why countries like Iceland and states like California and New York have decided to simplify things with policies that treat parents equally.
In the 21st century, both men and women are needed in the workplace and the nursery. When the male hand rocks the cradle, too, the whole world wins.

There are people in this world who enjoy cleaning, and prefer to do it the old-fashioned way, and bless them. For the rest of us, housecleaning is a chore to be gotten through with the minimum time and pain required. We've embraced and for most of us, count as indispensable conveniences like dishwashers, but the world of cleaning shortcuts doesn't stop there.
How do you know though, which products and tools are truly time savers, and which should remain on infomercials for purely entertainment purposes? I'm always on the hunt for things that will trim minutes from the time it takes to clean my rambling old Victorian, but not everything is worth the expense, or the cost to the environment.
For insight, I talked with Rachel Hoffman, author of ""Unf*ck Your Habitat: You're Better Than Your Mess"". But let's deal with something first. Somehow, sometimes, shaming comes into play when it comes to cleaning shortcuts. And it has absolutely no place here, Hoffman said.
Whether it's robot vacs or cleaning wipes, there's a stigma about using these things and it's unnecessary, she said. It's a matter of saving time. We don't berate ourselves for saving time in other ways.
Take washing machines, she said. We're not down at the river with a washboard cleaning our clothes anymore. It's about incorporating some kind of technology or innovation that benefits you. It's silly that we have shame about this. It's not hurting anyone. It's not at the expense of someone else. It exists to make things easier and better for you.
Cheating is in the eye of the beholder
Is it cheating to let a robot clean up the dog hair, or to use a Swiffer instead of hauling out a mop and bucket?
Some folks think so. When I took to social media to ask friends and acquaintances for their favorite cleaning shortcuts, among the flood of great tips I was reminded by some of the value of elbow grease. One responded with the definition of impetus: ""The force or energy with which the body moves"". In other words, just do the work. No secrets.
That's great, but life has a way of preventing elbow grease or impetus. Like many other families, my partner and I both work full time and have side hustles and projects. Also like many, I contend with chronic back pain, and a few other things that make cleaning more taxing. If I have to use a cleaning wipe instead of elbow grease and a cleaning rag to tend to messes, so be it.
If it's financially feasible and it's going to make your life easier or better in some way, remove the shame, Hoffman said. There's no sense in being embarrassed or thinking you have to do everything by yourself the hard way in order for it to count. What counts is if it's clean, not how it gets there. Also, she said, what's wrong with cheating anyway?
So then, if you're ready to 'cheat,' here's Hoffman's take and mine on whether popular shortcuts are cheatworthy.
These cleaning products get a thumbs up
Leave-on shower spray. I use Method shower spray religiously but never knew if it was doing anything other than leaving a nice smell. Yes, it smells good but it does do something, Hoffman said. Cleaners like this almost always have some form of cleaning agent, usually very diluted so you don't have to rinse, she explained. It helps keep soap scum from forming which helps deep cleans go faster because the dirt is not adhered. While actual scrubbing is certainly more effective, she said, these products come in handy.
Robot vacs. As a dog parent, her robot vac is indispensable, Hoffman said, and they've become accessible for more consumers. I've noticed the last five years they've come down [in price] considerably, she said. I recently upgraded from an early robot vac model that randomly bumped around the house to a newer model, and forget the Kondo method this is some life-changing magic. You can run it from your phone (or Alexa); schedule cleanings for when you're not around; set cleaning zones, like just the kitchen; and mark no-go zones. When it's done it sends a report showing what's been cleaned. It's removed the need to run a real vacuum in our house, a chore that took an hour-plus so if there were one shortcut I wouldn't give up it would be this.
Dusting wipes and Swiffer dusters. I use and I love Swiffer dusters and they're super great, Hoffman said. I haven't found anything that's quite as effective. To get the same level of dusting you need to take out the can of Pledge and dusting cloths and it's a time thing. I like Clorox dusting wipes but they both achieve the same result, which is to condense the effort. (Buy the multi-box so you can keep a pack in several parts of the house and grab one when you're on the phone or have a minute to spare, and you can make dusting something you sneak in over time rather than the one big chore it can be otherwise).
Dry Swiffers. Does it seem like Swiffer has overtaken the cleaning aisles to you too? They're everywhere. In the Swiffer family of things I absolutely adore Swiffer dry floor cloths, Hoffman said. I'm with her. I find that after a vacuum and mop I can still pick up dust and hair with a quick run of the dry Swiffers, so I buy them by the bale at Costco.
Skip these products
Glass cleaning wipes. I feel like the old fashioned way [with window cleaner and paper] is both more effective and equally as convenient, Hoffman said. We both find the wipes streak, and since you spend more trying to get results, I don't feel I get a time savings, she said. She's had luck with some microfiber cleaning cloths; the key, she said is using smooth material, not nubby, so look for the word ""smooth"" in reviews.
Stainless steel wipes. Same as the glass wipes, they tend to streak and defeat the purpose of trying to save time.
Wet Swiffers. Whether it's the wet cloths or the Swiffer Jet, they're not effective, and floor ends up sticky, Hoffman said. I've found the same. Instead, if I'm looking for an alternative to the bucket and mop, I love the O-Cedar Microfiber Spray Mop. It's barely even considered a convenience product, Hoffman said, since the pad is washable and you can make your own solution.
What about disposable toilet cleaners?
I'm an admitted toilet-germ-phobe, and dislike the thought of swirling the same brush around a toilet over and over, so use the Clorox ToiletWand. This isn't really saving any time, Hoffman pointed out. Squirting a cleaner into the bowl and grabbing a brush doesn't really take any longer, she said. You're basically doing the same amount of work. I feel like the old fashioned brush you get more scrubbing power with. She also cautioned that people often assume all products like these are flushable when in fact they're not. (And even those that say they're flushable you want to be sure are compatible with your plumbing.)
Some people just absolutely cannot touch anything having to do with the toilet, Hoffman said. We're sometimes a little bit precious about certain types of germs [even though] there's basically fecal matter on everything in your bathroom if you flush with the toilet lid up. If you're in that toilet-cleaning-avoidance camp, like me, If you find a solution that helps you get it done, by all means, use it, she said.
(Also, she blew my mind with this tip that may just send me back to the old school brush. It's already in a sanitizing solution in the toilet with the cleaner, Hoffman said, so when you're done, rinse it in clean toilet water then let it dry between uses: stick it between the lid and seat cover with the brush over the bowl till it dries. Boom, no more fecal matter soup for the brush to swim in, and you're still not touching anything!)
These convenience items come at price in more ways than one
About that nagging feeling that we're being wasteful with these conveniences? Well, we are. You can't really ignore the fact that there is an environmental impact ... they do end up getting thrown away, Hoffman said. I'm of two minds. If it helps you to do the task then it's valuable. If it's a matter of 'I'll use a Clorox wipe to wipe down my bathroom counter or not do it at all,' it's worthwhile to have. You can also be conscious about reducing waste elsewhere to help offset the waste, she said, and look for biodegradable products. I use Green Works Cleaning Wipes for quick touch-ups between more thorough bathroom cleanings as my own compromise.
At the end of the day, Hoffman said, it's all about making ourselves more likely to just do the things, so we need to find the trick that works for us. That may be buying the products that smell the best, or that remove some steps. If it's something you can do just really quickly and not put it off, she said, there's your value in those convenience items.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal law enforcement agencies that keep Americans safe are starting to feel the strain of the U.S. government shutdown, in its 21st day, with agents working for no pay and investigations delayed, law enforcement officials said. 
Training events have been canceled and travel cut back, with President Donald Trump and Congress unable to end the partial shutdown affecting a quarter of the government in a funding standoff over Trump’s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. 
“We still have a responsibility for going after those who might be using this time to flood the streets” with drugs, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) field agent told Reuters, asking not to be identified by name. 
“For us, it’s even a more important time to try to target as much as we can. We still have a safety obligation to the public ... with the limited resources,” the agent said. 
Most employees at federal law enforcement agencies - from the FBI and DEA to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Transportation Security Administration - have kept working since Trump’s demands on the wall triggered the shutdown on Dec. 22. 
“Non-essential” personnel across the government have been staying home on furlough, while “essential” personnel, which includes many in law enforcement, have been working for no pay. 
On Friday, many of roughly 800,000 shutdown-affected federal workers will miss their first paychecks. The shutdown began after Trump insisted that $5.7 billion for his wall be made a part of any legislation to restore funding for many agencies that expired for unrelated reasons, a demand Democrats oppose. 
As much as 85 percent of the Justice Department’s employees are working, as are nearly 90 percent of the Department of Homeland Security’s employees, said department spokesmen. 
“It really wears on our members,” said Nathan Catura, the national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents some 27,000 federal agents. 
“You feel like a pawn in this big political windstorm. You feel like you’re not worth anything,” he said. 
In a memo to U.S. Secret Service agents that was seen by Reuters, service Director R.D. “Tex” Alles urged employees to “keep an eye out for warning signs of trouble.” 
He wrote, “A quick internet search will validate that financial stress is often the precursor to greater issues, including depression, anxiety and worse.” 
While the lack of a paycheck is stressing out some agents, the shutdown has had a limited operational impact so far, several law enforcement officials said. 
Drug seizures are still occurring. Corrections officers are still reporting to work each day and air passengers are not yet facing overly long security lines in airports. 
But funding that law enforcement agencies draw on for investigations and some other operations is starting to dwindle. 
Interviews with witnesses in some DEA investigations have been postponed. Furloughs of some FBI analysts has forced agents to pick up the slack by doing their own background checks - a process that may slow them down, officials told Reuters. 
That means FBI agents doing anti-terrorism or white-collar crime investigations must pull together criminal records and other background materials on their own, without the help of analysts who specialize in such work, Catura said. 
“That slows everything down,” he said. 
FBI headquarters “is doing all they can” to ensure major investigations continue, said Tom O’Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association. The group on Thursday sent a petition to the White House and Congress urging them to end the shutdown. 
“FBI operations need funding. We’re beginning to raise concerns regarding field operations. Support operations are understaffed,” O’Connor said. 
Federal prison workers are also growing frustrated. Prior to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Prisons had to deal with a hiring freeze, followed by 6,000 job cuts. 
“The great majority of our federal law enforcement officers work in middle America,” said Eric Young, national president for the Council of Prison Locals for the American Federation of Government Employees union. 
“They are very conservative, and they were supportive of Trump. Some still are, but the great majority of them have been totally disenchanted with what they have seen from this administration,” Young said.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico Ramón Otero has worked toward improving his community of Parcelas Nuevas after Hurricane Maria left it almost unrecognizable nearly a year and a half ago.
Roads still in poor conditions need to be rebuilt some homes in communities like Jájome still have blue tarps, Otero told NBC News in Spanish. Almost all of Puerto Rico still has sectors that lack proper lighting.
But 2019 has emerged as a year of new possibilities for an island grappling with the deadliest natural disaster in the United States in a century, which killed at least 2,975 people.
In the town of Cayey, community leaders such as Otero have been doing their part: helping families whose homes were deemed uninhabitable find new places to live, and identifying people who were denied federal aid last year to fix their hurricane-ravaged homes.

Gov. Ricardo Rosselló promised that 2019 will be the year in which we build a new Puerto Rico.
We find ourselves in a frank recovery process in order to rebuild our island in a way thats well planned, that maximizes its potential, he said in his end of year statement in December 2018.
To fulfill such promise amid economic and political turmoil, officials need to find ways to secure the disbursement of critical federal housing funds, spend them appropriately to effectively rebuild the islands infrastructure and tackle issues such as informal or illegal construction and the increasing number of vacant properties.
When will people in the island see the assigned funds?
Progress in Puerto Rico has been relatively stalled since only a small fraction of the federally approved funds has been disbursed.
Congress appropriated at least $136.1 billion in disaster relief funds, according to an analysis from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies. While the money goes to an array of local and federal agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development are two of the most crucial agencies in the recovery process.
The federal government has disbursed more than $3.7 billion for FEMA to finance local government grants to complete debris removal, public infrastructure repairs and give direct aid to affected individuals, according to numbers provided by FEMA spokesman Juan A. Rosado-Reynés.
On Feb. 2, Rosselló announced HUD authorized the disbursement of the first $1.5 billion of a total of $20 billion granted through the agencys Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery Program for infrastructure repairs and rebuilding homes. Puerto Rico originally expected to receive part of this money in January, but thelongestgovernment shutdown in U.S. historydelayed the process. Some of the CDBG-DR funds are set to finance 28 programs in Puerto Rico, some similar to the one Annie Mayol runs.

Mayol is the president and chief operating officer at the Foundation for Puerto Rico, a not-for-profit organization based in the U.S territory that seeks to promote opportunities for social and economic development with the help of a network of smaller community groups. She recently partnered with Puerto Ricos Housing Department to create the first community-focused reconstruction program set to be funded with $37.5 million in CDBG-DR funds.
We think about resiliency in a more holistic way, that our communities have the resources to plan their own communities better,"" Mayol told NBC News.
Foundation for Puerto Rico would invest almost $500,000 per community to help them identify the main issues whether they are in the areas of housing, infrastructure, access to health services or economic development and eventually provide the resources necessary for sustainable solutions.
The programs first phase consists of field work and data research that could help communities identify risks.
These bottom-up efforts are key for long-term sustainable growth, Mayol said.

A decade long recession has left Puerto Rico unable to fund reconstruction projects on its own.
However, fulfilling these efforts are under threat since President Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding for Puerto Rico in multiple occasions.
On Jan 16, the Trump administration publicly opposed that Puerto Rico receiving $600 million for its nutrition assistance program, calling it excessive and unnecessary.
Reports that Trump could use $2.5 billion set aside to finance reconstruction projects in the island to pay for a U.S.-Mexico border wall surfaced earlier this year.
That is against the law,"" Puerto Rico Housing Secretary Fernando Gil Enseñat told NBC News. The funds were destined for [housing in] Puerto Rico.
Also, local officials point out, a federally-appointed oversight board monitors every single economic decision made by the islands government.
Rosselló said his administration would consider suing Trump if he redirects recovery funds to finance a border wall.
Fighting Trump's accusations that Puerto Rican politicians are trying to use the recovery money ""to pay off other obligations could lead to a conflict that might affect the disbursement of federally assigned funds in unpredictable ways.
Without an element of [economic] sustainability, any kind of infrastructure I put up wont be sustainable, Gil Enseñat said.
Although Puerto Rico has every right to receive already-assigned federal funds, economic sustainability to finance long-term reconstruction efforts is not just [bound to] federal money,"" said Mayol, who also emphasized that the private sector, philanthropic and other nongovernmental organizations have a role in securing Puerto Ricos financial future and help the island diversify its income streams.
Proving homeownership
Gil Enseñat said he wants to be able to replicate Mayol's community program in hundreds of neighborhoods across Puerto Rico. He also believes that the issue around lack of property titles is worth tackling promptly.
This first became a problem for residents when they tried to access FEMAs individual aid program to repair their homes after the hurricane.
At least 533,000 people, more than half of all applicants, were denied or deemed ineligible to access such program, according to FEMA numbers. Lacking property titles to prove home ownership under FEMAs standards was one of the main reasons why so many didnt get the help they requested.
Puerto Rico plans to implement a $40 million program to provide property titles to some of those who did not receive aid. For Gil Enseñat, providing this documentation also opens a pathway for the local government to better collect revenues through property taxes and enforce legal construction in the island.
The number of denied FEMA applications also highlights a bigger issue that has confronted the island for decades and was exacerbated by the hurricane a history of informal housing development and illegal construction.
Though there are no official government figures, conservative estimates suggest that around 260,000 houses in Puerto Rico were built without the appropriate legal documentation and permits, according to David Carrasquillo, president of the Puerto Rican Planning Society, a private entity that brings together urban development experts.
Previous estimates from the Puerto Rico Builders Association, an industry group, suggest that about 55 percent of the islands infrastructure more than half was informally built, including 700,000 houses and commercial buildings. This practice led many Puerto Rican families to pass down properties generation after generation without having a proper property deed.
But providing property titles to these residents won't fully solve the issue, Carrasquillo told NBC News. Other options should exist for residents to prove homeownership and legally access federal housing aid moving forward.
He said organizations such as Ayuda Legal Puerto Rico, a nonprofit that provides legal support to low-income communities, are proposing using a ""uniform document"" as an alternative to having a property deed.
""The federal legislation is clear: a person does not need to have a [property] title to access funds to repair their homes after a disaster, Ayuda Legal said in a statement.
So far, Puerto Rico's Housing Department has not responded to Ayuda Legal's proposal.
Advocates have also raised concerns over expropriation risks that could disproportionately fuel displacement among residents of informal communities, even if property titles are granted to them.
Laws in Puerto Rico allow the local government to take over private properties for public use in exchange for payment or compensation. But the definition of public use is so broad that the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit that monitors expropriation abuse, pointed out in a report that municipalities can take (and have taken) property for anything they deem a public purpose including shopping malls, restaurants and luxury housing developments.
Why not use vacant housing?
For Carrasquillo, ""the exorbitant amount of abandoned spaces is the most pressing housing issue in Puerto Rico.
According to a report from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, the excess supply of vacant homes in Puerto Rico is a clear impediment to economic recovery.
The number of vacant homes in Puerto Rico has been increasing since 2006. By 2016, 18 percent of the islands housing stock was vacant and a spike in foreclosures after the hurricane suggests that vacant units are increasing at an accelerated rate.
Authors of the report issued two recommendations. One is to turn vacant government-owned buildings, such as closed schools, into social purpose housing. Another is to implement a housing program that converts vacant units into affordable housing facilities to mitigate the endemic challenge of widespread informal housing not built to [legal construction] code.
But right now were going in the opposite direction, Carrasquillo said.
Vacant properties are only addressed once in the action plan from Puerto Ricos Department of Housing, which outlines how the government plans to use HUD funds. It says that the vacant units will be a primary line of action to relocate residents who live in flood zones or areas deemed dangerous.

"Margot Saunders is senior counsel at the National Consumer Law Center, specializing in federal law and policy that governs robocalls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) Thirty billion robocalls were made to American consumers in 2017, according to YouMail, a robocall-blocking service. And while robocalls, made with an automated dialer or using a prerecorded or artificial voice, torment Democrats, Republicans and independents alike, even on this issue, Washington leadership has found a way to divide along party lines. The division is not over whether robocalls generally are a nuisance that should be addressed, but over which robocalls should be stopped. The robocalling industry is pushing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deregulate all automated robocalls made with a human agent by interpreting the definition for ""automated telephone dialing systems"" (autodialers) in a way that would not cover any automated systems being used by the callers. Businesses using robocalls for debt collection and telemarketing are trying to capitalize on a recent DC Circuit Court decision that tasked the FCC with revisiting some of the rules that govern robocalls under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ). The TCPA requires that callers have consent when they use autodialers to call cell phones, and that consumers can revoke that consent to stop the robocalls. However, partisan lines have been drawn over whether some well-known companies, including many creditors and debt collectors, should be exempted from the TCPA's restrictions altogether. This would mean that consumers would no longer have the ability to stop calls from callers collecting debts -- regardless of how many times a day or a week the calls are made or whether they are even reaching the correct party. While some Democratic senators have opposed the loosening of regulations that would allow consumers to be inundated by these unwanted calls, Republicans have not taken action to stand up for consumers' rights. Congress passed the TCPA in 1991 to address a surge in unwanted robocalls and faxes. The FCC has interpreted the TCPA to bar unwanted text messages as well as autodialed calls to cell phones without the recipient's consent. But as the availability of software and equipment to make autodialed calls to cell phones rapidly expands, lobbyists and lawyers for the robocallers are in Washington, working to persuade the FCC to narrow the autodialer definition so that virtually none of the technologies currently used to make unwanted robocalls or send texts would be covered by these protections. Giving in to the robocallers' demands would inevitably increase the number of robocalls made daily, likely by a factor of thousands. There would simply be no restrictions whatsoever on debt collection calls, survey calls, political calls or non-profits calling to solicit money, so long as those calls are made using live agents or technology that does not fit into the proposed, narrow autodialer definition. While the Do Not Call Registry would still apply, that rule protects us from only telemarketing calls, which are less than half of all robocalls. The robocalling industry also hopes to persuade the FCC to strip consumers of their right to revoke consent. Frequently, consumers unknowingly consent to receive robocalls from companies they do business with in the fine print of loan documents, service contracts and consumer product terms and conditions. Once consumers recognize they've given a business permission to robocall them, usually after receiving a number of unsolicited robocalls, they now have the legal right to inform the business that its calls are unwanted and demand that the calls stop. As things stand, the robocallers have to comply, but with the stroke of a pen, the FCC may allow them to ignore consumers' wishes. Lobbyists for the businesses making robocalls don't appear confident in their own assertion that their calls are wanted communications between a business and its customers. If they were, they would support consumers' right to revoke consent -- assuming that their customers would not exercise that right. More than a dozen Democratic senators have urged the FCC to maintain strong rules to limit unwanted robocalls and allow consumers to determine which calls are wanted. But in a true display of Washington dysfunction, that letter is void of any Republican signatures. Worse, some Republican senators wrote to the FCC urging it to side with the robocallers at the expense of consumers. If Americans are to have confidence in the democratic process, lawmakers must find common ground on issues that directly impact their constituents. An issue as wide-reaching and universally despised as robocalls provides just the opportunity. Congress and the FCC should honor the will of their constituents and reject efforts by big businesses and robocalling industry lobbyists to flood our cell phones with even more unwanted robocalls.","Many businesses that use robocalling are hoping to capitalize on a recent DC circuit court decision that tasks the FCC with revisiting some of the rules that govern the practice, writes Margot Saunders",2018-11-10T02:02:02Z,Rules against robocalls shouldn't be loosened,CNN,0
"(CNN) Heavy rain this week could help quench the Camp Fire burning in Northern California, bringing with it an end to the threat of more wildfires this year but also new dangers. The rain will end ""fire concerns for the winter,"" Robert Baruffaldi, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service's Sacramento office told CNN Monday night. However, officials in Butte County are warning residents already devastated by the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history that rain arriving Wednesday could cause flash flooding and mudflows. The Camp Fire has killed 79 people, 64 of whom authorities have tentatively identified. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch from Wednesday through Friday for the Camp Fire area. On Monday, fire-weary residents in Butte County prepared themselves for potential flooding. Jennifer Debrunner, who is staying at the Butte County Fairgrounds in an RV loaned by a stranger, said her family has covered everything her family owns with a tarp. She told CNN affiliate KCRA-TV the rain will bring ""a lot of mud, a lot of cold"" but she's glad her family has the RV. Cady Machado told CNN affiliate KTXL-TV she's been staying in a Walmart parking lot with her husband and 9-month-old baby. Because of the incoming rain, Machado says she's sending her child to her sister's home in Arizona. She and her husband have other plans to stay safe from the elements, she said. ""There's a nice bridge with my name on it to go underneath where I won't get flooded out with my husband,"" she said. The Red Cross and other organizations have opened additional shelter buildings for people and pets in advance of the rain, KCRA reported. ""We want to make sure those people who are staying in tents know that these spaces are available for them so they can get out of the elements,"" Shawn Boyd with California's Office of Emergency Services told KCRA. Rain is expected to arrive in Butte County on Wednesday, bringing about an inch of rain to Paradise, the town virtually wiped out by the Camp Fire, Baruffaldi told CNN. Baruffaldi said the rain may cause ""ash flows."" A second rain system arriving Thursday night will bring 1.5 inches of rain to Paradise -- up to 4 inches in areas with higher elevation, Baruffaldi said. It has the potential to create mudflows, he said. Boyd told KCRA the rain could also help rescue efforts by ridding the air of dust. ""You get rid of the dust, these dogs have a better chance at pinpointing and following their nose to where there may be remains,"" Boyd said. As of Monday night, the Camp Fire was 70% contained and had scorched more than 151,000 acres. The fire also has destroyed more than 11,700 homes and torched an area the size of Chicago, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Fires raging across the state Rainfall is also expected in Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire burning west of Los Angeles has killed three people and torched more than 96,000 acres. The burn area is expected to receive less than an inch of rain bringing the potential for mudslides and minor debris flow from Wednesday afternoon through early Thursday morning, according to the NWS in Los Angeles. The Woolsey Fire is now 96% contained and expected to be fully contained November 22. Mudslides are more likely in the Woolsey Fire area because fires in the southern part of the state tend to destroy vegetation roots, Baruffaldi said. Almost 700 people are unaccounted for In Butte County, authorities are scrambling to find 699 people who are unaccounted for. That number keeps fluctuating as residents are located. ""That is raw data we're collecting from phone calls, emails and the 911 system,"" Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said. ""It's not perfect data, but our thought process is that it's better to get that information out to help start getting people accounted for. So rather than wait for perfection, we're trying to get some progress going."" Hundreds of deputies, National Guard troops, coroners and anthropologists are sifting through destroyed homes and scorched cars for human remains. With many retirees living in the Paradise area, officials fear the death toll could rise. Butte County is keeping a list of the people who are unaccounted for because of the Camp Fire. Honea urged anyone who sees their own name or the name of a loved one found safe to contact the sheriff's office. Lingering health hazards from the wildfires The wildfires will hurt the health of people who may never have seen the flames. Smoke from the Camp Fire hangs heavy in parts of the state, forcing schools to close and shutting down public transportation. The air quality is so bad that San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento became the world's three ""most polluted cities"" on Friday, worse than hot spots in China and India. People in these areas should minimize the amount of time they spend outside, experts say. CNN's Dave Alsup, Joe Sutton, Jen Christensen and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Heavy rain this week could help quench the Camp Fire burning in Northern California, bringing with it an end to the threat of more wildfires this year but also new dangers.",2018-11-20T09:31:28Z,"Rain in wildfire-scarred Northern California will end fire threat, bring new ones",CNN,1
"By Rene Marsh, Ellie Kaufman, Ross Levitt and Gregory Wallace, CNN Updated 2:37 AM ET, Tue November 27, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN) The lengthy National Climate Assessment released on Friday includes detailed information about how specific regions of the US will be impacted. Here's what else you need to know. -- There will be shorter winters and longer summers. -- There will be a decline of species that support some of the most valuable and iconic fisheries, including Atlantic cod, Atlantic sea scallops and American lobsters. -- Expect approximately 650 excess deaths per year caused by extreme heat by 2050 -- Health risks from contaminated flood waters. For example, because much of the historical development of industry and commerce in New England occurred along rivers, canals, coasts, and other bodies of water, these areas often have a higher density of contaminated sites, waste management facilities, and petroleum storage facilities that are potentially vulnerable to flooding. -- 61% of major citi es are exhibiting some aspects of worsening heat waves, which is a higher percentage than any other region of the country. -- Experts project the region will see the greatest increase in cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease. -- More people will die: Absent mitigation, ""an additional 200 to 550 premature deaths in the region per year by 2050. These account for almost half of the total projected deaths due to the climate-related increase in ground-level ozone nationwide and may cost an estimated $4.7 billion (in 2015 dollars)."" But under another scenario, ""by 2090, 2,000 additional premature deaths per year, compared to the base period of 1989-2000, are projected due to heat alone without adaptation efforts."" -- Food supply will suffer from declining crop yields and increasing pest problems: The area is home to nearly a quarter of US agriculture. Report cites increasing temperatures that lead to yield declines and ""increase the range and fecundity of crop pests."" -- Variety of health threats come from rising temperatures: Increasing ""heat illness and diseases transmitted through food, water and insects will increase as temperature rises."" Heat illness and stress is connected to a number of conditions, including ""lung disease,"" and increases the ""death rate for elders with chronic conditions."" -- More wildfires: The increased temperatures have intensified droughts in California and the Southwest region. Recent wildfires have made California ecosystems and Southwest forests net carbon emitters, meaning they emit more carbon into the atmosphere than they use. With increased greenhouse gas emissions, the report predicts that more wildfires will occur across the region. Under higher emissions, fire frequency could increase by 25% and the frequency of larger fires could triple, the report states. -- Sea level rise: The report estimates that sea level rise and storm surge could completely erode two-thirds of southern California beaches by 2100. Ocean waters have been warming. Off the coast of California and worldwide, ocean temps warmed by 0.6 to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit from 1971 to 2010, mainly due to climate change. Continued climate change effects could warm California waters by between 4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, according to the report. -- Increased temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions are projected to cause winter warming throughout the region, which could impact not only the environment but the economy of different states in the region. Warming will also impact fish populations that live in this region, which also would have a severe economic impact. Warmer winters in the region will lead to a reduction in the mountain snowpack, which will increase wildfire risk. Comparing high snowfall years to low snowfall years in the region between 1999 and 2009, each low snowfall year resulted in more than 2,100 fewer employees and $173 million reduction in ski resort revenues, according to the report. -- Ocean/water warming: Increasing ocean temperatures and acidity impact fish survival, the report states. As water temperatures continue to rise, negative impacts on fisheries are expected to increase. With increased stream temperature projections, the report predicts a 22% reduction in salmon habitat in Washington by the end of the century if emissions continue to release at a higher rate. That kind of salmon population loss would correlate to a $3 billion economic loss. -- Islands could shrink: ""Puerto Rico and the USVI are projected to lose 3.6% and 4.6% of total coastal land area, respectively. Were such a rise to take place, Puerto Rico's critical infrastructure near the coast would be negatively impacted, including drinking water pipelines and pump stations, sanitary pipelines and pump stations, one wastewater treatment plant, and six power plants and associated substations."" -- T he sta te is ""warming faster than any other state"" and ""twice as fast as the global average since the middle of the 20th century."" -- Devastating impact to fishing industry: Alaskan fisheries ""are among the most productive and valuable in the world."" A ""recent heat wave in the Gulf of Alaska, which led to an inability of the fishery to harvest the Pacific cod quota in 2016 and 2017 and to an approximately 80% reduction in the allowable quota in 2018."" Hawaii and Pacific Islands -- Flooding would be devastating, especially on low-lying islands: ""... Across the state, nearly 550 Hawaiian cultural sites would be flooded or eroded, 38 miles of major roads would be chronically flooded, and more than 6,500 structures and 25,800 acres of land located near the shoreline would be unusable or lost, resulting in approximately 20,000 displaced residents in need of homes."" -- Massive water shortages: Islands are extremely vulnerable to drought. ""Severe droughts are common, making water shortage of one of the most important climate-related risks in the region.""",The lengthy National Climate Assessment released on Friday includes detailed information about how specific regions of the US will be impacted.

"Paradise, California (CNN) Rescue workers on Tuesday combed through debris of a charred mobile home park in Northern California, searching for the possible remains of victims with urgency before the rains started. The window to recover any remains from Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, which was destroyed by the Camp Fire, is tiny. The heavy rains expected as early as Wednesday could drench the Camp Fire, which has burned for nearly two weeks. But the rains also may complicate the search -- packing ash, debris and dirt tightly and making it hard to find human remains. ""We're trying,"" said Brian Ferreira, a rescue squad officer with California Task Force 4, a Federal Emergency Management Agency urban search and rescue team made up of several Bay Area fire departments. ""We're just going to comb over the debris and the material as thoroughly as we can."" It wasn't immediately clear whether the Camp Fire killed any residents from Ridgewood. At least two residents are among the hundreds of Paradise residents still unaccounted for, according to CNN affiliate KRCR. The inferno has already killed 79 people, and officials fear the toll will rise. The blaze has destroyed nearly 13,000 homes. The team, which was deployed by state officials, focused on the mobile home park because it was a home to senior citizens, who likely had a hard time evacuating. They zeroed in on rubble of homes where there were burned cars driveway, or the roof was burned off, according to Ferreira. For more than two hours, they sifted debris with tools in areas where there were likely recliners and chairs. They looked in bathtubs and in the remains of bedrooms. ""Right now, the material is dry, so it gives us the ability to kind of sift through that, somewhat. And when with the rain comes, what should happen is it's going to consolidate that material and make it more dense and pack it down,"" said Ferreira, an Alameda County Fire Department captain. Ferreira said: ""It's going to make a difficult task even just that much more difficult."" Before the Camp Fire broke out early on November 8, Ridgewood was a 100-acre paradise in the city of Paradise. Pictures on Facebook showed neatly pruned hedges and white stones covering front yards. A charred stone bench, bird bath and ornamental angel were among the blackened survivors of the firestorm. A flash flood watch is in effect for Wednesday through Friday for the Camp Fire area, and 3 to 6 inches of rains are expected. About an inch of rain is expected in Paradise, a town north of Sacramento virtually destroyed by the Camp Fire. The rain could cause ash flows, or a slurry of ash swept away by rainwater, according to Robert Baruffaldi, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service's Sacramento office. A second rain system on Thursday night will likely bring 1.5 inches of rain to Paradise and up to 4 inches in places of higher elevation, he said. Mudflows are a real threat. The rains could also make conditions hard for firefighters battling the blaze, which has charred more than 151,000 acres. The California team has searched multiple areas in the past week looking at every home for possible victims, according to Oakland Fire Department Battalion Chief Robert Lipp, a program coordinator for the task force. ""We're just going to do the best we can,"" Ferreira said of their search at the mobile home park. Something caught their attention when several rescue workers arrived at one home with a burned car. They walked to the back, looking in piles of ash. They radioed an anthropologist. Minutes later, the anthropologist and several task force members stood side-by-side, hands on their knees, peering at the earth. The anthropologist shook her head. She declined to talk to a CNN reporter. ""She told us it's not human remains,"" Ferreira said. Paul Vercammen reported from California. Darran Simon reported and wrote in Atlanta.

"The Latest on the partial government shutdown (all times local):
8:10 a.m.
President Donald Trump is threatening to close the U.S. border with Mexico if Democrats in Congress don't agree to fund the construction of a border wall.
Trump tweeted Friday morning that ""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely,"" unless a funding deal is reached with ""the Obstructionist Democrats.""
Trump's demand for money to build the border wall and Democrats' refusal to give him what he wants has caused a partial government shutdown that is nearly a week old. Congress adjourned for the week without a resolution in sight.
The shutdown is idling hundreds of thousands of federal workers and beginning to pinch citizens who count on some public services.

1 a.m.
It's looking increasingly as if the partial government shutdown will be handed off to a divided government to solve. This, as agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power.
Now nearly a week old, the impasse is idling hundreds of thousands of federal workers and beginning to pinch citizens who count on varied public services.
For example, the government says it won't issue new federal flood insurance policies or renew expiring ones until the budget for them is restored.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN)Thousands of people have been left stranded on Thailand's southern gulf coast as authorities moved to suspend all flights and ferry services ahead of what could be the worst storm to hit the country in decades.
Tropical Storm Pabuk is expected to make landfall about 7 p.m. local time Friday (5 a.m. ET) near the Chumphon archipelago, on the eastern border of Thailand's Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces, but heavy rain has already arrived. 
Popular tourist destinations in the Gulf of Thailand, including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao islands, along with islands in the Andaman Sea such as Phuket and Koh Phi Phi -- made famous by the movie ""The Beach"" -- are expected to be affected by the storm during what is peak holiday season.
""It's quite scary being here because we don't know what's going to happen and there is no way to leave,"" American tourist Miranda Abidyer, 26, who is stranded on Koh Samui island, told CNN.
Abidyer, who traveled to the island with her young family to celebrate her husband's 30th birthday, said they had a flight scheduled for Friday but it was canceled and ferry services have also been suspended. She said they haven't received any information from local authorities about the storm or what they should do. The now plan to wait it out in their private villa, which is about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the beach. 
""We will hide in the bathroom if the storm gets that bad. But all we can do is wait,"" said Abidyer.
It is highly unusual for tropical storms and typhoons to make landfall in Thailand. The last time a tropical storm made landfall in Thailand was in 1962, when Tropical Storm Harriet impacted 12 provinces and claimed 900 lives. The only typhoon ever to make landfall in the Southeast Asian nation was Typhoon Gay in 1989.
District chief of Koh Samui, Kittipop Roddon, told CNN by phone Friday that there are about 20,000 tourists currently staying on the island, which is the second largest in Thailand. 
""The island is now totally cut off from the mainland, all kinds of transportation (to mainland) have been suspended since yesterday,"" he said, adding that there is enough food and supplies on Koh Samui to last through the storm. 
Those left are now preparing to ride out the storm, with residents on Koh Samui boarding up houses with wooden planks. By Friday, the roads on the island were quieter and store shelves emptier, witnesses told CNN.
But it's those on some of the smaller islands that could be the most vulnerable. The District Chief of Ko Phangan and the popular diving island of Koh Tao told CNN that he was concerned that any emergency rescue operations would be more difficult on Koh Tao due to its remoteness. He said 15,000 tourists remain on Koh Phangan and about4,000 on Koh Tao.
Thousands of residents living in coastal areas were evacuated to storm shelters on Thursday, according to Thailand's Disaster Prevention and Mitigation. Some 5,700 people were moved to safety in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, on the country's east coast, which is among the areas expected to be hardest hit by the storm. 
The agency's director general Chyapol Thitisa told CNN that for three days the army had been helping to evacuate those living in remote and coastal areas in the province and some coastal villages prone to storm surges have have been completely emptied. 
Thousands of tourists have also fled the islands, cramming onto ferries and specially chartered boats.
Nakhon Si Thammarat airport is currently closed and Bangkok Airways announced the cancellation of all flights to and from Koh Samui on Friday ""for safety reasons."" 
Thailand's Meteorological Department said the storm was 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, according to a 7 a.m. weather advisory on Friday.
Tropical Storm Pabuk is expected to bring maximum sustained winds of 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph) and torrential downpours. Strong winds on Thailand's Gulf coast, which lies directly in the path of the storm could bring waves up to 3-5 meters (10-16 ft), according to the Meteorological Department.
After crossing the Chumphon Archipelago the storm will, if the current track holds, make a second landfall over Surat Thani province early Saturday.
Pabuk will then move over the Malay Peninsula towards the Andaman Sea relatively quickly, but not before dumping large amounts of rain across the region.
The storm is expected to bring strong winds, high waves and surf along with surge, and heavy rain with flooding. While the winds, surf and surge will be dangerous especially, to an area not used to seeing these types of storms, the most significant danger is the rain and flood potential.
Areas in the southernmost portion of Thailand could receive well over 250mm (10 inches) of rain. There is also the possibility of mudslides from the Phuket mountain range on the western side of the peninsula.
The province likely to be worst affected is Nakhon Si Thammarat, where Harriet hit.
As the storm progresses out to the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal into next week it could become a problem for the coasts of Myanmar, Bangladesh or India.

"(CNN) She had pictured the trick plenty of times in her mind's eye and even tried it once onto an airbag but no woman had ever pulled it off on snow. Now, high on Austria's Stubai Glacier, snowboarder Anna Gasser gazed down at the huge white ramp that could propel her into history. Quiet in her helmet and dark goggles, Gasser contemplated her leap into the unknown. ""I'm thinking triple,"" she whispered. Specifically, she was thinking a cab triple 1260, a trick that involves taking off in the switch position -- the opposite direction of travel with your ""wrong"" foot forward -- before completing three-and-a-half full rotations and landing with your other foot in front. Pulling it off would require confidence, commitment, and a whole lot of bottle. ""For sure it was one of the craziest tricks I've ever done,"" the 27-year-old Austrian told CNN Sport. Staring down the run in, Gasser tried to flood her body with confidence. Naturally, though, nerves crept in. Her stomach churned, but she hopped forward on her snowboard and started speeding towards the giant snow ramp sculpted by machines. For sure it was one of the craziest tricks I've ever done. ""I had some butterflies in my stomach for sure before I dropped in,"" said Gasser, who won gold in the big air contest at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in 2018. ""There was not much going through my mind actually, I was just trying to trust myself and telling myself that I could do it. Other than that, I was just full-on focusing on what I wanted to do."" Gasser knew a big take off would be essential. A triple requires far more force and power than your average jump; complete commitment to the cause is key, because abandoning the trick midair can be treacherous. She sped up the steep ramp and launched into the Austrian sky. Once airborne, the feeling was like nothing she had experienced on a snowboard before. Gasser had made history before when she became the first female snowboarder to perform a cab double cork 900 -- two back somersaults and a horizontal spin, giving the effect of a corkscrew -- in November 2013. Now she was about to take the sport into another new realm. My heart was still racing and I had so much adrenaline. ""I had more physical power than I've experienced compared to another trick... There's so much more physics to jump up and spin that fast,"" says Gasser. ""As soon as I took off I knew there was no way back because when you initiate it you cannot open up anymore. It's maybe more dangerous than just going for it."" It was a trick so daring, so nerve-wracking, and so exhilarating, that it took Gasser an hour away from the slopes to come to terms with what she had just done and for the rush to subside. ""My heart was still racing and I had so much adrenaline,"" she says. ""I went to sit down for an hour before I started riding again."" Her secret? It was all about waiting for the right moment and seizing it with both hands when it came. ""I've had the trick on my mind for a long time, over a yea now,"" she admits. ""I've been doing doubles for so long and I knew the next step would be to go for the triple. I just knew I had to feel it and that was the case when I was at Stubai."" Gasser's milestone was, in many ways, a giant leap for women's snowboarding, five years after her double. To put that in perspective, Torstein Horgmo became the first man to land a triple cork in 2010, seven years after JP Walker stomped the first recorded double. Gasser has arrived at her snowboarding career via an early life competing in gymnastics. Despite being selected for the Austrian national squad at the age of 14, she wasn't satisfied her athletic energies being spent on the bars. ""I was a competitive kid and I just thought that I wasn't good enough at gymnastics at that age,"" she explains. ""It was really time consuming. I had a lot of fun and it was a passion of mine but at one point I was like, it's not worth the work for what I get out of it. ""Then I stopped with the gymnastics side and after not doing anything for two years my cousin took me snowboarding for the first time and I just loved. ""It's more about freedom. You always decide yourself what you're going to do with snowboarding. In gymnastics someone tells you what to do; with snowboarding actually in the first couple of years it was everything I wanted to do. I loved it from the beginning."" It's a love that, in recent years, has brought great success. Slopestyle gold at the Winter X Games in 2017 was backed up with big air gold at the world championships in Sierra Nevada a few months later. At the start of 2018 she won gold at the Winter X Games, and she added victory in the inaugural Olympic big air competition in South Korea. With the confidence of the world's first cab triple 1260 in her locker, Gasser is flying high. But she's keen to keep pushing the sport -- and herself. ""In snowboarding there are always a lot of ways to improve,"" she says. ""It doesn't always have to be a triple. ""There so much more stuff I can learn and want to learn. ""Of course I want to be one of the top girls but I'm just going to see how it feels. In this sport you never know what's going to happen.""","She had pictured the trick plenty of times in her mind's eye and even tried it once onto an airbag but no woman had ever pulled it off on snow.

Developing now, Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018 A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's ban on asylum for immigrants who cross the border illegally, prompting a likely legal challenge from the White House Sixteen House Democrats have signed a letter vowing to oppose Nancy Pelosi as House speaker An actress has filed a restraining order against lawyer Michael Avenatti days after his arrest on domestic violence charges A war of words has erupted between President Trump and a retired Navy admiral who oversaw the mission to kill Usama bin Laden, with the Republican National Committee siding with the president and outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan appearing to side with the admiral The White House decided Monday to no longer seek to revoke CNN correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass and has introduced a new set of rules for reporters at press conferences THE LEAD STORY - ASYLUM BAN CHALLENGED: A federal judge in San Francisco on Monday barred the Trump administration from refusing asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally, likely prompting a legal challenge from the White House... Trump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border would be ineligible for asylum. U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar, who was nominated by President Obama in 2012 to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, issued a temporary restraining order after hearing arguments in San Francisco. The order came as the Wall Street Journal reported that the number of migrants being allowed to cross the U.S.-Mexico border to legally apply for asylum had slowed down over the past week. According to the Journal, immigration lawyers have complained in recent days that asylum seekers are being blocked from entering the U.S. from the Mexican border cities of Matamoros, Reynosa and Ciudad Juárez. Weeks ago, 30 families or more were being allowed to cross the border daily at Yuma, Ariz. to apply for asylum. In the past two weeks, migrants and advocates say, U.C. Customs and Border Protection officials have slashed that number to one family a day at most. Meanwhile, Homeland Security officials revealed Monday that more than 500 criminals are traveling with the migrant caravan that’s massed on the other side of a San Diego border crossing. Homeland Security officials say there are 6,000 people in Tijuana waiting to be processed at the San Ysidro border crossing, with more on the way. Those who have already entered the border city in the past few days have been met with an icy reception. Migrant groups are beginng to realize they may have to wait six months for their asylum claims to be heard. The caravan arrivals are expected to continue into the week ahead. - Reported by Edmund De Marche (@EDeMarche on Twitter) and Greg Norman DEM CIVIL WAR: Sixteen House Democratic lawmakers circulated a letter Monday vowing to vote against Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House, calling for ""new leadership"" -- even though no challenger has stepped up to run against the California Democrat... “We are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus. She is a historic figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party’s most important legislative achievements,” the letter from both incumbent and newly elected Democrats read. “However, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change.” The letter was signed by former Pelosi challenger Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, along with other members like Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif.; and several incoming lawmakers, like member-elect Joe Cunningham of South Carolina. - Reported by Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews on Twitter) A RESTRAINING ORDER FOR STORMY'S LAWYER: An aspiring film actress on Monday filed a restraining order against lawyer Michael Avenatti – just days after he was detained by police on domestic violence charges, according to court records obtained by the Blast... Mareli Miniutti, an actress who appeared in ""Ocean’s 8,"" filed the domestic violence restraining order Monday in Los Angeles, the report said. It wasn’t immediately clear if Miniutti was the woman who accused Avenatti of domestic violence last week. Avenatti responded to the restraining order with a tweet: ""I have NEVER abused a woman or committed domestic violence. Any claim to the contrary is completely bogus and fabricated. I am a target. And I will be exonerated.” - Reported by Bradford Betz (@bradford_betz on Twitter) THE PRESIDENT VS. THE WAR HERO: House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Monday appeared to side with retired Navy Admiral William McRaven — the official best known for overseeing the Navy SEAL mission to kill Usama bin Laden—after President Trump questioned why McRaven took so long to find the Al Qaeda leader... Trump told “FOX News Sunday” that McRaven is a “Hillary Clinton fan” and an “Obama backer.” The Republican National Committee echoed the president’s comments, tweeting that McRaven has been critical of Trump from as far back as the 2016 campaign. Ryan said in a statement on Monday that the U.S. is grateful for McRaven and all members of the military who have served in harm’s way and “have put country before self,” according to The Hill. McRaven has repeatedly criticized Trump over the president's description of journalists as ""the enemy of the American people,"" writing in February 2017 that those comments represented ""perhaps the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime."" - Samuel Chamberlain (@SChamberlainFOX on Twitter) and Edmund De Marche NEW RULES: The White House will not seek to again revoke CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's hard press pass, as first reported on Monday by FOX News' John Roberts... “Today the White House fully restored Jim Acosta's press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House,” CNN said in a statement. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also implemented a series of rules that will govern White House press conferences going forward. According to Sanders, the new rules include: (1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists. (2) At the discretion of the president or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor. - Reported by Brian Flood (@briansflood on Twitter) AS SEEN ON FOX NEWS WHEN A JOKE BOMBS - ""I think he just nuked his [presidential] chances."" – Jesse Watters, on "" The Five,"" discussing how U.S. Rep.

"Beth Simmons is a professor of law, political science and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, where Michael Kenwick is a postdoctoral fellow. They lead the ""Borders and Boundaries in World Politics"" project. The views expressed here are theirs. View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)The United States is not the first country to obsess over its border security, and it will not be the last. Border security has been a central concern ever since the emergence of modern territorial states. 
But in this age of globalization, robotics and biometrics, something feels strange about the fixation on physicality in the border policy debate we are having in the United States. Should we build a wall or a fence? Steel slats or chain link? From sea to shining sea, or at border crossings? Or is the border secured by better technology, communications and personnel? 
Research we are conducting at the University of Pennsylvania can help to put the politicized hysteria of the moment into global and historical perspective. Our research group has begun collecting data on what we call ""border orientation"": a country's visible commitment to filter people and goods entering the nation. In particular, we are working to document the drive to place security architecture at international borders.
Our research thus far has yielded significant insights relevant to the border security debate. Among them: 
Globally, a fortification orgy
We have systematically evaluated every place on earth where a major road crosses an international border. Using publicly available satellite images, our researchers have inspected these crossings for barriers, inspection lanes and official stations.
We are finding unmistakable evidence the world over, but especially in North America, the Middle East and the outer edge of the European passport-free zone, that border crossings are more physically guarded by state agents than ever before. Our research also confirms existing studies that have found an increasing number of border walls in the world. 
What is behind this fortification orgy? Clearly, physical border structures are the prerogative of the rich. Gross domestic product per capita predicts which borders will be fortified, especially when one's neighbor is relatively poor. For example, the United States has more border architecture on its southern border than it does to the north. Such is the political economy of border fortification, on average the world over. 
But more concerning, our evidence shows that, even after accounting for wealth, border fortification is associated with more autocratic regimes. Free societies tend to favor more open borders. Democracies have historically been slow to wall and fence their international borders, at least in comparison with more repressive states such as those in Central Eurasia and the Middle East. Heightened demands for border security within the United States and Europe threaten to buck this trend, potentially reshaping the contours of democratic life. 
Our own research uncovers another interesting finding: Investments in infrastructure at border crossings are particularly common in states where the military is politically influential. The challenge to civil-military norms through recent troop deployments at the US border therefore appears to be emblematic of a broader, potentially troubling trend. 
How effective are border walls? Cautions from new research 
New studies underway are beginning to enlighten debates about the effects of border barriers. Research on barriers on the southern US and Israeli border demonstrate unanticipated consequences for undocumented immigration flows and local crime rates. Whether miles of walls will solve problems such as the illicit drug trade has been questioned by the US Drug Enforcement Administration's most recent National Drug Threat Assessment, which shows that drugs are primarily trafficked into the United States through legal ports of entry.
American policy must be informed first and foremost with US data. But there is value in looking at the experience of the rest of the world with border barriers. Our research group's worldwide evidence shows that walls are not likely to produce the results President Donald Trump seeks.
Take human trafficking as an example. On December 27, Trump tweeted that ""we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking, Gang Members &amp; Criminals from coming into our Country."" In his first address from the Oval Office, the President again referred to a flood of human traffickers over the southern border of the United States as a justification for a border wall. 
However, using global data coded from the US State Department's own Trafficking in Persons Reports, we are finding no evidence that border walls or fences affect the probability of reports of transnational human trafficking around the world. 
Rather, we are finding evidence that globally, reported trafficking ties between two countries are likely reduced when border crossings in destination countries have been strengthened with inspection capacity. Our research is ongoing and reflects correlations, not yet causal relationships, but so far it suggests that if we want to stop human trafficking, then border crossings, rather than long expanses of border, should be the primary focus of border security. 
Takeaway: Walls symbolize repression, contribute little
What do these global findings mean for the border debate in America? The world is complex and we are only beginning to collect the kind of information that might inform a reasoned debate about border security, especially barrier construction. But we should be aware of what is (and is not) happening beyond as well as at our borders. 
People on both sides of the issue appear aware of the tremendous symbolic significance border walls have. But worldwide, border barriers are more associated with autocratic regimes than free democracies. We should be aware of what kinds of signals we may be sending about who we are. The United States is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, and we should use this comparative advantage wisely. Walls and fences are expenses that have not delivered elsewhere.",Beth Simmons and Michael Kenwick are analyzing the physical realities of borders worldwide as part of a groundbreaking study. They argue we need more concrete evidence in this contentious debate over border walls and security.,2019-02-01T16:38:38Z,Border barriers are on the rise,CNN,0
"Alice Hill is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. She was formerly a federal prosecutor, judge, special assistant to the president and senior director for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. At the White House, she led the development of policy regarding national security and climate change, including the national flood risk management standard. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. 
 (CNN)Imagine an ordinary courtroom scene. The judge sits above the crowd wearing a black robe while one of the lawyers questions a witness. The witness gives an answer, but it's not the one the lawyer was looking for. So, the lawyer asks the question again, but the witness gives the same answer. When the lawyer asks a third time, the attorney for the other side rises to her feet and exclaims, ""Objection! Asked and answered!"" The judge agrees and, in a voice dripping with irritation, tells the first lawyer to move on to another question.
Judges don't take kindly to repeated attempts to ask the same question in the hopes of getting a different answer. Nor should the court of American public opinion -- at least not when it comes to questioning whether climate change is occurring and why.
According to The Washington Post, the Trump administration has decided to do just that by assembling a group of federal scientists to re-examine the government's scientific conclusions regarding climate change and the role humans play in contributing to it. 
This latest White House proposal builds off an earlier plan championed by William Happer, a senior director on the National Security Council and physicist who claims that more carbon in the atmosphere is helpful, not harmful to the planet. The details regarding the proposed group have evolved in recent days, but the idea is the same: Establish a committee to question government climate reports concluding that fossil fuel emissions harm the planet.
Congress established the US Global Change Research Program in 1990 to coordinate climate research across 13 federal agencies with a mandate to produce a national climate assessment every few years. Last fall, the program released its latest assessment, which runs more than 1,500 pages. The report reflects the consensus statement of a team of 300 federal and non-federal experts who received input from stakeholders across the country during a two-year period of study. The assessment, which was subjected to review by experts, the general public and the federal government, underwent external peer review as well.
The report found that human-caused emissions of greenhouse gasses were negatively affecting everything from our infrastructure to our health. It didn't take long for President Donald Trump to announce, ""I don't believe it."" And now, because the President and his advisers don't like the answer the rest of the federal government and climate science keep giving them, the White House wants to ask the question again -- despite the assessment's clear and resounding conclusions.
The question the White House wants to raise -- whether fossil fuels are harming the planet -- has been asked and answered. Decisively. Asking the question again won't change the answer or the science. Many Americans already know that climate change is happening, and the percentage of those who are worried about its impact has risen sharply in five years, according to a national survey by Yale and George Mason universities.
More than two-thirds of Americans say that climate change is happening and they are ""worried about it,"" while 62% understand that global warming is caused mostly by human activities. Given that the United States is witnessing weather and climate-related extreme events that cause more and more damage, the public's conclusions should come as no surprise.
Re-examining the climate science is a waste of everyone's time and taxpayer money. More dangerously, the Trump administration's effort to push for a different answer reduces the government's focus on answering the urgent question of what to do about climate change and its impact. At this moment, those answers are lacking.
For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- responsible for helping the nation prepare for extreme weather -- didn't even bother to mention climate change in its strategic plan for 2018-2022. And within months of taking office, Trump killed the federal agency planning requirements for climate change as well as efforts to address the national security risks. Just 10 days before Hurricane Harvey deluged Houston, Trump revoked the federal building standard designed to address increased flooding from climate change.
All of this has left the government and the American people desperately ill-prepared for the accelerating impact of climate change. Instead of rehashing questions that have been asked and answered, our government should be giving Americans the answers they need to prepare.","The question the White House wants to raise -- whether fossil fuels are harming the planet -- has been asked and answered.

It's going to take a while to process Friday's devastating pair of attacks on New Zealand mosques that left at least 50 dead. But changes are already being made -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed on Monday evening local time that the government has agreed to reform the country's gun laws. In fact, she said she expects announcement of the specific reforms to come within days. Meanwhile, New Zealand authorities are rushing to confirm the identities of the victims so their families can bury them as soon as possible in accordance with Muslim tradition. As for the gunman, 28-year-old Australian national Brenton Tarrant has been arrested and charged with one count of murder, however, he will most likely face additional charges. New Zealand authorities have also opened an inquiry into the gunman's actions and travels leading up to the attack. 
Investigators have confirmed that there are ""similarities"" between this month's Ethiopian Airlines crash and October's fatal Lion Air crash, but they're not saying anything else for now. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed March 10, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second disaster involving a new Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in less than six months, and that connection was enough to prompt aviation authorities around the world to ground all Boeing 737 Max 8s until more answers come to light. Air accident experts will continue to examine the black boxes of the two doomed aircrafts to determine what exactly led to the crashes.
The President found a lot to be upset about over the weekend, and he took to Twitter to make sure everyone knew. In a long series of tweets, Trump criticized the late Sen. John McCain, mused about a government inquiry into Saturday Night Live, and demanded that Fox News bring back host Jeanine Pirro. Pirro, whose regular show did not air Saturday, was reportedly suspended by the network after her widely-criticized comments about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Though tweetstorms by the President are fairly commonplace now, this one stood out in stark contrast to what pretty much everyone else in the world was talking about: The New Zealand attacks. 
The Democrats are coming along in their efforts of fielding a whole baseball team of presidential contenders. Kirsten Gillibrand officially entered the race on Sunday, and Joe Biden basically threw his hat in the ring on Saturday when he all but announced his intent to run during a speech in Delaware. Meanwhile, Beto O'Rourke will spend his second week of official campaigning on a multi-state tour of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and South Carolina. However, the hot Texas prospect has already landed himself in some hot water: Over the weekend, he apologized for joking that his wife has been raising their three children ""sometimes with my help.""
Severe flooding in Nebraska over the weekend broke several state records, and dangerously wet conditions in the area have left millions on edge. About 9 million people in 14 states along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers were under a flood warning as of Sunday evening. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) says more rivers will break cresting records in the next two days. The floods and cresting are a result of the powerful ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the central United States last week, bringing hurricane-like winds and blizzard conditions. Water left behind by the storm ended up in rivers and streams, causing the flooding days after the rain was over.

The Mueller report is in, and Donald Trump starts a brand new phase in his presidency. Special Counsel Robert Mueller didn't find that Trump's 2016 campaign or his associates conspired with Russia, Attorney General William Barr announced in a four-page letter to Congress. Mueller's report essentially punted on the question of whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. Mueller's investigation did not conclude that the President obstructed justice, but it also didn't exonerate him. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the decision the evidence was ""not sufficient"" to support prosecuting Trump.
A jubilant Trump went beyond the conclusions of Barr's letter by quickly tweeting that the report was ""total EXONERATION."" He said the whole investigation was ""an illegal takedown that failed"" and that he hoped a probe would be started of people on ""the other side."" Those close to the President said Team Trump will ""slam and shame"" the media during its victory lap. Trump's Republican allies in Congress felt vindicated as well.
So what happens now? Democrats and others are demanding to see Mueller's full report, especially the evidence on possible obstruction of justice. And calls are already being made to have Barr testify before Congress. Read six takeaways from Mueller's report. And don't forget, this doesn't end the legal wrangling for the President, as a number of investigations against Trump continue.
A village in Mali was hit with a horrible attack over the weekend. At least 134 people, including women and children, were killed when armed men dressed as hunters stormed the village of Ogossagou, the UN said. Many members of the country's Fulani ethnic community live in the area. They are often targeted and accused of having ties to jihadist organizations. Members of the Dogon ethnic group have been accused of past attacks against the Fulani. Mali's government promised to hunt down the attackers and punish them.

1. College admissions scandal
It's being called the biggest college admissions scam ever. Fifty people -- including rich parents, famous actresses, college prep officials and coaches -- are accused in a federal indictment of participating in a scheme to get students into top-notch colleges. Here's how the scam allegedly worked: Parents paid a college prep organization to take tests on students' behalf or correct their answers. The organization also bribed college coaches to get the students into desired schools as recruited athletes, even if they didn't play sports, prosecutors said. 
The biggest names caught up in this include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. Prosecutors say they have Huffman, a one-time Oscar nominee, on tape talking about the scheme. The charges against them have spurred a lot of ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Full House"" jokes, but this is no laughing matter. A senior academic adviser at the University of Minnesota says this cheating scandal is just the tip of the iceberg. And this may be the craziest thing: Some of the accused allegedly paid enough in bribes to finance a full college education! Get the latest on the case here.
The pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed over the weekend was wrestling with ""flight control problems"" before the plane went down, the airline's CEO told CNN. A number of nations have temporarily banned Boeing 737 Max jets from flying in their countries as authorities continue investigating the air tragedy. And many still wonder if there's any link between this crash and October's Lion Air disaster, when another 737 Max 8 flight went down in the Java Sea, killing 189 people. Right now, 737 Max planes are only flying in the US and Canada. Boeing says the planes are safe. But some in Congress aren't so sure, and the Senate plans to hold an air safety hearing.
Among the 157 people killed in the Ethiopia crash was an entire family from Canada. Kosha Vaidya, of Ontario, was taking her teen daughters to Kenya to show them where she was born. Vaidya's husband and parents also died in the crash. Click here for the latest updates.

"(CNN)A broken pipe may help explain why a famous Civil War submarine sank off of Charleston, South Carolina, more than 150 years ago.
The H.L. Hunley became the first submarine to successfully attack an enemy ship in combat when it sank the wooden ship USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864. The Confederate vessel disappeared with all its eight crew members.
More than 130 years later the Hunley was discovered on the ocean floor. The sub was raised and taken to a laboratory in North Charleston in 2000.
Since then, conservators and archaeologists have been working to preserve the vessel and study its contents in hopes of finally figuring out what happened.
They found the broken intake pipe at the front of the Hunley while cleaning away the thick, rock-hard coating of sand, shells, sea life and other materials -- known as concretion -- that built up on it over time. The pipe carried water to a ballast tank that helped the sub submerge and surface. 
There was a 1-inch gap where the pipe was supposed to mount to the side wall.
 ""It left a crescent-shaped opening in the hull which would be a great place to flood and sink your submarine,"" said Clemson University archaeologist Michael Scafuri, who's been working with the Hunley team since 2000.
The evidence is interesting, but not conclusive.
Scafuri said researchers can tell that the pipe broke around the time the Hunley sunk because of the amount of concretion that covered the break, but they can't yet tell whether the pipe broke during the attack or came apart after it sank.
""Obviously, with something like this, it's important (to know) if it happened the night of the attack and thereby might have caused the sinking, or if it happened two weeks later from some other reason after the submarine has already sunk,"" he said.
Researchers at the University of Michigan found it would have only taken 50-75 gallons of water to drag the Hunley to the ocean floor, according to a news release from the Friends of the Hunley organization. It would have only taken minutes for that much water to flow in through the hole.
The hole was small enough that a crew member could have stuffed something in it to slow the flow of water, or pumped the water, but that doesn't seem to have happened.
""They weren't trying to escape or taking other actions to save the sub,"" Scafuri said. ""There's no sign of panic on board.""
On the night of the attack, Scarfuri said that the captain's single candle would have been the only light in the cramped, 25-foot long crew area. If the candle went out, or was lost, they would have been working in the dark. There also would have been a fair amount of noise from the ocean around them.
""I don't know if he could see it, I don't know if he could hear it,"" he said.
The crew members' skeletal remains were found at their stations and their bodies had no obvious physical injuries.
A number of theories have tried to explain the mystery of the Hunley. Maybe the crew went too deep, misjudged their oxygen supply and got trapped by the current. Maybe a nearby ship collided with the sub, throwing it off balance into chaotic waters. Maybe a bullet made it through a porthole, killing the captain and leaving the crew adrift at sea.
The Hunley used a 135-pound bomb that was attached to a 16-foot long pole to sink the Housatonic Some scientists think the shock waves from the explosion could have killed or incapacitated the crew, but a US Navy study determined that they would have survived the blast.
""It's kind of a mystery,"" Scarfuri said.
He compared the archaeology to a crime scene investigation, but said it's now a very cold case.
""All of the evidence that was fresh at the time of the sinking is now blurred,"" Scarfuri said.
Scarfuri said each new piece of evidence gives researchers a better understanding of this important naval battle. He hopes they will one day get to the truth, but said he can't make any promises.
""It's not up to us,"" he added. ""It's up to the evidence.""",The discovery may tell researchers why the H.L. Hunley sank off the coast of South Carolina more than 150 years ago.,2019-01-16T20:59:56Z,A new clue could explain the mysterious disappearance of a Civil War submarine,CNN,0

 (CNN)President Donald Trump's prime-time address about the border wall Tuesday revealed his ongoing fixation with specific images and symbols at the expense of complex facts and Latin Americans.
He conjured images of ""a steel barrier,"" ""ruthless gangs,"" and ""weeping mothers."" Left out was mention of the diverse personalities, the varied backgrounds -- the humanity -- of the thousands of Central Americans who dream and plan and agonize about entering the US in quest of an image of their own: the American dream, el sueño americano. 
Trump again stated that a wall is ""absolutely critical"" for border security. As a reporter covering the border since 2015 for KPBS and our public media partners, I've been investigating the effect of physical border barriers on flows of illegal immigration and drugs. 
There is little evidence that existing barriers, construction of which took off in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, have played a significant role in decreasing either of those things. But there is abundant evidence that they have rerouted those flows into other areas: into the desert, the ocean, the sky and underground. 
Most of the activity that enriches transnational criminal organizations -- the smuggling of cocaine and other drugs -- occurs through legal ports of entry in cars. It's worth noting that a wall won't stop the southbound flow of the US guns those criminals use to protect their contraband -- the US guns that send Central American families north as they flee violence. 
What the wall does do, and has been doing, is push illegal immigration into increasingly dangerous areas.
When Trump highlights American lives lost to people who entered the US illegally on prime-time television, he obfuscates other lives and other faces. 
Just last month, the body of a drowned Mexican man who tried to swim across the border washed ashore in south San Diego County. Every year since border barriers began to be erected, hundreds of people have died of dehydration or heat exhaustion trying to enter the US through the desert. I've seen the skeletons myself. 
On three separate occasions, I've walked with Aguilas del Desierto, a group of farmworkers, plumbers and construction workers who spend their weekends finding the remains of lost migrants to give closure to the families of the lost. They follow vultures and the smell of baking flesh, or get rough directions from the coyotes who abandoned tired people.
Each time, we came across human remains, as well as countless abandoned items along the route: bibles being devoured by insects, crusty backpacks, empty gallon jugs. 
In high school, I read a book called ""The Devil's Highway"" by Luis Alberto Urrea. It brought to vivid life a large group of migrants who tragically died entering the US through the desert in 2001. The book made me realize journalism could give voice to those without a voice, even the dead. The prospect of that power inspired me to pursue a career as a journalist. 
Now, nearly 15 years later, the reality at the border remains largely the same as the one Urrea wrote about. The voices of the historically voiceless remain unintelligible, even as every major news organization sends journalists and photographers to the border. 
Central Americans, and even Mexicans, aren't as relatable to a majority of US citizens as ""the American blood"" cited by President Trump in his address Tuesday night. Our literature, film and entertainment is still dominated by white male protagonists. Our empathy is shaped by the stories we hear and read as we grow up: Hemingway, Steinbeck, Melville. 
When images of immigrants are used by the Trump administration, they are often used to stoke fear and resentment about ""criminals"" and ""invaders"" coming across the border. He mentions the women who are victimized -- sexually assaulted en route by those same criminals. President Trump has repeatedly used videos of the latest migrant caravan to dehumanize the group and to paint it as homogenous. 
Meanwhile, his opponents have used images of mothers running from tear gas to stoke anger at Trump and sympathy for the migrants. What's lost in this tug-of-war over the meaning of photos and videos of real people is the complexity of their reality on the ground.
The caravan is not a homogenous group of people. Some plan to cross the border illegally -- and I've seen them jump the fence. Dozens have stormed the border, following the instructions of US-based left-wing groups, like BAMN, By Any Means Necessary, which distributes flyers at the camps. Others are willing to wait as long as it takes to ask for asylum in the US.
In Tijuana, at an impromptu Catholic mass in the street, I spoke to one desperate mother who fled Honduras with her 3-year-old son. Maria Edwina Perez told me she feared that a minority of unruly men in the caravan would ruin everyone's chances of entering the US by giving everyone a bad reputation. She faces weeks of waiting for a chance to speak to US immigration authorities because of backlogs at the ports of entry. 
""If (Trump) doesn't want the men to enter, he should let the women enter. We come to work, not to create disorder. I am a daughter of God,"" she told me in a story for KPBS. ""I am a peaceful woman with patience.""
She recounted a dream in which President Trump let all of the children of the caravan flood into the US. 
Instead they, like the other asylum seekers, face weeks of waiting in Tijuana amid record homicides. Two teenagers from the caravan were killed last month. As the President continues to characterize people coming into the US as either criminals or victims, sinners or saints, they continue to live in limbo as three-dimensional human beings, real and vulnerable and in a way, indestructible.","As the President continues to characterize people coming into the US as criminals, victims, sinners, they continue to live in limbo as three-dimensional human beings, writes Jean Guerrera -- real and vulnerable and in a way, indestructible.",2019-01-09T07:13:25Z,The human beings Trump doesn't understand,CNN,0
"(CNN)Nearly 66 million years ago, a mass extinction event wiped out the dinosaurs and most life on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period. When an impact crater and other evidence of an ancient asteroid strike were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s, researchers believed that an asteroid caused the mass extinction. 
But skepticism has emerged in the scientific community, as many extinction events also occur in tandem with volcanic eruption.
Was the mass extinction triggered by the asteroid, was it a series of volcanic eruptions over thousands of years, or did the combined power cause this event? 
Two teams of researchers looked to India's Deccan Traps, one of the largest volcanic features on Earth. Their differing findings were published in separate papers in the journal Science on Thursday. 
Studying the Deccan Traps would allow the researchers to determine an eruption timeline and compare it to the Chicxulub asteroid impact on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, half a world away from the Deccan Traps flood basalts. 
Some of the Deccan Traps are more than a mile thick in some areas. The eruptions that formed the Deccan Traps took place over the course of a million years, sending lava flows in directions more than 300 miles away. 
Blair Schoene, associate professor of geosciences at Princeton University's Environmental Institute, and his team studied the feature using uranium-lead dating on crystals of zircon, which is found in cooling magma. The uranium isotopes start decaying as zircon crystallizes, transforming into lead isotopes at a steady rate. So Schoene and his team took samples from nine Deccan formations, like ash beds and the soil between ancient lava flows. 
Their timeline suggests that the Deccan Traps erupted in four 100,000-year events, each releasing a significant amount of greenhouse gases and magma.
Volcanic eruption is also thought to be a driver of climate change because so many greenhouse gases are released by eruptions and even the cooling of lava as it settles over other rocks. 
The timeline also suggests that the eruptions began before the asteroid impact, which implies that the climate change caused by eruptions could have triggered mass extinction ahead of the collision. 
A limitation of this kind of dating is that the crystals may have formed before eruption, which could affect the timeline.
A second research team, University of Liverpool geoscientist Courtney Sprain and her colleagues, used argon-argon dating. This technique measures the argon gas released from a sample after nuclear radiation. It's less precise than uranium-lead dating but directly measures the age of the lava flow. 
Sprain's team found that over 75% of the Deccan lava erupted about 600,000 years after the extinction event. This led them to believe that the asteroid may have caused an increase in eruptions. They also suggest that the eruptions would have caused delayed recovery of the biosphere after the asteroid impact.
""Now that we have dated Deccan Traps lava flows in more and different locations, we see that the transition seems to be the same everywhere,"" said Paul Renne, senior author of the second study and University of California-Berkeley professor-in-residence of Earth and planetary science, said in a statement. ""I would say, with pretty high confidence, that the eruptions occurred within 50,000 years, and maybe 30,000 years, of the impact, which means they were synchronous within the margin of error.""
Both dating methods provide different ways of looking at the Deccan Traps eruptions, and they're more precise than previous dating methods. 
The studies agree that the Deccan Traps eruptions occurred over the course of a million years, beginning about 400,000 years before the mass extinction and continuing for about 500,000 years after. And both agree that the Deccan Traps probably played a part in the extinction event. 
Looking ahead, the researchers agreed that they should collaborate. These new datasets create more questions, especially as we look to our future.
There have been five mass extinction events on Earth, and scientists believe that we're living through the sixth -- and that we're at fault for this one.
""Understanding past extinctions events -- their causes, and eventual climatic and biotic recoveries -- is crucial therefore when trying to wrap our heads around the many possible outcomes of our current trajectory towards disastrous climate change, ecosystem destruction, and potential mass extinction,"" Schoene said. 
""This is particularly true for the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event as the Chicxulub impact is one of the few events in Earth's history that occurred on a timescale similar to or potentially faster than modern climate change,"" Sprain said.","Nearly 66 million years ago, a mass extinction event wiped out the dinosaurs and most life on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period.

Air Force One is in the air and on its way home this morning, after President Trump's second summit with Kim Jong Un ended early. The President said his talks with the North Korean leader broke down without a deal after Kim insisted the US lift all sanctions on his country. Trump didn't want to do that. So, a planned working lunch and signing ceremony with the two men was canceled. ""Sometimes you have to walk,"" the President said in a news conference in Hanoi right before he left town.

It's Day 3 on Capitol Hill for Michael Cohen. The ex-Trump fixer and lawyer will testify behind closed doors today to the House Intelligence Committee. Everyone is still absorbing his explosive testimony from yesterday, when he essentially called the President of the United States a racist conman and criminal. To review, Cohen said:
 President Trump knew longtime confidant Roger Stone talked to WikiLeaks about hacked Hillary Clinton emails before they were released.
 Trump inflated his net worth to get on Forbes' list of richest people, yet deflated it for tax purposes.
 Trump lied about the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign because he didn't expect to win the presidency.
 Trump directed him to pay off Stormy Daniels.
 Trump directed him to threaten schools so they'd never release his grades or SAT scores.
 He didn't know of any direct evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia.
So, what happens now, after Cohen presented this mob-like view of Donald Trump's world? It's clear that nothing Cohen said yesterday will make Trump's base or Republicans desert him. And Democrats aren't set, just yet, to prep articles of impeachment based on the words of this extremely flawed witness. But Cohen's testimony does provide a road map, of sorts, that Dems can use as they investigate the President.

Pakistan says it shot down two Indian fighter jets over the disputed border region of Kashmir, in a significant escalation of the crisis between the two nuclear-armed powers. India confirmed the loss of one plane and said it shot down a Pakistani jet. Pakistan claimed to have captured an Indian pilot and published a video of him; India demanded his safe return. The confrontation happened a day after India said it launched airstrikes in Pakistan territory in the first such incursion by Indian air force planes since the India-Pakistan war of 1971. India and Pakistan both control parts of Kashmir, but each claims the region in full. 
The latest skirmishes are the most serious crisis over the disputed border area in years. This represents the first big political test for Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has only been in office for six months. President Trump, during his news conference in Vietnam, hinted that ""reasonably attractive news from Pakistan and India"" is coming, alluding to possible US attempts to de-escalate the crisis.

After days of heavy rain, Northern California's Russian River has turned the town of Guerneville into an island. The river crested last night at over 45 feet (about 13 feet above its flood stage), with the rising floodwaters submerging almost all roads leading into town and essentially cutting off the community of 4,500 residents. About 2,000 homes and buildings in Guerneville have flooded, and 59 people have been rescued. Residents paddled through the streets in canoes and kayaks. The river is expected to start dropping today and tomorrow.
Add this tidbit to the debate over school funding and equity (or lack of it) in public schools: US school districts with mostly white students get $23 billion a year more in funding than districts in which most students are not white. This stunning -- but not entirely surprising -- information comes from a report by the nonprofit EdBuild, which promotes equity in public schools. EdBuild found the average ""white"" district got $13,908 for every student in 2016, while ""nonwhite"" districts got only $11,682 per student. EdBuild blamed this money gap on the way Americans pay for education, with tax dollars controlled locally. EdBuild's CEO said local governments should rethink how school districts are drawn and noted the funding gap is a vestige of America's segregated past.

"(CNN)Some Senate Republicans will join with Democrats on Thursday to rebuke President Donald Trump on the central pledge of his presidential campaign, the animating issue of his presidency and the defining action of the last few months. 
It's not a question of if enough Republicans will support a Democratic resolution to terminate the President's national emergency declaration to build a wall along the US border with Mexico. It's a question of how many. 
Bottom line: The last-ditch effort to find a way to assuage concerns of Senate Republicans fell apart Wednesday, and the resolution will pass. Trump will be forced to veto the resolution -- the first veto of his presidency. 
The bigger picture: For the second time in two days, Republican senators will join with Democrats to support a measure the White House opposes -- first on Wednesday to end military support for Saudi Arabia in the civil war in Yemen, followed by Thursday's vote to terminate the national emergency. 
There are common threads here, from views of executive branch overreach to an administration that repeatedly declined -- or couldn't -- provide the information GOP senators explicitly requested as they made up their minds on these votes. 
Senior Republicans are playing down the votes as some kind of major rift -- and they aren't wrong. After all, Senate Republicans, many of whom were initially wary, are now fully behind the President on the border wall specifically, and the administration's overall border security goals. 
""It's not like this signals some big break from the President going forward,"" a GOP senator told CNN. ""But it is an example, one maybe we've avoided the last few years, that we can push back and send a message when we need to."" 
In tweets, Trump has continued to cast the vote as a binary choice, between his border security proposals and supporting Democrats. 
Administration officials were still in discussions with senators and staff throughout the day Wednesday. But Trump himself put an end to any hope of killing the resolution when he called Republican Sen. Mike Lee during a closed-door Senate GOP lunch and made clear he wouldn't support his proposal to limit future national emergency declarations to 30 days. 
Later in the day, in a meeting with GOP senators about trade, Trump went back to the resolution vote and attempted to lobby skeptical senators, according to Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who was there. 
But Alexander made clear it was done in a way he ""appreciated."" 
""He would like for us to vote against the amendment,"" Alexander said when he returned from the White House. ""But he understands and respects that senators may have different opinions.""
When CNN mentioned Alexander's comments to an aide with knowledge of the meeting, he said the senator's assessment tracked with what he'd been told, but noted: ""We'll see how long that understanding and respect holds after senators vote against him this afternoon.""
Nothing is official until Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announces it on the floor (but aides in both parties say the target is in the early afternoon -- sometime after lunch).
A technical addendum on jet fumes: This will be the last vote before a week-long congressional recess. Senators won't want to prolong this process any longer than they procedurally have to. 
As is often the case with votes like this, there are a good number of senators who have kept their powder dry on how they will vote. As one senior GOP aide explained, ""there's no reason to put a target on your back while talks are still ongoing and there's still some shot of a way out."" 
Well, that shot is officially gone. 
So, as is also the case with votes like this, expect a flood of statements and/or tweets to come out shortly before the final vote. Nothing is official until a senator gives a thumbs up or down on the floor, but here's a rough outline of who to watch, based on conversations with GOP senators and aides: 
Sen. Thom Tillis* (note: Tillis has been somewhat circumspect about his vote in the last few days as he's worked on a compromise with the administration)","Some Senate Republicans will join with Democrats on Thursday to rebuke President Donald Trump on the central pledge of his presidential campaign, the animating issue of his presidency and the defining action of the last few months.",2019-03-14T13:08:49Z,National emergency vote: Senate Republicans on track to rebuke Trump on marquee campaign issue,CNN,0
"Kirsten Gillibrand is the junior US senator from New York and a Democratic presidential candidate. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)Several weeks ago, I launched my presidential campaign in front of Trump International Hotel with a message that I believe in so strongly: When Americans join together to reject hate and division, hope rises, fear loses and, most importantly, bravery wins.
Bravery is exemplified by the millions of Americans who have tirelessly spoken out against this administration's cruel policies toward women, Muslims, the LGBTQ community and immigrant families at our border.
They have spoken out because President Donald Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He continues to demonize the vulnerable and he punches down. 
He does all of this because he wants us to believe he is strong. He is not. The President is a coward.
That's not what we deserve. So many Americans are making a choice to resist the backward pull of this administration and push us toward a better future. And we need a president who is worthy of their bravery. That is why I'm running for president of the United States.
We need to fight for an America where power truly belongs to the people, where our politicians care about everyone in this country -- and lead not from weakness or ego but from strength of character.
I know we can be that America. But it means starting at the root of many of our problems -- greed.
Right now, special interests are displacing the voices of the people of this country. Find me a so-called unsolvable problem, and I will point you to the greed and corruption standing in the way of solutions to it. 
Polluter profits take precedence over drinking water. Predatory lenders get special access to the White House and are allowed to take even more advantage of the most vulnerable customers. And the National Rifle Association, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America, stops popular common-sense gun reform, while stray bullets kill children in our communities.
Dark, unaccountable money is at the heart of this outrageous inaction. We need to crack open our government, flip the switch and let the light flood in.
That's exactly what I did when I came to Washington and challenged Congress by making my meetings, finances and earmark requests public with my Sunlight Report. In fact, I was the first member of Congress to put this information on my website, and it was not popular with a lot of my colleagues, who said I was setting the bar for transparency way too high.
I rejected that notion then, and I reject it now. The American people deserve to know their elected officials are working for them -- not special interests.
It's why I wrote and tirelessly pushed Congress to pass the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2012. I fought to make it illegal for members of Congress to line their pockets and profit from insider information. Public servants shouldn't enrich themselves from the offices they hold. 
And I will keep leading on transparency within my own office and campaign. That's why I am not taking any money from corporate political action committees, federal lobbyists or individual super PACs.
That's why I was the first presidential candidate to release my 2018 taxes, and have put 12 years of tax returns online -- going back to my first year in public office.
And as president, I will fight for publicly funded elections to reduce the influence of wealthy donors and special interests. I believe it's the closest thing we have to a silver-bullet solution to so many of our challenges. It would change the way Washington works overnight. 
Our president should govern based on the principle that our democracy only works when elected leaders hear directly from all Americans, regardless of their financial status.
Only then -- once we address the greed in Washington -- can we finally start making progress on the problems we face. 
But here is what I have also learned over the years. To take on the issues that matter the most, America needs a leader who is willing to be brave. I have learned that bravery means standing up to the powerful and summoning the courage to confront them head-on.
That's what I did when I first ran for Congress in a 2-to-1 Republican district that nobody thought I could win. Except for my mother, which tells you a lot about her. People told me: ""It has more cows than Democrats -- you just can't win!"" 
But I took those long odds, and I won. And the next election, I won again -- that time by a 24-point margin.
Why? Because I never forget who I serve. I stood up to greed and voted against the bank bailout. I stood up to corruption by making insider trading illegal for members of Congress. 
I stood up to bigotry and fought to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell.""
And it's why I'm proud to have stood up to Trump and voted against his Cabinet nominees -- more than anyone else in the US Senate.
I will go toe-to-toe with anyone to do the right thing. Whether it's powerful institutions, the President -- or even my own party.
We have big fights in front of us that we can't afford to lose. And we can't possibly win them if we aren't willing to speak out and speak up for what's right.
I am running for president to fix what's been broken, to repair our moral fabric and to rebuild the common bonds between us as Americans. This fight is so much bigger than any one election -- it's about making a choice and deciding who we are, and who we are going to be.
I believe that we can do this. And I know that, years from now, we will look back on this moment in our history, and we'll be able to say that we were brave enough to do something about it.",The senator says that Americans need a courageous president who is going to stand up to special interests and remove the greed from politics.,2019-04-09T18:45:33Z,Sen.

1. New York transformer explosion
If you were in New York around 9 Thursday night, as the sky lit up a brilliant shade of blue, you were probably asking yourself, ""What the heck was that?"" No, it wasn't an alien invasion or some out-of-control marketing stunt for the next ""Avengers"" movie. It was a transformer that blew up at a power plant in Queens, producing an eerie, glowing turquoise color that was visible for miles. The blast shook buildings, rattled windows and sent folks running into the streets. But thankfully no one was hurt in the explosion. There were some temporary power outages, and LaGuardia Airport closed for about an hour. New York police later tweeted that an equipment malfunction was the cause of the blast.
Wall Street's wild roller-coaster ride continues. The Dow started off Thursday by plummeting a whopping 611 points, then it rallied in the final hour of trading for a swing of almost 900 points. The late comeback saw the Dow close 260 points higher. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the day slightly higher as well. All this comes after the Dow suffered its worst ever Christmas Eve session, followed by its biggest ever daily point gain the day after Christmas. So what's fueling all of this volatility? Investors are worried that the economy, while still strong, will slow down in 2019. They're also watching to see how President Donald Trump's trade policies will turn out and what planned interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve will do
King Salman is shaking up Saudi Arabia's government as the kingdom continues to deal with the fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The foreign affairs minister was replaced, a new head of the National Guard was announced and new security intelligence officials were hired. But nothing seems to have changed for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir apparent to the Saudi throne who the CIA concluded ordered Khashoggi's killing. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and harsh critic of the Saudi regime, was killed and reportedly dismembered by a 15-person team at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul in October.
Protests broke out in parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after the latest delay in the presidential election there. The election, repeatedly postponed since 2016, is set for Sunday. But voters in the cities of Beni, Butembo and Yumbi won't be able to cast ballots until March, because of concerns about terrorism and an ongoing Ebola outbreak. The announcement of the delay sent people into the streets, where they blocked roads and burned tires. Police responded with tear gas to break up the crowds.
Blizzard warnings in the northern Plains and upper Midwest will wind down this morning as a severe weather system that also brought torrential rain to the South moves eastward. The storm, which killed two people, produced whiteout conditions and dumped up to a foot of snow in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas. A 75-mile stretch of Interstate 70 in Kansas was shut down because of the blizzard conditions. The storm system also soaked parts of Louisiana and Mississippi with more than 11 inches of rain. More than 50 million people remain under flood watches from New Jersey to Louisiana.

"SAN FRANCISCO As a grisly video recorded by the alleged perpetrator of Fridays bloody massacres at two New Zealand mosques played out on YouTube and other social media, Neal Mohan, 3,700 miles away in San Bruno, Calif., had the sinking realization that his company was going to be overmatched again.
Mohan, YouTubes chief product officer, had assembled his war room a group of senior executives known internally as incident commanders who jump into crises, such as when footage of a suicide or shooting spreads online.
The team worked through the night, trying to identify and remove tens of thousands of videos many repackaged or recut versions of the original footage that showed the horrific murders. As soon as the group took down one, another would appear, as quickly as one per second in the hours after the shooting, Mohan said in an interview.
As its efforts faltered, the team finally took unprecedented steps including temporarily disabling several search functions and cutting off human review features to speed the removal of videos flagged by automated systems. Many of the new clips were altered in ways that outsmarted the companys detection systems.
This was a tragedy that was almost designed for the purpose of going viral, Mohan said in an interview with The Washington Post that offered YouTubes first detailed account of how the crisis unfolded inside the worlds largest video site. Weve made progress, but that doesnt mean we dont have a lot of work ahead of us, and this incident has shown that, especially in the case of more viral videos like this one, theres more work to be done.
The uploads came more rapidly and in far greater volume than during previous mass shootings, Mohan said. Video, mainly from the point of view of victims, spread online from the shootings at a concert in Las Vegas in October 2017 and at a Pittsburgh synagogue this past October. But neither incident included a live-stream recorded by the perpetrator. In New Zealand, the shooter apparently wore a body-mounted camera as he fired into crowds of worshipers.
Each public tragedy that has played out on YouTube has exposed a profound flaw in its design that allows hate or conspiracies to flourish online. Despite being one of the crown jewels of Googles stable of massively profitable and popular online services, for many hours, YouTube could not stop the flood of users who uploaded and re-uploaded the footage showing the mass murder of Muslims. About 24 hours later after round-the-clock toil company officials felt the problem was increasingly controlled, but acknowledged that the broader challenges were far from resolved.
Every time a tragedy like this happens we learn something new, and in this case it was the unprecedented volume of videos, Mohan said. Frankly, I would have liked to get a handle on this earlier.
The company which has come under increasing fire for allowing Russians to interfere in the 2016 election through its site and for being slow to catch inappropriate content has worked behind the scenes for more than a year to improve its systems for detecting and removing problematic videos. It has hired thousands of human content moderators and has built new software that can direct viewers to more authoritative news sources more quickly during times of crises. But YouTubes struggles during and after the New Zealand shooting have brought into sharp relief the limits of the computerized systems and operations that Silicon Valley companies have developed to manage the massive volumes of user-generated content on their sprawling services.
In this case, humans determined to beat the companys detection tools won the day to the horror of people watching around the world.
YouTube was not alone in struggling to control the fallout Friday and over the weekend. The rapid online dissemination of videos of the terrorist attack as well as a 74-page manifesto, apparently written by the shooter, that railed against Muslims and immigrants seemed shrewdly planned to reach as many people online as possible.
The attack at one of the two mosques was live-streamed by the alleged shooter on Facebook, and it was almost instantaneously uploaded to other video sites, most prominently YouTube. The shooter appealed to online communities, particularly supporters of the YouTube star PewDiePie, to share the video. (PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, immediately disavowed the alleged shooter.)
Many of the uploaders made small modifications to the video, such as adding watermarks or logos to the footage or altering the size of the clips, to defeat YouTubes ability to detect and remove it. Some even turned the people in the footage into animations, as if a video game was playing out. For many hours, video of the attack could be easily found using such simple basic terms as New Zealand.
Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos depicting images from the shooting in the first 24 hours after it happened with 1.2 million of those blocked by software at the moment of upload. Reddit, Twitter, and other platforms also scrambled to limit the spread of content related to the attack. YouTube declined to say how many videos it removed.
YouTube has been under fire over the past two years for spreading Russian disinformation, violent extremism, hateful conspiracy theories and inappropriate childrens content. Just in the past month, there have been scandals over pedophiles using YouTubes comment system to highlight sexualized images children and, separately, a Florida pediatricians discovery that tips on how to commit suicide had been spliced into childrens videos on YouTube and its kid-focused app, YouTube Kids.
Pedro Domingos, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said that artificial intelligence is much less sophisticated than many people believe, and Silicon Valley companies often portray their systems as more powerful than they actually are as they compete for business. In fact, even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems still are fooled in ways that a human would easily detect.
In a way, theyre kind of caught in a bind when something like this happens because they need to explain that their AI is really fallible, Domingos said. The AI is really not entirely up to the job.
Other experts believe that the continuous spread of horrific content cannot be weeded out completely by social media companies when the core feature of their products enables people to post content without a prior review. Even if the companies hired tens of thousands more moderators, the decisions these humans make are prone to subjectivity error and AI will never be able to make the subtle judgment calls needed in many cases.
Former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot, who left the company in 2013 and now runs the watchdog group AlgoTransparency, says the company has not made the systemic fixes necessary to make its platform safe and he said it likely wont without more public pressure.
Unless users stop using YouTube, they have no real incentive to make big changes, he said. Its still whack-a-mole fixes, and the problems come back every time.
Political pressure is growing. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) singled out YouTube in a sharply worded statement Friday. And both Democrats and Republicans have called on social media companies to be more aggressive in policing their platforms to better control the spread of extremist, hateful ideologies and the violence they sometimes provoke.
YouTube executives say they began addressing content problems more aggressively in late 2017 and early 2018. Around that time, Mohan tapped one of his most trusted deputies, Jennifer OConnor, to help reorganize the companys approach to trust and safety and to build a playbook for emerging problems. The teams created an intel desk and identified incident commanders who could leap into action during crises. The intel desk examines emerging trends not only on YouTube but on other popular sites, such as Reddit.
The company announced it was hiring up to 10,000 content moderators across all of Google to review problematic videos and other content that have been flagged by users or by AI software.
Executives also shored up YouTubes software tools, particularly in response to breaking news incidents. They quietly built software, called a breaking news shelf and a top news shelf, that is triggered when a major news incident occurs and people are going to YouTube to find information, either by searching for it or by coming across it on the homepage. The breaking news shelf uses signals from Google News and other sources to show content from more authoritative sources, such as mainstream media organizations, sometimes bypassing the content that everyday users upload. Engineers also built a developing news card, which pops up on top of the main screen to give people information about a crisis even before they search. More recently, the company said it made changes to its recommendation algorithms, the popular content-suggestion software that is the way most users discover new videos.
The breaking news software worked as designed when the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., happened in February of last year, OConnor said in an interview. But over the following days, another unexpected development emerged: Survivors of the school shooting began to be harassed online. Some videos alleging that these students were crisis actors and not true victims became extremely popular on YouTube. Though the site had banned harassment since mid-2017, YouTube moderators were still learning how to apply its policies, OConnor said, acknowledging that mistakes were made.
Like Parkland, the New Zealand shooting presented another set of challenges that stressed the companys systems, Mohan said.
When the original video was uploaded Thursday evening, Mohan said the companys breaking news shelf kicked in, as did the developing news cards, which ran as banners for all YouTube users to see. Basic searches directed viewers to authoritative sources, and the autocomplete feature was not suggesting inappropriate words, as it had during other incidents.
Engineers also immediately hashed the video, meaning that artificial intelligence software would be able to recognize uploads of carbon copies, along with some permutations of it, and could delete them automatically. Hashing techniques are widely used to prevent abuses of movie copyrights and to stop the re-uploading of identical videos of child pornography or those featuring terrorist recruitment.
But in this case, the hashing system was no match for the tens of thousands of permutations of video being uploaded about the shooting in real time, Mohan said. While hashing technology can recognize simple variations such as if a video is sliced in half it cannot anticipate animations or two- to three-second snippets of content, particularly if the video is altered in some way.
Like any piece of machine learning software, our matching technology continues to get better, but frankly, its a work in progress, Mohan said.
Moreover, many news organizations chose not to use the name of the alleged shooter, so people who uploaded videos about the shooting used different keywords and captions to describe their posts, presenting a challenge to the companys detection systems and its ability to surface safe and trustworthy content. While Mohan said he agreed with the editorial decision not to name shooters, the name of a shooter is one of the most common search terms people use and a big clue for AI software.
On the night of the shooting, Mohan worried that the company wasnt moving quickly enough to address the problems. He made the unusual decision to suspend a core part of the companys operations process: the use of human moderators.
Under normal circumstances, software flags problematic content and routes it to human moderators. The reviewers then watch the video and make a decision.
But that system wasnt working well enough during the crisis, so Mohan and other senior executives decided to bypass human moderators in favor of software that could detect the most violent portions of the video. Bypassing the moderators meant that the AI was now in the drivers seat to make a final and immediate call, enabling the company to block content far more quickly.
But the decision came with a huge trade-off, Mohan said, because many videos that were not problematic got swept up in the automatic deletions.
We made the call to basically err on the side of machine intelligence, as opposed to waiting for human review, he said. He added the publishers whose videos were erroneously deleted could file an appeal with the company.
By mid-Friday, Mohan still wasnt satisfied with the results. He made another decision: to disable the companys tool that allows people to search for recent uploads.
Both the recent upload search and the use of moderators are still blocked. YouTube says they will stay disabled until the crisis subsides.
The company acknowledges that is not a final fix.

"LONDON (Reuters) - The flow of fresh funds to emerging markets should recover this year and next after a flood of money over the past decade, fuelled by loose monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Institute of International Finance said on Friday. 
The IIF predicted non-resident capital flows of $1.26 billion in 2019, up from $1.14 billion in 2018, and another modest recovery next year. 
“Global growth is looking more positive, but the world is a more difficult place for emerging markets that depend on foreign capital inflows,” the report said. 
Quantitative easing by G3 nations in recent years helped funnel funds to emerging markets, in search of yield. That led to a “positioning overhang”, with investors overloaded on emerging-market assets, the IIF said. 
Flows to China accounted for much of the recovery in the first quarter, it said. Excluding China from previous quarters showed successive recoveries were weaker. 
“Despite a positive growth backdrop, capital flows to non-China emerging markets will recover modestly in 2019 and 2020, while remaining short of the levels observed in 2017,” the report said. 
Total net capital flows to China are projected to reach $50 billion in 2019 and $110 billion in 2020, the IIF said. 
Non-resident capital inflows to Turkey should start to increase in the second half of 2019, assuming credible structural reforms helped to improve sentiment. But net inflows of non-resident capital are likely to moderate further in 2019, in step with the projected fall in output, the IIF said. 
Turkey’s lira has come under renewed pressure in recent weeks, after shedding nearly 30 percent against the dollar last year. That led to local banks halting lending to their overseas counterparts last week, a move that spooked foreign investors.","The flow of fresh funds to emerging markets should recover this year and next after a flood of money over the past decade, fuelled by loose monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Institute of International Finance said on Friday.",2019-04-05T12:47:17Z,"Flows to emerging markets should recover in 2019, 2020, IIF says",Reuters,0

"Amazon may be pulling the plug on its Queens campus, but New York Citys tech boom is likely to endure.
Long before Amazon announced that New York had won a share of its second-headquarters sweepstakes, tech was a rising force in the local economy. Google, which already has thousands of workers in New York, plans to double its work force in the city and build a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. Facebook, Apple, Uber and other companies are also expanding their presences, as is a rising generation of homegrown companies.
Even Amazon itself said Thursday that it planned to keep adding to its New York work force.

Every part of the city is feeling the impact of the technology boom, said William C. Rudin, a developer and the chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York. The geography of where these companies are, its not just Midtown South or Meatpacking. Its downtown, its Midtown East, its going to Brooklyn, its going to Queens.
In terms of raw economic power, Wall Street still dominates. Its workers earn more than $400,000 a year on average, close to three times as much as tech workers. As a result, the finance sector accounts for a huge share of city and state tax revenue, and wields disproportionate political power.

Mayors dating back to David Dinkins in the early 1990s have sought to make the city less vulnerable to the booms and busts of finance. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis, which wiped out thousands of jobs on Wall Street. Techs rapid expansion came at an auspicious time, helping the city rebound much faster than many experts had predicted.
There was a wide consensus that New York City needed to diversify its economy to add balance beyond Wall Street, said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York-focused think tank. I really think that tech has finally allowed New York to do that.
New York has never been a one-industry town. Even at its height in the early 2000s, Wall Street accounted for little more than 5 percent of the citys jobs and 20 percent of its total pay. New York is a center of media, advertising and fashion. And for the accounting, consulting and law firms that serve those industries as well as for the real estate moguls who build their office towers and condominiums.

Figures as of 2017 | Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics
New Yorks economic diversity is part of what drew tech companies to New York in the first place. When Google and other West Coast giants set up outposts here in the mid-2000s, they were mostly hiring advertising sales representatives and marketing managers, not hard-core coders.
Gradually, however, New York began to become a force for tech talent. Media and finance firms were trying to become more digitally savvy and needed programmers. Universities encouraged by successive administrations in City Hall created and expanded programs to give students digital skills.
As a share of the population, New York still has far fewer programmers, software developers and similar workers than Silicon Valley and Seattle. In raw numbers, however, the New York area has more such professionals than any other urban area.
But as Amazons pullback in New York shows, the technology industry also has yet to fully integrate itself into New Yorks power structure.

Only a handful of tech executives serve on the board of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group. Financial firms, labor unions and other traditional pillars of New Yorks economy still dominate the ranks of the citys top political donors.
And while New York has a growing start-up scene, few major tech companies are based here.
New Yorks cachet, New Yorks strength, is as a global headquarters city, said Kathryn Wylde, the partnerships president and chief executive. And if the C.E.O.s of the industry leaders are not here, we cant continue to lead the world as a commercial center. We wont have the magnetism.
Not everyone, of course, is pushing for tech to play a larger role in New York. Amazons plans were scuttled by a powerful backlash from unions, neighborhood groups and elected officials in Queens. Some of that opposition was fueled by the multibillion-dollar incentive package the city and state offered to lure Amazon. But critics also worried that the flood of well-heeled tech workers would drive up already sky-high rents.
Dan J. Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, said those concerns were particularly acute because of the size and concentration of Amazons planned campus, which he likened to the company towns of the early 20th century.
There is the possibility of displacement of existing businesses and of the exacerbation of inequality that already exists in New York, Mr. Wang said.
Other companies, such as Google, have been more subtle, building up presences in neighborhoods without taking over.
That might explain why, before the furor over Amazon, techs rise had managed to stay largely beneath the radar.
Tech has become a huge and crucial part of the New York City economy, Mr. Bowles said. Im not sure that most New Yorkers know that right now.","Why Tech Could Keep Gaining Ground in New York Even Without Amazon New York Times Amazon HQ2 defeat is loss for the city, local tech leaders say The Verge Amazon’s exit could scare off tech companies from New York Boston Herald New York's Rejection of Amazon …",2019-02-15T10:01:53Z,Why Tech Could Keep Gaining Ground in New York Even Without Amazon - New York Times,The New York Times,0

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bankers in Asia are betting on newly-listed companies returning to the markets for fresh capital as last year’s flood of initial public offerings (IPOs) slows to a trickle, with 2019 seeing the weakest start in equity sales in three years. 
Equity sales in the region, including IPOs, convertible bonds and follow-on sales, fell 41 percent to $49.1 billion in the first quarter, Refinitiv data show, the slowest since 2016. 
Fees from equity capital market (ECM) deals have reached $966 million so far, bankers’ worst quarterly haul in six years. 
The data make for a sobering read after 2018 when Asia’s red-hot markets hosted many multi-billion dollar IPOs, including SoftBank Corp’s $23.6 billion Tokyo float and Xiaomi’s $5.4 billion one in Hong Kong. 
But bankers hope some of the gloom will be lifted as many of the companies that went public last year return for additional capital, making 2019 less a year of jumbo IPOs and more of follow-on capital raisings and convertible bonds. 
“We are already seeing companies that went public last year coming back ... with follow-on offerings,” said Goldman Sachs’ David Binnion, co-head of equity capital markets, Asia ex-Japan. 
GRAPHIC: here
“In many situations these follow-on financings are coming sooner after listing than we have historically seen, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of these growth companies.” 
Many firms that went public last year raised less than they had aimed for as investors pushed back against lofty valuations. 
That will further drive follow-on activity, bankers said. 
Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, video streaming company iQIYI and e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, all 2018 IPOs, have come back to the market to raise funds. 
NIO raised $750 million in a five-year convertible bond this year, four months after it went public in New York, while iQIYI raised $1.1 billion in six-year convertible bonds this week in its second such issue within a year of its IPO. 
Pinduoduo raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on offering in February, the fourth-largest ECM transaction this quarter. 
Asian companies have sold $21.3 billion in convertible bonds so far, a record for this point in any year. 
GRAPHIC: here
IPO SLOWDOWN 
After a blockbuster IPO year for Asia in 2018, led by Hong Kong that hosted deals worth $36.3 billion - its best year in eight - 2019 is expected to be much slower. 
“Some drivers of last year, such as mega IPOs out of China will probably be fewer,” said Murli Maiya, co-head of investment banking coverage for Asia Pacific for JPMorgan. 
“There should be continued investor interest in IPOs, but likely at different price points and in different sectors.” 
Hong Kong’s largest IPOs this year are likely to be from non-Chinese firms such as UK data centre operator Global Switch, which plans to raise $1 billion, and a spin-off of the Asian interests of the world’s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, which could raise over $5 billion, sources say. 
The largest IPO in Asia this year so far was the $687 million float of Embassy Office Parks REIT in India, the country’s first real estate investment trust IPO. 
But bankers are optimistic the good performance of smaller IPOs, such as CStone Pharmaceuticals and Chinese broker Futu Holdings, will give investors confidence after the bleak performance of many newly-listed shares in 2018. 
GRAPHIC: here
Despite the headline-grabbing amounts raised in IPOs last year, many companies languished below their offer prices with Sino-U.S. trade tensions keeping investors on tenterhooks. 
Successful floats will give “investors the confidence that the IPO market is still an important contributor to performance and that’s important for the rest of 2019”, said Jason Cox, head of ECM, Asia Pacific for Deutsche Bank.

"VILNIUS (Reuters) - About 100 British financial companies and start-ups are applying for a licence in burgeoning fintech hub Lithuania to ensure they have access to the European Union after Brexit, the country’s central bank told Reuters. 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but has not yet reached a deal on a post-Brexit relationship, meaning companies with UK-issued licences may no longer have the right to provide some financial services in the EU. 
British companies are looking to get electronic money institution licences, Marius Jurgilas, member of the board at the central bank, told Reuters in an interview. 
“It seems that the companies, many of which are quite large, are behaving like a student who only starts worrying on the eve of an exam,” he said. 
He said Lithuania can process an electronic money institution licence application in as little as three months, compared to about a year in some EU countries, giving it an advantage over other fintech centres such as Luxembourg, Ireland or Belgium. 
“It is an onslaught ... We do not have the resources to process all the applicants. We have to pick-and-choose, prioritising the least risky applicants,” said Jurgilas, who did not provide names of the companies due to confidentiality rules. 
Ireland’s central bank said in October that it had seen a surge in financial services firms seeking to set up or extend their operations in Ireland as a result of Brexit and is processing over 100 applications. 
Lithuania began attracting fintech companies a few years ago, and as of January has issued a total of 83 licences to such firms, second only to Britain among European Union countries, according to government figures. 
The newcomers include a payment arm of Alphabet Inc’s Google and Revolut, a British digital-only bank, and Jurgilas said the central bank is ready to step up its oversight capabilities as the sector grows. 
Jurgilas dismissed suggestions that firms were drawn to Lithuania by a benign regulatory regime. 
The “European Union has institutions which make sure that market supervisors in all its countries, including Lithuania, work to the same standard, and if any Lithuanian-registered bank grows into significant size, its supervision will be taken over by the European Central Bank”, he said.

"A major storm in the central U.S. is bringing severe weather, flash flooding and heavy snow to the eastern half of the nation. This same major storm was responsible for setting off a tornado outbreak in Illinois on Saturday evening. There were 22 reported tornadoes on Saturday, all in central Illinois, near Springfield. On the colder side of the storm, heavy snow continues to fall in parts of the upper Plains and Midwest. Mullen, Nebraska, has received 14 inches of snow; Norris, South Dakota has 8.5 inches; and Hudson, Wisconsin has seen 5.6 inches. On the warmer side of the storm, parts of the south have seen over half a foot of rain, including 9.71 inches in Pace, Florida, and 6.57 inches in Lillian, Alabama. Storms stretch along the entire eastern U.S. on Sunday morning. The storm is slowly moving through the central U.S. and will gradually slide east on Sunday. Severe weather and flash flooding remain likely in the Southeast, while heavy snow will be slow to move east across parts of the Midwest. Meanwhile, an icy mix is possible ahead of the storm in parts of the Northeast on Sunday morning. The threat of tornadoes and flash flooding exists for the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama and Georgia on Sunday. A new tornado watch was issued for parts of southern Georgia and Alabama until 11 a.m. Sunday morning. Additionally, a flash flood watch has been issued for parts of this region, as well as a large part of the Florida Panhandle, due to heavy rainfall rates up to 2 to 3 inches per hour. This could cause flash flooding this morning and some flash flood warnings have already been issued Sunday morning in parts of this region. The radar Sunday morning is showing numerous thunderstorms moving into the region, with some of the storms showing some weak rotation. This line of storms will slowly slide eastward and extend into the rest of the Southeast from Georgia to North Carolina. A slight risk for severe weather exists in the Southeast with damaging winds and brief tornadoes possible. Rain is falling from Philadelphia to Boston on Sunday morning, while inland New York and New England are seeing snow, sleet and freezing rain. Meanwhile, heavy rain has moved into the major I-95 cities in the Northeast. Away from the coast, temperatures are near freezing, especially in some of the higher elevations of New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire. As a result, a mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will fall at times through the early morning hours. This could create slick conditions in parts of the interior Northeast. The wintry weather threat will end during the day on Sunday as temperatures begin to warm up. On the back side of this storm, colder air is supporting snowfall through the remainder of Sunday from Nebraska to Michigan. However, the bulk of the snow has ended, with the heaviest accumulations to come expected in parts of Wisconsin and Michigan. A few more inches of snow are possible across the Plains and in the Great Lakes on Sunday. The bulk of this storm will wind down by Sunday night. However, a glimpse ahead does show another strong storm headed for the West Coast by midweek, which likely will become another major storm to track for parts of the central and eastern U.S. in the upcoming week.",The storms produced 22 reported tornadoes in Illinois.,2018-12-02T11:21:43Z,Severe weather threat moves into Southeast,ABC News,1

"VILNIUS (Reuters) - About 100 financial companies and start-ups from Britain and elsewhere are applying for a licence in burgeoning fintech hub Lithuania to ensure they have access to the European Union after Brexit, the country’s central bank told Reuters. 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but has not yet reached a deal on a post-Brexit relationship, meaning companies with UK-issued licences may no longer have the right to provide some financial services in the EU. 
The companies, a quarter of which hail from Britain, are looking to get electronic money institution licences, Marius Jurgilas, member of the board at the central bank, told Reuters in an interview. 
“It seems that the companies, many of which are quite large, are behaving like a student who only starts worrying on the eve of an exam,” he said. 
He said Lithuania can process an electronic money institution licence application in as little as three months, compared to about a year in some EU countries, giving it an advantage over other fintech centres such as Luxembourg, Ireland or Belgium. 
“It is an onslaught ... We do not have the resources to process all the applicants. We have to pick-and-choose, prioritising the least risky applicants,” said Jurgilas, who did not provide names of the companies due to confidentiality rules. 
Ireland’s central bank said in October that it had seen a surge in financial services firms seeking to set up or extend their operations in Ireland as a result of Brexit and is processing over 100 applications. 
Lithuania began attracting fintech companies a few years ago, and as of January has issued a total of 83 licences to such firms, second only to Britain among European Union countries, according to government figures. 
The newcomers include a payment arm of Alphabet Inc’s Google and Revolut, a British digital-only bank, and Jurgilas said the central bank is ready to step up its oversight capabilities as the sector grows. 
Jurgilas dismissed suggestions that firms were drawn to Lithuania by a benign regulatory regime. 
The “European Union has institutions which make sure that market supervisors in all its countries, including Lithuania, work to the same standard, and if any Lithuanian-registered bank grows into significant size, its supervision will be taken over by the European Central Bank”, he said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street will be watching next week’s economic data with a laser focus after a dismal February jobs report and recessionary warning signals from U.S. Treasury yields. 
After the longest U.S. government shutdown on record, bad weather and a late 2018 equities sell-off muddied market participants’ view on the U.S. economy in recent months, they are hoping for a clearer view from upcoming data. 
Investors have been anxious for reassurance since U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields last Friday fell below three-month Treasury bill yields for the first time since 2007. 
The S&amp;P fell almost 2 percent that day as yield curve inversions are widely viewed as recessionary indicators and this one occurred two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled back on expected rate hikes amid signs of slowing economic growth. 
“Investors are going to be hyper-sensitive to data,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. “The yield curve inversion is the manifestation of investors’ fears that the U.S. is getting caught up in a global slowdown.” 
Many investors say they do not expect a U.S. recession any time soon. But they are seeking confirmation for this optimism in next week’s data, which includes retail sales, manufacturing activity, durable goods orders and non-farm payrolls. 
Reports that meet or beat expectations “would suggest the soft patch we entered the year with is temporary” and would confirm economic projections for 2019, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. 
February’s U.S. retail sales data, due on Monday, and the March jobs report, scheduled for Friday, may be the most closely watched indicators as economists want reassurance on the spending power and confidence of U.S. consumers, which represent about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. 
U.S. non-farm payroll growth almost stalled in February, with only 20,000 jobs created. Economists polled by Reuters last expected an average of 170,000 new jobs for March. 
January retail sales rose a modest 0.2 percent after a December decline, but were not seen as strong enough to alter slowing U.S. economic momentum. Economists, on average, expect a February increase of 0.3 percent. 
“If we were to witness a faltering of the U.S consumer, that would be very difficult for markets, which are relying on the U.S. consumer to propel the cycle through at least another year,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife in Toronto. 
But Donald expects a rebound in both retail sales and jobs, since the last reports were weakened by the December-January government shutdown. She will also watch durable goods data, due on Tuesday, for a view on corporate capital spending. 
“I have less conviction capex will take off markedly, but if we do see an improvement, that would be a substantial surprise,” said Donald. 
Strong capex would also surprise TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan, who says companies have stalled spending as they await the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks. 
Kinahan says U.S.-China tensions could mute market reactions to data “unless it’s so far off to the upside or the downside.” The two countries are due to negotiate in Washington, D.C., next week after what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said were “constructive” talks in Beijing this week. 
Options contracts on the S&amp;P 500 Index and its tracking fund, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, show a modest uptick in the volatility priced into contracts expiring next Friday, compared with other near-term expirations. 
“We should expect more volatile days,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Probably the job numbers will be the biggest focus, partly because of February’s miss and partly due to the overall concerns about slower growth.” 
Manufacturing data will also be under close scrutiny on Monday after weak U.S. and German March data last Friday, according to Cresset’s Ablin. 
While Ameriprise’s Price is expecting solid data, he cautions: “The market has more downside risk than upside risk primarily because of the yield inversion, the concern over the tone of economic data over the past few months, not just in the United States, but around the world.”

"Michigan's attorney general in 2016 promised to investigate ""without fear or favor"" the scandal over Flint's lead-tainted drinking water and pledged that state regulators would be locked up for fudging data and misleading the public.
Yet three years later, no one is behind bars. Instead, seven of 15 defendants have pleaded no contest to misdemeanors, some as minor as disrupting a public meeting. Their records eventually will be scrubbed clean.
That has angered some people in Flint who believe key players who could have prevented the lead disaster are getting off easy. Four of five people at the state Department of Environmental Quality who were on the front line of the crisis have struck deals. The remaining cases mostly center on a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease and early disastrous decisions to use water from the Flint River.
""I'm furious absolutely furious,"" said LeeAnne Walters, a mother of four who is credited with exposing the lead contamination. ""It's a slap in the face to every victim in the city of Flint.""
Walters, 40, said she was repeatedly brushed off by the Department of Environmental Quality, known as DEQ, even as she confronted officials with bottles of brown water. She testified in Congress after then-Gov. Rick Snyder in 2015 finally acknowledged the lead mess, and she later was honored with an international prize for grassroots environmental activism.
""Instead of people being held accountable, they're getting a free pass,"" Walters said. ""The fact remains there wouldn't have been a problem with the lead and the legionella if the water had been treated properly, if MDEQ would have done their job.""
Flint was one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in U.S. history. While waiting for a new pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron, the majority-black city of 100,000 pulled water from a river in 2014-15 without treating it to reduce corrosive effects on old pipes. Lead infected the distribution system in Flint, where 41 percent of residents are classified by the government as living in poverty.
Due to poor finances, Flint was being run by financial managers appointed by the governor. The uproar over water quality reached a peak by fall 2015 when a doctor reported high levels of lead in children, which can cause brain damage. The water no longer comes from the river and has significantly improved, but some residents are so distrusful that they continue to use bottled water.
Liane Shekter Smith, who was fired as head of Michigan's drinking water office, was charged with misconduct in office and neglect of duty. Special prosecutor Todd Flood later put her on notice that he would pursue an involuntary manslaughter charge, arguing that she could have shut down the Flint water plant and reduced the threat of legionella bacteria, which causes Legionnaires'.
But charges were dropped on Jan. 7 in exchange for a no-contest plea to an obscure misdemeanor that will not result in any jail time: disturbance of a lawful meeting. She had declined to accept a report about water quality from Walters and others. Two other key agency employees, Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch, made deals on Dec. 26. All three will have their records erased if they cooperate with Flood.
Shekter Smith wanted ""to put some closure on this matter,"" attorney Brian Morley said of her plea agreement. ""Criminal charges weren't warranted.""
State Sen. Jim Ananich of Flint, who runs his water through a filter, said he's listened to frustrated residents.
""At the beginning there was a feeling of good, someone is going to be held accountable. Now people don't believe anyone is going to be held accountable,"" he said.
The outcome so far is different than the dramatic scene in 2016 when Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican who was poised to run for governor, traveled to Flint to announce felony charges against Prysby, a DEQ engineer, and Busch, a DEQ regional supervisor.
""Mr. Busch and Mr. Prysby misled federal and local authorities, regulatory officials, and failed to provide safe and clean water to families of Flint,"" Schuette declared at that time. ""When we prove these allegations and we will Mr. Busch and Mr. Prysby will be facing five years in prison for this count alone.""
Andy Arena, a Flint water investigator and former head of the FBI in Detroit, believes the plea deals are appropriate.
""There are culpable folks out there that we need to get to,"" he said. ""This is how it works: You cut deals with certain people to move the case up the line. I believe these people have some information that could significantly assist in our ongoing investigation.""
Schuette, who lost the governor's race and is out of public office, said: ""I stand with Andy,"" referring to Arena. Flood declined to comment on his strategy.
The new attorney general, Dana Nessel, has asked a Detroit-area prosecutor to review the remaining cases , including involuntary manslaughter charges against Nick Lyon, the former head of the Michigan health department who has been ordered to trial.
Lyon is accused of failing to alert the public in a timely manner about the Legionnaires' outbreak, which has been linked to foul water and at least 12 deaths. Dr. Eden Wells, who was Michigan's chief medical executive, also is facing an involuntary manslaughter trial, although both cases are tied up in appeals by aggressive defense teams.
Gerald Ambrose and Darnell Earley, who were state-appointed emergency managers when Flint was using river water, are also charged. They're accused of being obsessed with saving money instead of protecting residents. All have pleaded not guilty.

"El Niño winters like the one we are entering are known for their moisture-rich southern storms. Perhaps it is no huge surprise, then, that a major winter storm is shaping up across the Southern United States, which could dump historic amounts of snow in the Southern Appalachians. This developing winter storm, with Pacific origins, will affect a huge zone from the Southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. The storm kicks into gear Friday and lasts into early next week before departing. As of early Thursday afternoon, winter storm watches were already up from eastern New Mexico through northwest Texas and across much of Oklahoma, then into the Arkansas/Missouri border region. Additional watches and warnings will be extended east in the days to come. On Friday, a low-pressure system begins to form over Texas and northern Mexico. Heavy rain spreads across Texas as snow and ice breaks out in areas along the northern portion of the storm system. Wintry precipitation is primarily expected from New Mexico through the Texas Panhandle and eventually into parts of Oklahoma heading into Saturday. In the warm sector of this storm system, across Texas and eventually across the South, widespread rainfall totals of one to two inches are likely. A big chunk of East Texas may end up with as much as three to six inches of rain, including Houston, San Antonio and Austin. In this region, flood watches and river flood warnings are up due to the heavy rainfall anticipated over the coming days. Any severe storm threat seems limited by the fact that the low-pressure center may track right along the northern Gulf Coast, thus limiting northward expansion of warm and humid air. If it ends up farther north than that, however, storms containing damaging winds and hail could develop in parts of the South, especially Saturday. Although cold air with this system is somewhat limited, a swath of wintry precipitation stretching is expected along the storms north and northwest flank. Snow totals are likely to first peak in the Southern Plains and Ozarks into Saturday, easing some through the Tennessee Valley before increasing again over the Southern Appalachians on Sunday. Along with the snow threat, some significant icing is expected, especially in the Southern Plains. Widespread freezing rain accumulations of 0.10 inches to 0.25 inches are possible northwest Texas through southwest Oklahoma and into northwest Arkansas. Some locations may see up to half an inch of ice. In Oklahoma City, where 3 to 6 inches of snow and glaze of ice are predicted Friday morning through Saturday evening, shoppers are clearing grocery store shelves of staples: The storms most serious impact may target the Southern Appalachian. In western North Carolina and Southwest Virginia, a foot or more of snow may fall Saturday night through Sunday night. Heavy snow may also blanket portions of northwest South Carolina, eastern Tennessee and Kentucky and southwest West Virginia. Some of the high terrain in western North Carolina may see upward of two feet of snow. A number of populations centers in western North Carolina and Southwest Virginia are likely to see substantial accumulation. Here are some select forecasts, which are subject to change as the storm track comes into focus: Asheville: 12 to 24 inches Blacksburg: 8 to 14 inches Roanoke: 5 to 10 inches Lynchburg: 3 to 6 inches If a foot of snow falls in Asheville, it would mark the fifth biggest storm on record. The total would need to best 18.2 inches to top the biggest snowstorm on record, from March 1993, which is a possibility. Computer models are projecting as much as 22"" of snow for/near #Asheville, NC. That's more than the Superstorm of 1993. Here are the top 5 snowstorms in Asheville history. 1. 18.2"" March 1993 2. 16.3"" Dec 1971 3. 15.9"" Feb 1969 4. 14.0: Jan 1988 5. 11.5"" April 1987 pic.twitter.com/m7L6Ibtudn — Mike Bettes (@mikebettes) December 5, 2018 Some questions remain about the intensity of snowfall in lower elevations to the east of the mountains, mostly Sunday. The best guess continues to be that even places like Greensboro, Charlotte, Raleigh and Richmond are likely to see at least several inches from this event, with amounts decreasing to the northeast within this zone. How far north accumulating snowfall makes it in the Mid-Atlantic is up for much debate. The dividing line between accumulating snow and just flurries may set up in Central Virginia around Charlottesville which could see several inches or just a dusting depending on the storms northward extent. The Washington region seems unlikely to see a major snowfall, but its certainly possible that snowflakes will visit this region as well before the system wanders off into the Atlantic Ocean, especially if it shifts north.",Parts of western North Carolina and Southwest Virginia are likely to see more than a foot of snow.,2018-12-06T20:33:48Z,Moisture-packed storm to wallop Southern Plains and Southern Appalachians with snow and ice,The Washington Post,1

"Its been just four months since the last hurricane season ended, but already time to look ahead to the next. June 1 marks the traditional starting date, and Colorado State Universitys hurricane research team released their initial predictions for the upcoming season Thursday morning.
The groups outlook calls for a total of 13 named storms. Breaking it down further, they venture five of those will become hurricanes and two of those will become major hurricanes, meaning they will be Category 3 or stronger. This outlook does not attempt to determine where storms might develop, or how many might make landfall in the United States.
This years outlook is slightly below whats considered an average season: 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes.
In 2018, 15 named storms developed in the Atlantic Ocean, eight of which were hurricanes and two of those were major hurricanes. One of those was Hurricane Michael. Its been a mere six months since that storm roared ashore on the Florida Panhandle as one of the most intense hurricanes to ever hit the United States. With winds up to 155 mph, the Category 4 leveled buildings and structures in Mexico City.
Hurricane Michaels winds were just shy of making it a Category 5 storm, but for all intents and purposes, it was the worst-case scenario for Mexico Beach and its surroundings near Panama City. It was the third-strongest hurricane on record, in terms of pressure, to make landfall in the United States, and it had the strongest winds since Hurricane Andrew made landfall in 1992. Economists predict Michael will cost $25 billion.
Earlier in the season, Hurricane Florence made a slow-motion landfall in the Carolinas and unloaded more than 30 inches of rainfall that overwhelmed the region with flood water for days. More than a dozen rivers crested at major flood stage, characterized by catastrophic property inundation and evacuations. Florence broke flooding records set during hurricanes Floyd in 1999 and Matthew in 2016. Damage estimates sit around $25 billion.
Now in 2019, the state of El Niño and the setup of Atlantic ocean temperatures are two critical factors Colorado state is considering in their outlook. Both of which are pointing to a less-active season.
El Niño
During the past several months, El Niño conditions have developed Pacific Ocean, meaning that sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropics are warmer than normal. In general, El Niño conditions tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane formation, due to increases in upper-level winds that tear apart developing Atlantic hurricanes.
Unfortunately for seasonal hurricane forecast skill, predicting changes in El Niño is extremely difficult during the spring season, so while we know theres an El Niño now, we dont know for sure it will continue through the rest of the year. Very small changes in wind conditions can cause big changes in the ocean circulation at this time of year. Consequently, the models that forecast El Niño tend to have less skill. Nevertheless these models do still have modest ability to be able to predict conditions for the next several months.
The latest suite guidance indicates that there is a relatively high chance that El Niño continues through the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season (August-October). Colorado State agrees with the majority of these models and anticipates El Niño conditions to persist through this years hurricane season.
North Atlantic sea surface temperatures 
The tropical Atlantic is currently slightly cooler than normal, and the far North Atlantic is much warmer than normal. The subtropical Atlantic is much warmer than normal. This ocean temperature pattern is typically what is observed in less-active hurricane seasons, since strong hurricanes tend to form in the deep tropics. 
How good are the forecasts?
April is the first forecast issued by Colorado State each year. These forecasts are then updated in early June, July and August. The forecast skill increases closer to the peak of the season. The April forecast shows modest skill, while the June, July and August forecasts show improved skill levels. Typically, El Niño forecasts improve, and the SST pattern in the Atlantic also has increased predictability as you move from spring to summer. While the Atlantic hurricane starts on June 1, about 95 percent of all major hurricanes occur after August 1.
What Other Seasonal Forecast Resources are There?
Many groups issue seasonal hurricane forecasts besides Colorado State, including government agencies, private sector weather companies and universities. The Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, AXA XL and Colorado State have jointly developed a website that will display seasonal forecasts from over two dozen contributing entities by the start of this years hurricane season.
In its announcement, the Colorado State group said it will update its predictions three times throughout the hurricane season, on June 4, July 2 and August 6.

"For the second time this spring, a powerful, probably historic storm is set to rapidly strengthen in the Plains this week. Like its predecessor, the March bomb cyclone, it is expected to generate blizzard conditions in some areas, and heavy rain, thunderstorms and flooding in others, along with a sprawling area of high winds.
Despite the calendar drifting deeper into April, the biggest story from this storm sequel might be the predicted heavy and wind-blasted snow from South Dakota to southern Minnesota and Wisconsin. But thats just part of the story.
To the south of the snow in the Great Plains, the potent winds may also whip up fires.
Severe thunderstorms are also likely near the storm center in Kansas and Nebraska, as is additional flooding into the Upper Midwest affecting the Missouri and Mississippi river basins.
The storm rapidly takes shape Tuesday night as a frigid river of air 30,000 feet off the ground moves through the Rockies. Into Wednesday, it spills out over the open Plains, uncorking the cap on a volatile situation.
Pressure at the storms center is expected to drop to 980 millibars or lower. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. Compared to low pressure of 968 millibars associated with the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago in Colorado, this latest storm may be slightly less intense. But its still about as low as pressure gets in the region this time of year.
This powerhouse low will spawn all sorts of significant weather. There are a few main stories to keep an eye on.
A blizzard may develop
Were getting well into April now, but in parts of the Plains and Midwest, its about to look like midwinter. Not unheard of, but not typical.
A large zone from Wyoming to southern Minnesota is already under a winter storm watch, including almost all of South Dakota into northern Nebraska. Much of that area is expecting at least 8 to 12 inches of snow, and some places could see up to two feet or so.
Strong and gusty winds will likely result in blowing snow and perhaps blizzard conditions for some areas, wrote the Weather Prediction Center in its recent outlook for the storm.
While the forecast is still coming into focus, Minneapolis could see a historic April snowfall for a second straight year:

High winds and fire danger
These intense and sprawling storm systems tend to deliver high wind over a large area. In addition to the blizzard risk on the north side, damaging winds are possible, particularly to the south and west of the center.
Critical fire conditions should develop Tuesday in New Mexico, with a sizable fire risk expanding eastward. By Wednesday afternoon, the risk of extreme fire danger increases across the Southern Plains as the storm matures to the north.
This pattern is noted for its association with southern Great Plains wildfire outbreaks, wrote the Storm Prediction Center.
While much of this area has seen vast improvement in drought conditions over the past year, it has been relatively dry in parts of the southern high Plains so far in 2019. Early spring is fire season there.
Widespread areas of winds blowing around 20 to 40 mph are likely in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and some surrounding areas Wednesday. Damaging gusts of 50 to 60 mph or greater will also be possible. Gusty conditions of lesser intensity eventually translate east with the storm into the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley on Thursday and Northeast by Friday.
More flooding potential
Much of the precipitation with this system is expected to fall north of the low as snow. To the south, precipitation is generally light but may add up to a half-inch or an inch in spots.
Some areas of southeast South Dakota, southern Minnesota and northern Iowa plus Nebraska may pick up as much as three inches or more of precipitation in the form of rain and snow. Fortunately, there is no real snow pack left there to melt underneath the additional precipitation anticipated, which made flooding considerably worse a few weeks ago.
Across the nation 34 river gauges are in major flood stage, 55 in moderate and many of those are in the Midwest. With 2 feet of snow (water equivalent of 2 to 4 inches) possible mid to late week - and rapid spring melt starting late weekend - concerns for river more flooding. pic.twitter.com/JJoioSLTU0
— Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) April 8, 2019
Even so, any precipitation is too much for these areas of the Mississippi and Missouri river basins, among others. Whatever falls as snow will melt fairly quickly after the storm.
As one example of many spots still flooding, in Burlington, Iowa, the Mississippi is at major flood stage and expected to rise somewhat into midweek.
Depending on how this new batch of water enters waterways, flooding may get worse in the days ahead, and it is expected to continue to be a long-term issue this spring in the nations midsection.
Severe thunderstorms
Considering all of the other hazards with this storm, it is fortunate that moisture which could fuel widespread severe thunderstorms is relatively lacking for this system.
The moisture feed coming out of the Gulf of Mexico will be somewhat limited.
While the lower moisture content should mean that thunderstorms are not as widespread as they could be, any storms that form could mean business, given the high-end wind shear and energy supplied by this strong low-pressure system.
Right now, the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring parts of northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska for the risk of severe storms Wednesday. A few storms could deliver the threat of hail, strong winds and tornadoes. On Thursday, severe weather may again erupt over parts of the Midwest as the storm heads east.","Like the March “bomb cyclone,” it might set some records.",2019-04-08T17:53:32Z,"Huge spring storm likely to unleash blizzard, high winds, and flooding in the Central U.S. midweek",The Washington Post,1
"Lori Loughlins character faced a dilemma. Her two children had the chance to attend an elite school that promised to put their lives on the fast track, but there was only one problem: Their application wasnt entirely accurate.
In a 1993 episode of the popular sitcom Full House, revived by social media users Tuesday, Becky Katsopolis, played by Loughlin, and her husband, Jesse (John Stamos), are forced to navigate the line between wanting whats best for their children and taking things too far as they try to get their young twin sons accepted to a prestigious preschool. When Jesse realizes his boys likely wont get in, he blatantly lies on the schools application, sending the couple down a path of deception until Becky, known in the show for her prudence, puts a stop to the shenanigans. She tells administrators the truth, even at the risk of jeopardizing her childrens futures.
I know you want whats best for them, but you know what? Becky says to Jesse near the end of the episode. Maybe the fast track isnt it. Nicky and Alex are normal, healthy kids and whatever track theyre on, they seem to be doing okay.
She later adds, When theyre ready to go to preschool, well find the right one and well do everything we can to encourage them.
Fast-forward more than 20 years and Loughlin found herself in a strikingly similar situation, only this time it was real life. In 2016, Loughlins eldest daughter was preparing to apply for colleges, but federal prosecutors now allege that instead of leaving things to chance, the actress and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, used bribes to get their daughter into the University of Southern California. They also allegedly did the same for their other daughter, who enrolled in USC last fall.
Loughlin and Giannulli were among 50 people, including Desperate Housewives actress Felicity Huffman, charged Tuesday with allegedly being involved in a bribery scam that allowed privileged students, who otherwise may not have been accepted, to attend prestigious colleges and universities, The Washington Posts Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky reported. The couple are accused of getting their daughters admitted to USC by paying $500,000 for them to be designated as recruits for the universitys rowing team, even though neither of them rowed, according to a criminal complaint.
Representatives for Loughlin and Huffman could not be reached for comment early Wednesday.
[FBI accuses wealthy parents, including celebrities, in college-entrance bribery scheme]
On Tuesday, many fans of Full House pointed out that Loughlins character, widely known as Aunt Becky, appeared to take a rather different approach to school admissions on the show.
Maybe #AuntBecky shouldve taken her own advice, one person tweeted, referencing the Season 6 episode titled, Be True To Your Preschool. The episode is available for streaming on Hulu.
Maybe #AuntBecky should've taken her own advice from the 1993 episode of Full House ""Be True To Your Preschool"" that it doesn't matter what school your kids go to as long as they're happy and well-adjusted.
— Amy (@PrplMnkyCupcake) March 12, 2019
The episodes story line involving Becky and Jesse begins with their twin sons on a play date with another young boy named Cooper. When the conversation between the parents turns to enrolling their children in preschool, Becky and Jesse learn that Cooper has just been accepted to Bouton Hall, one of the best preschools in the area. On the other hand, they are still, as Jesse puts it, in the pre-preschool phase, and havent checked out any schools.
You better get going, Coopers dad warns. The most important choice a parent can make for his child is to pick the right preschool.
At Bouton Hall, kids are put on the right track, guaranteeing that theyre going to be on the fast track for life, the father says.
Thats where we want Nicky and Alex, Jesse responds. The right track, the fast track, zoom.
The camera pans back to show the three boys playing on the grass. Nicky and Alex are making unintelligible baby sounds, and throwing bits of grass in the air. Meanwhile, Cooper has built a rather impressive block tower and starts reciting the ABCs. Jesse looks on, his expression growing increasingly disheartened.
Later, Jesse is confronted with another sign that perhaps Bouton Hall isnt such a good fit for his sons when he sits down to go over the schools daunting application form.
That is a great preschool, remarks his friend Joey Gladstone, played by Dave Coulier. I couldnt get in there and I was 14.
The twins probably wont get in either, Jesse says, referencing an application question that asks the parent to evaluate the scope of your childs verbal skills. Jesse notes that his sons do talk a lot as the boys babble incoherently in the background, but its just not always in English.
Perfect, put down that. Theyre bilingual, Joey suggests. They speak two languages: English and gibberish.
At first, Jesse refuses to lie on the application, but then changes his mind.
Im their father, he says. If I dont lie for them, who will?
Jesses lies appear to pay off as a breathless Becky, who has no idea the application was falsified, tells him that the boys, now bilingual and capable of playing the bassoon, have scored an interview for the school. Its only when they arrive at the school that he comes clean to his wife in an effort to get her to go along with his scheme.
On the application I may have, whats the word Im looking for, I may have embellished a little bit, he admits, reassuring an alarmed Becky that it was minuscule amounts ... just a tad.
But as more of the lies are revealed to Becky throughout the painfully awkward meeting, she quickly reaches her limit.
We have to be honest, well, I have to be honest, she says, interrupting the school administrator. He may have embellished, lied a bit on our application.
It turns out the school had its suspicions all along, as not too many 2-year-olds are proficient on the bassoon, the administrator responds, but surprisingly she allows the entrance interview to proceed. It only shows you want whats best for your boys.
The end of the episode finds a frustrated Jesse trying to practice letters and shapes with his sons, who seem to have no interest at all in what theyre learning. One of the sons even hurls a plastic block at his fathers head.
I think the boys are trying to tell us something, Becky says, before gently reminding Jesse that it doesnt matter where their children go to school or what track they end up on.
I just want them to be happy, Jesse says as he holds one of the twins, who cant stop giggling.
Well, they look pretty happy to me, Becky replies.
On social media, people claimed the episode foreshadowed Tuesdays news about the college admission scam.
An old interview of Loughlin has also resurfaced, in which she spoke about wanting her daughters to go to college.
I want them to be happy, she told Entertainment Tonight in 2016. I want to be supportive of everything they want to do, but I do want them to have somewhat of a normal [life]. Finish out high school, college experience, maybe because I didnt have that, I really want that for them.
[Before Lori Loughlins alleged cheating scandal, daughter Olivia Jade made her life at USC a YouTube brand]
Others, however, were shocked that the woman who played one of TVs most wholesome characters could be accused of a crime. A warrant is reportedly out for Loughlins arrest.
It didnt take long for the initial surprise to wear off and be replaced with a flood of Full House-themed jokes and memes.
One person went so far as to create a new version of the shows catchy theme song, Everywhere You Look.

"* Flood warning, parts of Washington and much of the western half of the area until 10 p.m. *
We knew the longest dry spell since last December had to come to an end at some point. It did so in a big way today, with periods of heavy rainfall that have challenged some records. In our western areas, rainfall near two inches has introduced the potential for flooding this evening, as heavy rain continues. This storm is headed out of here late tonight, but our weather will stay a bit unsettled into Friday.
Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options
Through tonight: Rain will persist into the evening, heavy at times, although it will generally taper as we get past sunset. With one to two inches already common, another inch or so may fall in spots. Particularly in Northern Virginia, the rain may cause some streams to overflow and for water to collect in low-lying areas.
Once we get near and past midnight, we should see rain totally end. Some drizzle might stick around through Friday morning. Lows are mostly in the upper 30s and lower 40s.
View the current weather at The Washington Post.
Tomorrow (Friday): The coastal storm is gone, but a second cold pocket aloft will dive into our area. This should promote some shower development during the day. So, skies will be variably cloudy, and some midday or afternoon raindrops are a risk. There could even be some snow grains or soft hail mixed in at times if activity is strong enough. Highs will be mainly in the mid-50s.

Rain: The tallies are still rising, but we can take stock of where we stand through 4 p.m. Totals are 0.99 inches for D.C., 1.78 inches for Dulles, and 0.85 inches for Baltimore. The total at Dulles has destroyed the old daily record of 1.29 inches. Its racing toward the daily record for all of March as well. The top spot for any day in March at that location since the 1960s is 2.30 inches in 2011.
Dulles is already at 1.78 inches today through 4p with mod rain continuing. Period of record is shorter than DC and Baltimore, but almost six decades long.

"* Flood watch 4 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thursday *
Were smack dab in the middle of winter and just hours removed from a punishing Arctic blast. But, by Thursday morning, temperatures spike to near 60 and springlike downpours may sweep across the Washington region.
The bulk of the rain is expected to fall between about 5 a.m. and noon Thursday. Its a day youll want your rain coat for the commute in and a parka for the trip home as temperatures tumble as the downpours pass.
The trigger for the storminess is a cold front. But before the front arrives, southerly winds will draw up unseasonably mild air and make it feel like March or April.
Temperatures are predicted to rise through the 40s overnight Wednesday and through the 50s by early Thursday morning. Some forecast models project a 7 a.m. temperature of near 60 degrees in Washington, a rise of nearly 30 degrees in 24 hours.
When the cold front collides with this unseasonably mild air Thursday morning, a line of gusty showers may develop embedded within the main area of rain - between around 6 and 9 a.m. We cant even rule out some thunder.
Given frozen ground and heavy rain rates, some instances of flash flooding may occur, says Jeff Halverson, Capital Weather Gangs severe weather expert. Additionally, these showers have the potential to mix down strong winds to the ground, causing gusts in the 40-50 mph range, and perhaps a few isolated gusts exceeding 50 mph.
How much rain are we talking about? The National Weather Service says amounts should average around an inch, with isolated totals up to 1.5 to 2 inches.
Here are the amounts projected from several different models in Washington:
GFS model: 1.5 inches
NAM model: 1.3 inches
High-resolution NAM model: 0.9 inches
HRRR model: 0.9 inches
European model: 1.1. inches
Canadian model: 1.2 inches
High-resolution Canadian model: 1.4 inches
As the rain comes through and ends Thursday morning into the early afternoon, temperatures are forecast to steadily fall - back into the 40s by midday and 30s by sunset.
So after rising 20 degrees overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning, temperatures may then fall 20 degrees during the day.

"2018 was the wettest year on record across the Washington region. All three of the official climate stations D.C., Baltimore and Dulles reached a new high water mark, in addition to many other spots.
A location in the suburbs of Baltimore took it a step farther. Catonsville, Md., posted 84.56 inches of precipitation in the calendar year.
Last week, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrations State Climate Extremes Committee met and voted in favor of declaring Catonsvilles seven feet of rain a new Maryland state record for annual precipitation.
The measurement was made by volunteer weather observer Tom Atkins, a participant in the CoCoRaHS network. CoCoRaHS stands for Community Collaborative Rain, Hail &amp; Snow Network and is composed of thousands of citizen scientists who gather precipitation data, many in their backyards.
Considering that there are only a few hundred official NOAA sites for measuring precipitation, the supplemental observations provided by CoCoRaHS volunteers are critical for filling gaps in an otherwise patchwork network.
The Baltimore Sun profiled Atkins and his CoCoRaHS setup in February. It reported that the National Weather Service had visited Atkins home to inspect his rain gauge and its surroundings but didnt see anything amiss. 
Atkins, according to the Sun, received 9.47 inches of rain in a single day from the same extreme event which engulfed nearby Ellicott City in a second 1,000-year flood in three years. That exceptional rainfall helped Catonsville make Maryland climate history.
Catonsvilles 84.56 inches bests the previous Maryland annual precipitation record of 78.32 inches. The old high mark was recorded in 1903 in a northern Maryland location known as Bachmans Valley, to the north of Westminster just miles from the Pennsylvania border.
Several other locations in Maryland also surpassed that old 1903 total, including sites near Thurmont and Mechanicsville. Both locations had precipitation amounts topping 80 inches in 2018.
Maryland was not the only state to set a new annual maximum precipitation record in 2018. It was quite wet more broadly both in the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Upper Midwest:
The new record in Maryland, as in other places, was boosted by a number of massive rainfalls. For example, in neighboring Washington, there were a record number of days (24) with at least one inch of rainfall. The abundance of extremely rainy days and the widespread repeated nature of such soaking rainfall was generally consistent with expectations in a warming world.","Boosted by exceptional rainfall from the same event which flooded Ellicott City, Catonsville set a new Maryland state precipitation record in 2018.",2019-03-26T18:03:24Z,This Baltimore suburb’s seven feet of rain set a new state record for Maryland in 2018,The Washington Post,0
"Richmond, Virginia (CNN)When Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam admitted he appeared in a racist yearbook photo from the 1980s, several high-profile Democrats quickly called for the once popular Virginia Democrat to resign.
Now, Democrats are facing two more scandals rocking top members of their party in the state: Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has been accused by a college professor of sexual assault and Attorney General Mark Herring is reeling after he admitted that he appeared in blackface at a 1980 party. Prominent Democrats, including those running or thinking about running for president in 2020, have responded to these scandals with relative caution.
Many Democrats have called for an investigation into Fairfax for what they view as a credible allegation made against him but have stopped short of calling for a resignation. Vanessa Tyson said Wednesday that Fairfax sexually assaulted her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax has vehemently denied the allegation.
Democrats' approach to the scandal highlights a tension inside a Democratic Party that has focused on combating gender inequality and tied itself to the #MeToo movement. Fairfax is viewed as a rising star within the party, and many Democrats were excited at the prospect of him becoming the nation's only black governor in the event Northam stepped down.
And many Democrats have yet to address Herring, a contrast to the so far unheeded calls for Northam to resign.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, along with South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg all called on Northam to step down within roughly 24 hours of the governor admitting he was in the racist yearbook photo under his name that featured a person in blackface and another person in a KKK robe and hood. (Northam later denied he was in the photo.)
The group of senators have all taken a more wait-and-see approach on the graphic sexual assault allegation against Fairfax.
""I have not read the allegations, but it takes tremendous courage for someone to come forward in the way that she did,"" Booker said about Tyson's allegations against Fairfax. ""This is a deeply disturbing allegation that should be thoroughly investigated.""
Warren told reporters on Capitol Hill that more needed to come out about Fairfax.
""We will learn more about that, but it doesn't change the fact that Northam needs to resign,"" she said.
Harris said Thursday she thinks there should be an investigation into what happened surrounding the allegations against. 
""But certainly her (the accuser's) letter reads as -- it's quite detailed and suggests there's credibility there."" 
Klobuchar told reporters that she believes ""you need to look at the facts of each case.""
Gillibrand, during a taping of the ""Lovett or Leave It"" podcast, calls for the allegations into Fairfax to be investigated.
""I think the fact that Dr. Tyson came forward took enormous courage. And you can tell from her statement that it causes her great, great trauma to relive the worst moment of her life,"" she said, according to a transcript provided to CNN. ""So I think there has to be a full investigation, I thought her story was deeply disturbing and credible so there must be an investigation.""
Sanders was dogged by reporters on Wednesday about Fairfax and at one point dodged questions while on the phone
""Excuse me, I am on the phone,"" he said.
Castro and Buttigieg responded to the allegations against Fairfax on television shows on Wednesday.
""I read through Dr. Tyson's statement, and I'm inclined to believe her statement. I believe that it's credible. Now he has denied that,"" Castro said. ""My hope is that there will be some process to get to the bottom of that. He has said that, now he's saying that he takes it seriously. I think that we should all take it seriously.""
Buttigieg responded to the now two racist incidents engulfing Northam and Herring by saying there is a ""relationship between racism in America's past and racism in America's present.""
""I mean, it's shocking that we're dealing with three at once in the state of Virginia. It's also clear that each one has its own dynamics and I think that's one of the reasons each one has aroused a different set of responses,"" he said.
Biden and Bloomberg, two possible 2020 candidates who tweeted calls for Northam to go shortly after the photo was made public, have yet to weigh in on the allegations against Fairfax and the admission by Herring.
The caution is not unique to national Democrats, either.
Democrats in Virginia's Capitol building on Wednesday, some of whom were quick to respond to Northam's controversy by calling for him to go, dodged reporters asking about Fairfax and Herring. Some threw their hands in the air, others acted like they didn't hear the questions. 
That includes the influential Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, whose initial call for Northam to resign opened the flood gates on the calls for Northan's ouster.
Delegate Charniele Herring, a member of the black caucus, said Thursday that she would not comment on the allegations against Fairfax and didn't know of any plans for the caucus to investigate the allegations into the lieutenant governor.
""We are focused on the budget and I am working hard to make sure we can get our people elected in the fall,"" she said.
When pressed if she was concerned about the allegations against Fairfax she said she believes ""all allegations like this should be taken seriously"" before ducking into a private room.""
Delegate Eileen Filler-Corn echoed a focus on legislation when asked about Fairfax and Herring.
""It has been a very tough week, to say the least. A lot of serious issues to focus on,"" she said. ""But we really are here to do our jobs, we are here to governor, we are here to legislative, so we are very much focused on the bills and, today more specifically, the budget.""
Two of Virginia's most senior statesmen -- US Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner -- took a more cautious approach to Northam, only calling for his resignation after his bizarre press conference on Saturday where the governor denied being in the racist photo but admitted to dressing in blackface at another time.
Kaine said Wednesday that he needs more information on Fairfax and Herring before making a decision on whether they should go.
""It's just too soon. We're just still processing this, you know? We reached - I reached a conclusion about Governor Northam about 24 hours after the news broke,"" he said.
Warner expressed a similar sentiment.
""This has obviously been an extraordinarily challenging week for all Virginians. I think regardless where we stand, there needs to be a moment of our Commonwealth coming together,"" he said, adding that he was ""shocked and disappointed. ""
""I'm still processing it,"" Warner said. ""I have not even had a chance to review his statements... it's obviously been a challenging week.""","When Virginia Gov.

"A tiny fraction of Twitter users spread the vast majority of fake news in 2016, with conservatives and older people sharing misinformation more, a new study finds.
Scientists examined more than 16,000 U.S. Twitter accounts and found that 16 of them less than one-tenth of 1 percent tweeted out nearly 80 percent of the misinformation masquerading as news, according to a study Thursday in the journal Science . About 99 percent of the Twitter users spread virtually no fake information in the most heated part of the election year, said study co-author David Lazer, a Northeastern University political and computer science professor.
Spreading fake information ""is taking place in a very seamy, but small, corner of Twitter,"" Lazer said.
Lazer said misinformation ""super sharers"" flood Twitter: an average of 308 pieces of fakery each between Aug. 1 and Dec. 6 in 2016.
And it's not just few people spreading it, but few people reading it, Lazer said.
""The vast majority of people are exposed to very little fake news despite the fact that there's a concerted effort to push it into the system,"" Lazer said.
The researchers found the 16,442 accounts they analyzed by starting with a random pool of voter records, matching names to Twitter users and then screening out accounts that appeared to not be controlled by real people.
Their conclusions are similar to a study earlier this month that looked at the spread of false information on Facebook. It also found that few people shared fakery, but those who did were more likely to be over 65 and conservatives.
That makes this study more believable because two groups of researchers using different social media platforms, measuring political affiliation differently and with different panels of users came to the same conclusion, said Yonchai Benkler, co-director of Harvard Law School's center on the internet and society. He wasn't part of either study but praised them, saying they should reduce misguided postelection panic about how ""out-of-control technological processes had rendered us as a society incapable of telling truth from fiction.""
Experts say a recent showdown between Kentucky Catholic school students and a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial seemed to be stoked by a single now-shut down Twitter account. Lazer said the account fit some characteristics of super sharers from his study but it was more left-leaning, which didn't match the study.
Unlike the earlier Facebook study, Lazer didn't interview the people but ranked people's politics based on what they read and shared on Twitter.
The researchers used several different sources of domains for false information masquerading as news not individual stories but overall sites from lists compiled by other academics and BuzzFeed. While five outside experts praised the study, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, head of the public policy center at the University of Pennsylvania, found several problems, especially with how they determined fake information sites.
Lazer's team found that among people they categorized as left-leaning and centrists, fewer than 5 percent shared any fake information. Among those they determined were right-leaning, 11 percent of accounts shared misinformation masquerading as news. For those on the extreme right, it was 21 percent.
This study shows ""most of us aren't too bad at circulating information, but some of us are determined propagandists who are trying to manipulate the public sphere,"" said Texas A&amp;M University's Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of political rhetoric who wasn't part of the study.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has extended until Feb. 1 its investigation into measures required to prevent a surge of steel imports following the U.S. imposition of metal tariffs. 
The Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 28-member European Union, has already set a quota and tariff system to counter concerns that steel products no longer exported to the United States will instead flood European markets. 
The “safeguard” system is provisional pending the conclusion of the Commission’s investigation, which was due to have ended nine months after its start on March 26. 
However, EU rules allow it to extend an investigation by up to two months in exceptional circumstances. The Commission said the size of the investigation, with 28 product categories and over 800 interested parties registered, was unprecedented. 
The Commission said in the EU official journal this counted as exceptional circumstances. The fact that temporary measures were already in place meant an extension would not have a negative impact. 
Definite measures, if they are to be adopted, would now have to be in place by Feb. 1. 
The current safeguards involve quotas for different steel products, set at the average of imports for the past three years, with a 25 percent tariff set for volumes exceeding these amounts. 
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, said last week it was “absolutely” critical that Europe extend the protection measures and remedy weaknesses, such as exemptions for developing countries. 
The main exporters of steel to the EU are China, India, Russia, South Korea, Turkey and Ukraine.

"NHAMPUEPUA, Mozambique (Reuters) - Fulai Joaquim has enough food to feed his 10 children for another week, maybe two. Then, he says, it is in the hands of God. 
A cyclone ripped his cassava crop from the ground, leaving the roots to rot in the field, and the floods that followed washed away his maize. 
“There have been a lot of tears,” said Joaquim, 45, as he trudged past the small plots of land that hug the mud and stick homes of Nhampuepua, also destroyed by the storm. “Everyone is hungry.” 
Hundreds of rural communities were plunged into food crisis after Cyclone Idai tore through central Mozambique on March 14, humanitarian workers say. The government estimates that more than 700,000 hectares of agricultural land was flooded, leaving many farmers with nothing to harvest. 
From the air, the kilometers (miles) of flattened crops look like thinning, slicked-back hair. 
More than 750 people died in the storm and heavy rains before it hit Mozambique and two other southern African countries, Zimbabwe and Malawi. 
Two weeks later, as search and rescue operations wind down, the focus is shifting to feeding the survivors. 
Maize imports to Mozambique could double this year from the usual 100,000 tonnes, said Wandile Sihlobo, an economist with the South African agribusiness association, Agbiz. How that might impact prices is uncertain. 
“Food-security-wise, it’s been devastating,” the World Food Programme’s director for Southern Africa, Lola Castro, told Reuters at the airport in the cyclone-hit port city of Beira. 
“We have to scale up fast.” 
WFP has delivered food aid to some 200,000 Mozambicans and aims to reach a million in the next two weeks, Castro said. 
But that is not enough. Farmers also need seeds to re-plant as quickly as possible. 
“It needs to be done yesterday,” Castro said. 
AID NOT ENOUGH 
The storm could not have come at a worse time, barely a month before the main maize harvest, the region’s principal crop. 
In countless villages, Reuters saw households desperately trying to dry green, unripe cobs salvaged from the flood waters. But villagers said eating the cobs was making them ill. 
In Bebedo, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Beira, dozens of families came out to see a Russian-made helicopter land in a cloud of dust, carrying a WFP delivery of fortified food. 
Within 20 minutes, they had carried more than a hundred brown boxes of Plumpy’sup, a fortified peanut paste used to treat malnutrition in young children, as well as white sacks containing a soy and corn flour blend. 
It was the second delivery that day. The village is being used as a distribution center to feed neighboring communities 17,000 mouths in all. 
But residents said Nhampuepua, an hour and a half’s drive from Beira, was falling through the cracks. The only aid that had reached there by Saturday was donated by a local petrol company. 
Nhampuepua’s suffering highlights the scale of the task confronting humanitarian agencies and the government. 
The United Nations humanitarian coordination agency, which is overseeing the disaster response, estimates that 1.85 million people scattered across an area of 3,000 square kilometers - roughly the size of Luxembourg - were affected by the storm in Mozambique alone. 
PRICES UP, INCOME DOWN 
The subsistence farmers of Nhampuepua, hardened by years of poverty, are already replanting what they can, using cuttings from the uprooted cassava plants that now litter the village. 
But the land has its rhythm and will not be rushed, however great the need. Only in eight months will the cassava be ready to eat. 
Until then, hunger is a real threat. 
On Saturday, Diniz Jeronimo, 28, and his family of five shared a bowl of plain boiled spaghetti for their only meal. 
Their crops were devastated. Like most of the community, the family’s only immediate income comes from selling charcoal, which takes seven days to make. 
On the slow, sandy road to Dondo, the nearest town, a stream of bicycles carried sacks of the fuel. Now Diniz is worried the price will come down. 
At the same time, the cost of food has shot up. 
A 25-kilogram sack of corn flour that sold for 850 Mozambican meticais ($13) before the cyclone now sells for 1,200 meticais, villagers said. 
President Filipe Nyusi, who described the storm as one of the worst natural disasters in Mozambique’s memory, said during a visit to Beira last week that 100,000 agricultural tools and 1,000 tonnes of seed for short-cycle crops would be distributed to help get farmers back on their feet. 
But the devastated villagers around Dondo and Nhamatanda had not received anything as of Saturday and were doubtful they ever would. 
In Nhampuepua, Joaquim said he would travel to Dondo that afternoon to buy corn flour. That would keep his children fed for now, at least. 
“It’s a new world,” he said. “Everything needs to be made again.” 
 ($1 = 63.1300 meticais)

"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE Nov. 19, 2018 / 7:14 PM GMT Twin storms are headed for rural Northern California this week, bringing conditions that could both help and hinder efforts to put out the Camp Fire, the deadliest blaze in the state's history, officials said Monday. Heavy downpours are predicted for Paradise, California, and surrounding areas, where at least 77 people have been killed in the wildfire thats been raging for nearly two weeks, authorities said. The first rains are expected to hit on Wednesday morning and to continue until a brief respite on Thursday afternoon or evening, according to NBC meteorologist Kathryn Prociv. Then another round of showers is forecast to come Friday and last through Saturday morning, with the two storms together bringing between at least 1 inch and as much as 3 inches of rain, Prociv added. The precipitation itself wont put out the fire, but could moisten the earth and slow the killer blazes spread, Sacramento City Fire Capt. Keith Wade told NBC News on Monday. Will it (rain) extinguish the fire? No. But it could hinder its ability to spread, said Wade, who is in Butte County helping local firefighters. The problem could be if rain totals push beyond 3 inches. That's when rivers and streams could flood, and rain-soaked earth could become mud capable of trapping firetrucks. This could bring difficulties in moving equipment in and out of the area and how crews can operate in remote areas. The rain changes everything, Wade said. Its (the rain) definitely a mix. The Camp Fire has been burning since Nov. 8 and has charred at least 151,000 acres and leveled virtually the entire town of Paradise, authorities said. It was 66 percent contained as of Monday morning. At least 11,371 homes and 472 businesses have burned down.","Between 1 inch and 3 inches of rain are expected to fall around Butte County in Northern California, which could both help and hurt the fight to put down the killer Camp Fire",2018-11-19T19:14:00Z,Heavy rain headed for Northern California could help and hurt battle against deadly Camp Fire,NBC News,1
"BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Rockefeller Foundation is changing the focus of its funding of projects to strengthen societies against modern pressures such as climate change, shifting away from preparing cities to a broader global view of the issue, its president said on Monday. 
The change means it will stop financial backing of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) network - about $165 million over five years - that enabled more than 80 cities to hire chief resilience officers and develop action plans, Rajiv Shah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. 
The program has succeeded in pushing cities to think about how to cope with risks such as extreme weather and pollution, he said. 
“That work has been transformational in helping urban areas really address the challenges that are only going to get more intense as we go forward in time,” Shah said. 
Efforts supported by 100RC have helped Jakarta manage waste, protected Bangkok riverside communities from flooding and turned Parisian schoolyards into cool oases during heat waves, he said. 
The U.S.-based philanthropic foundation will provide a further $12 million this year to help the network transform into an independent organization. 
The foundation also plans to keep working with U.S. city mayors to find ways to boost jobs and economic opportunities while adapting to climate change, Shah said. 
“These are exceptional leaders who are taking forward and institutionalizing these efforts, with our continued support,” he said. 
On Monday, 86 staff in 100RC’s four offices - New York, London, Singapore and Mexico City - were told their jobs would finish on July 31. 
The end of support by the Rockefeller Foundation contrasts with a 2017 speech by its president, in which he referred to “our strong and continued commitment” to the 100RC initiative “for many, many years to come”. 
In December, an independent evaluation of 100RC’s work by the Urban Institute, a U.S.-based policy research group, gave a broadly positive account of progress. 
It said 100RC cities were adopting holistic planning practices widely and “de-siloing” operations to tackle social, economic and physical challenges. 
It also found 100RC was among the first global initiatives to use a consistent set of tools, assistance and resources across diverse cities “for which no alternative exists”. 
An open letter by 100RC President Michael Berkowitz, issued on Monday, said the organization would use a July summit in Rotterdam to chart a path forward for the urban resilience movement. 
“Our work will continue in new ways and we look forward to being part of this important movement for years to come,” he wrote. 
DISASTER RECOVERY 
On Monday, The Rockefeller Foundation also announced a $30 million grant to the Washington, D.C.-based Adrienne Arsht Center for Resilience at the Atlantic Council. 
The money will support its work helping individuals, cities and communities across the globe become better able to weather more severe, growing risks such as flood, drought, conflict and food insecurity in “an uncertain, rapidly changing world”. 
The council said it would look at policy frameworks, advancement of finance and risk mechanisms and use of technology and communications tools and platforms. 
Shah said the Atlantic Council had high-level relationships in political and financial circles, allowing it to team up with banks, insurance firms and others on resilience-building initiatives. 
In the past decade, The Rockefeller Foundation has put nearly $500 million into climate change and resilience initiatives, ranging from 100RC to village-level renewable energy projects in India and a U.S. forest conservation effort. 
It sees value in investments that “both include and go beyond the urban planning support”, and is “particularly enthusiastic about our work on post-disaster recovery”, Shah said. 
Rockefeller has made strides in that area, he added, convening governments, businesses and civil society leaders to report on how Puerto Rico could rebuild after Hurricane Maria in 2017. 
That included innovative financing for solar panels to be installed on community centers and hospitals to keep running in future storms. 
The foundation is now exploring ways to help southern Africa recover after Cyclone Idai, aiming to help local producers and businesses restore food supplies. 
It will also set up a new office to build climate resilience into key areas of its work, including food security, health care and clean power. 
In 2017 and 2018, the Thomson Reuters Foundation received funding from The Rockefeller Foundation to report on efforts to build resilience to shocks and stresses worldwide.

"Chicago — R&amp;B singer R. Kelly walked into a Chicago courtroom on Monday wearing an orange jail jumpsuit for a hearing in his sexual abuse case after spending the weekend in jail as confidants tried to pay $100,000 to get him released. Kelly, one of the best-selling music artists of all time, was arrested late Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were minors. A judge on Saturday set bond at $1 million, requiring the Grammy Award-winning singer to pay 10 percent.
At Monday's hearing, Kelly's case was assigned to the judge who would preside over the trial, Cook County Associate Judge Lawrence Flood. Kelly clasped his hands behind his back and was not handcuffed during the five-minute hearing, reports CBS News' Jericka Duncan and Cassandra Gauthier. Defense attorney Steve Greenberg said Kelly would enter a plea of not guilty and waived a formal reading of charges. Greenberg told Duncan and Gauthier that Kelly ""hopes"" to post bond sometime Monday afternoon.
R. Kelly faces 10 counts of sexual abuse
The walls began closing in on Kelly  after the release of a BBC documentary about him last year and the multipart Lifetime documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which aired last month. Together they detailed allegations that he held women against their will and ran a ""sex cult.""
Last month, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx asked for possible alleged victims of sexual assault or domestic violence by Kelly to come forward after what she called the ""deeply, deeply disturbing"" allegations outlined in the docu-series.
Speaking on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday, filmmaker Dream Hampton, who produced the docu-series, said she didn't expect Kelly to face charges. In a tweet Friday, Hampton said, ""The survivors are heroes.""
Greenberg has said confidants were making arrangements to pay the $100,000 bail needed to free him as he awaits trial. Kelly told a judge ""yes, sir"" when reminded that a condition of his bond requires him to have no contact with minors, Duncan and Gauthier report.
Speaking Friday after Kelly's arrest, Greenberg accused the women of ""lying"" and slammed Foxx for bringing the charges.
""Unfortunately the State's Attorney has now succumbed to public pressure, to pressure from grand-standers like Michael Avenatti and Gloria Allred, and brought these charges. Mr. Kelly is strong. He's got a lot of support, and he's going to be vindicated on all these charges, one by one if it has to be.""
Avenatti, who said he represents two Kelly victims, said his legal team will give prosecutors a second video on Monday that he alleges shows Kelly sexually assaulting a minor. The lawyer has said he recently gave prosecutors video evidence of the singer having sex with an underage girl. Avenatti told CBS News this month he got the first tape from someone who knows both Kelly and the alleged victim ""extremely well."" He described it as a ""bombshell of epic proportions.""
In arguing for bail within the singer's ability to pay, Greenberg told a judge over the weekend that Kelly wasn't wealthy despite decades of success creating hit songs. The lawyer blamed mismanagement, bad contracts and other issues for his client's financial woes.
There are multiple logistical issues that could have thwarted Kelly's efforts to pay over the weekend, said Joseph Lopez, a criminal defense attorney in Chicago not connected to the Kelly case. He said court officials must be able to talk to bank officials directly to confirm that an amount written on a check is covered, and that's not possible when banks are closed.
R. Kelly charged with abusing four victims
""This all happened on Friday. He wasn't really prepared. He was surprised. Then Saturday, by the time we went to bond court, banks were closed,"" Greenberg told CBS Chicago.
Greenberg also said Kelly owes more than $161,000 in unpaid child support, but that won't have an impact on his ability to bond out of jail.
""They can't hold you in jail on a criminal case because you haven't paid child support. He's going to take care of the child support also. He's been paying child support for years and years. It's only recently he fell he fell a little bit behind,"" Greenberg told the station.
Records on the Cook County sheriff's website show Kelly is in Division 8 of the county jail, where the medical unit is located but also where inmates considered at risk from the general inmate population are held, Lopez said.
Disturbing details of the allegations against Kelly emerged Saturday when the prosecution released four detailed documents — one for each accuser — outlining the basis for the charges. The allegations date back as far as 1998 and span more than a decade.
A 16-year-old girl who attended Kelly's child pornography trial in 2008 got his autograph after a court session. He later invited her to his home in the Chicago suburb of Olympia Fields, where they had sex multiple times, according to the documents, which said he also slapped, choked and spit on the girl.
In 1998, another girl reported meeting Kelly at a restaurant where she was having a 16th birthday party. Kelly's manager gave her the singer's business card and suggested she call Kelly. The girl's mother heard the exchange, took the card and told the manager her daughter was 16.
But her daughter later retrieved the card from her purse. She contacted Kelly, who gave her instructions and money that she assumed was for the taxi fare to his studio, where they had sex periodically for a year, the documents said.
In early 2003, a Chicago hairdresser told prosecutors that she thought she was going to braid Kelly's hair, but he pulled down his pants and instead tried to force her to give him oral sex. The woman, who was 24, was able to pull away, but Kelly ejaculated on her and spit in her face, the documents said.
Prosecutors also described a witness who had access to videotapes showing Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. The witness turned a tape over to authorities and identified the girl, who repeatedly stated her age on the footage, according to the documents.
Kelly's DNA was found in semen on one of the accuser's shirts, and semen found on a shirt worn by another was submitted for DNA testing, Foxx said. It was not clear when the accusers turned the shirts over to authorities — whether it was shortly after the abuse or more recently.
At the bond hearing, Greenberg said his client is not a flight risk. He told the judge, ""Contrary to the song, Mr. Kelly doesn't like to fly."" One of Kelly's best-known hits is ""I Believe I Can Fly.""
After the hearing, Greenberg told reporters that Kelly did not force anyone to have sex.
""He's a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex,"" Greenberg said.
The judge ordered Kelly to surrender his passport, ending his hopes of doing a tour of Europe in April. Kelly defiantly scheduled concerts in Germany and the Netherlands despite the cloud of legal issues looming over him. Greenberg denied that any tour was planned.
The recording artist, whose legal name is Robert Kelly, has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct.
Kelly broke into the R&amp;B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, ""12 Play,"" which produced such popular sex-themed songs as ""Your Body's Callin'"" and ""Bump N' Grind."" He rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side and has retained a sizable following. Kelly has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga.
In 2008, a jury acquitted Kelly of child pornography charges that centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13. He and the young woman allegedly seen with him denied they were in the 27-minute video, even though the picture quality was good and witnesses testified it was them, and she did not take the stand. Kelly could have been sentenced to 15 years in prison.
Because the alleged victim 10 years ago denied that she was on the video and did not testify, the state's attorney's office had little recourse except to charge the lesser offense under Illinois law, child pornography, which required a lower standard of evidence.
Each count of the new charges carries up to seven years in prison, and the sentences could be served consecutively, making it possible for him to receive up to 70 years. Probation is also an option.","Singer's lawyer argued he is not a flight risk at a bond hearing: ""Contrary to the song, Mr. Kelly doesn't like to fly""",2019-02-25T16:12:20Z,"R.

"Earlier this month, former Attorney General Eric Holder said Democrats should consider expanding the number of seats on the Supreme Court. While he wasn't the first Democrat to invoke the FDR-era proposal of ""court packing,"" he was arguably the most high profile to float the idea. 
As liberals contemplate the possibility of a conservative majority that could last for a decade or more, given President Trump's appointment of two young conservatives, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, court packing is developing into a major subject of debate. Candidates competing in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary are considering the idea to varying degrees. Some have argued for adding justices to the court, while others have embraced the idea of term limits for justices. Still others have focused on ways to depoliticize what they believe has become a partisan court.
The idea has also invited pushback from critics concerned about the further disruption of institutions and from conservatives who have long seen Supreme Court seats as a mobilizing issue in elections. 
What does ""court packing"" mean, and has it been done before?
Shortly after winning his second presidential term, Franklin Delano Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious overhaul of the Supreme Court. Irritated that he hadn't yet had a chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and frustrated by the high court's habit of striking down his New Deal projects, Roosevelt announced in 1937 that he wanted to bring it out of the ""horse-and-buggy age.""
Under Roosevelt's plan, for every justice who refused to retire within six months of turning 70, the president would be able to appoint a new justice. The plan would allow Roosevelt to appoint as many as six new justices using this mechanism, which would dramatically reshape the court. But the plan divided Democrats and was even criticized by Roosevelt's vice president, John Nance Garner, who worried that it would erode the separation of powers and put the U.S. on the path to dictatorship. 
Nicknamed ""court packing"" by its critics, Roosevelt's plan would die in Congress despite substantial Democratic majorities in both chambers and cost the president much of his political capital. According to Roosevelt's secretary of agriculture and future vice president Henry Wallace, ""the whole New Deal went up in smoke as result of the Supreme Court fight."" 
Why are Democrats talking about this now?
""The reason this is an issue can be summed up in four words: Gore, Garland, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh,"" says Todd Tucker, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. ""The Garland episode was kind of the last straw...that's certainly why the temperature went through the roof.""
Democrats pointed to Republicans' blocking then-President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in their initial opposition to President Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. To confirm Gorsuch, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changed the rules of the upper chamber to require a simple majority support, rather than 60 votes, to get him on the bench. (Under Democratic Leader Harry Reid in the Obama administration, Democrats changed the threshold for executive appointments.)
Republicans have effectively made appointments to the Supreme Court and the judiciary an organizing principle of the party, and saw how their voters coalesced around President Trump on the issue in 2016. And Senate Republicans have been confirming Trump nominated judges at a record pace. After Kavanaugh's confirmation, Democrats have sought to motivate their voters in a similar way, with groups like Demand Justice focused expressly on the courts.
As the 2020 Democratic primary gets underway, candidates have been engaging in a debate about structural changes in order to pass big agenda items on the climate, voting rights, and other issues. ""Half of it is economic and social issues, the other half is, how are you going to get it done?"" says Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of the Indivisible Project. Levin says that ""concern for democracy"" consistently polls among top issues of concern for his group's grassroots members. 
Democrats say such changes are a reflection of a desire to depoliticize the courts. 
""The Supreme Court dismantled the Voting Rights Act, allowed a flood of dark money to corrupt our politics, and permitted hyper-partisan gerrymandering to rig the system against voters,"" said Kate Kendell, campaign manager for the group Pack the Courts. ""Because the Court has undermined the institutions of democracy, court packing is the only way to restore the integrity of the political system.""
What are the candidates proposing?
Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was one of the earlier proponents of expanding the court. He has proposed increasing the number of seats to 15 justices, with five Democratic appointees and five Republicans ones, and an additional five who would be appointed by those 10 justices.
""This central objective that is to prevent the Supreme Court from continuing on this trajectory to become basically ruined by being a nakedly political institution,"" Buttigieg said in an interview with the podcast, ""Pod Save America."" ""This idea of adding justices is one way to do it."" 
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke has also spoken favorably of that proposal, in addition to imposing term limits for justices. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, too, likes the idea of term limits. ""I think I would like to start exploring a lot of options, and we should have an actual conversation term limit for Supreme Court justices might be one thing.  It gives every president the ability to choose three,"" he said in an interview with MSNBC. Such a path would require a constitutional amendment, however, meaning approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate and three-fourths of the states. 
Others have said they wouldn't rule out court expansion. ""We are on the verge of a crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court,"" Kamala Harris told Politico. ""We have to take this challenge head on, and everything is on the table to do that."" Elizabeth Warren also told Politico that the conversation was worth having, and mentioned bringing appellate up to the high court as an option. New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has said that both adding justices and imposing term limits are ideas she would think about. 
Are all Democrats on board? What are their concerns?
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, said she would look at various proposals but said her priority is to get fair and qualified judges through the existing system. 
""One of the problems we've had, even when President Obama came in, there's been a lot of delay to in starting that process,"" Klobuchar told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe. ""I know a lot of people who are qualified people all across the country that I think would make excellent judges, some of whom are left hanging...so I think that is very important to get judges in place immediately.""
And even those open to the idea of changes have expressed concern about escalating partisanship when it comes to the court. Booker told Politico that he would ""really caution people about doing things that become a tit for tat throughout history."" 
""At a time where almost every single democratic institution from the press to the judiciary to the integrity of the ballot box is under attack from without this country and from within this country, I think we have to very soberly decide these issues,"" O'Rourke told CBS News when asked about the impact of making dramatic institutional changes. ""If we were to change the composition of the Supreme Court, that should not be done by Democrats or Republicans. That's a conversation  for the entire country.""
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who is contemplating a 2020 run, said Democrats should focus on winning back the White House to solve issues. In an interview with the Washington Post, he banged his head on the table when asked what he thought about expanding the Supreme Court. ""Having seen up close just how cynical and how vicious the tea party guys and the Freedom Caucus guys and Mitch McConnell have been, the last thing I want to do is be those guys,"" he said. 
But proponents of the idea say the conversation is critical. ""The burning issues of the day require big structural changes to the country's economy and democracy...What you're seeing a lot in this cycle are proposals that envision a longer term trajectory in the country,"" says Tucker, of the Roosevelt Institute. ""We're in the middle of a 10- or 20-year conversation that will hopefully get us to the better place.""","In an effort to change the ideological make-up of the court, Democrats are considering ways to expand the number of justices",2019-03-26T14:38:42Z,Why some Democrats want more justices added to Supreme Court,CBS News,0
"Watch the CBS News special report in the video player above.
Special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election for nearly two years and Sunday, America finally learned at least some of his findings: In a letter to congressional leaders, Attorney General William Barr quotes the report as saying, ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""
But there are still many unanswered questions. Mueller didn't make a determination as to whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation, but Barr said there was insufficient evidence to establish that the president committed obstruction of justice. Democratic lawmakers continue to investigate, and say the full report must be made public.
Why was the special counsel appointed? And why did American voters and elected officials alike come to question if the president of the United States colluded with a foreign government?
The Hacks
It all started with a hack. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Russian hackers gave WikiLeaks 20,000 emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, which WikiLeaks then released. They included private communications of Hillary Clinton's campaign staff, notably Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, emails that continued to be leaked until just prior to election day.
The hackers were intelligence officials working for the Russian government, according to a U.S. indictment, which led some commentators to dub the hack and interference in a U.S. election as ""an attack.""
Only months earlier, U.S. intelligence agencies discovered George Papadopolous, a Mr. Trump campaign aide, had spoken to an overseas contact about his knowledge of Moscow having acquired emails damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Papadopolous was indicted for lying to the FBI, pleaded guilty and served a short jail sentence.
Roger Stone, a self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" and longtime friend of Donald Trump, has since been indicted by federal agents for allegedly lying to Congress about his communications with WikiLeaks. Stone has pleaded not guilty and currently faces trial for making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering. The group of Russian hackers who carried out the plot have also been indicted.
Spy Games
The Russian email hack of the DNC was only one part of an involved and coordinated campaign to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election, one spearheaded by the dissemination of false information aimed to influence millions of American voters.
The Russian election interference was traced back to a physical ""troll factory"" in St. Petersburg that had been set up by Russian agents to be a digital headquarters for their efforts to create social media accounts that would incite division and spread false information among the American voting public.
Starting in 2014, the Russian digital operation, which employed hundreds of people and went by the name Internet Research Agency (IRA), began to track U.S. political trends and create hundreds of fake webpages and social media accounts, where it posted false political advertisements and denigrated certain candidates, notably Hillary Clinton.
Tradecraft
Russian election interference did not end on the internet. On June 9, 2016, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, at her request. Trump Jr. had been informed by email prior to the meeting that Veselnitskaya might be able to offer him compromising information on Hillary Clinton, an allegation which he later denied and then admitted.
U.S. intelligence agencies also discovered Mr. Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the 2016 campaign.
Paul Manafort was Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman and federal investigators uncovered his lobbying work on behalf of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. They also discovered that on August 2, 2016, Manafort shared polling data with Russian operative Konstantin Kilimnik.
Manafort has been sentenced to serve more than seven years in prison stemming from guilty verdicts in two separate cases — one for tax fraud and bank fraud relating to his work in Ukraine, and another for conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Manafort faces additional charges by prosecutors in New York relating to mortgage fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records.
Michael Flynn and the FBI
Before taking the oath of office, Mr. Trump had been warned by President Barack Obama against hiring Michael Flynn. Flynn worked under Obama as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014, when he was fired. 
Mr. Trump chose Flynn to be his National Security adviser, but had to force him to resign weeks into his presidency after it was revealed Flynn lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russian foreign minister Sergey Kislyak during the transition and his business ties to foreign governments. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
After allegedly telling FBI Director James Comey privately that Flynn ""is a good guy,"" and saying he hoped Comey ""can let this go,"" Mr. Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, setting off a chain of events that would change the course of his administration.
When asked by NBC News' Lester Holt why he fired Comey, Mr. Trump answered, ""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'""
Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel in wake of the Comey firing, where he was given the broad mandate to investigate ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and ... any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.""
Andrew McCabe, FBI acting-Director at the time of the Comey firing, would later tell ""60 Minutes"" he briefly discussed whether there were the votes in the cabinet for invoking the 25th Amendment with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a complex constitutional procedure designed to remove the president from office in the event that he or she ""is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" In a statement, The Justice Department said, ""As the Deputy Attorney General previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was the [deputy attorney general] in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.""
All the President's Men
With the special counsel's investigation growing and James Comey's Senate Intelligence Committee testimony emboldening Democrats, the White House hired a powerful legal team to defend Mr. Trump. 
Lawyers Ty Cobb, John Dowd and Jay Sekulow were brought in to assist White House Counsel Don McGahn, with Cobb publicly stating his belief that the Mueller investigation would be wrapped up early. After Cobb, Dowd, and McGahn departed, Emmet Flood, a legal veteran from Bill Clinton's impeachment defense, was added along with Rudy Giuliani, who proceeded to make headlines on Sunday morning talk shows, at one point telling NBC's Chuck Todd that ""Truth isn't truth."" 
Through it all, Trump and his defense team maintained his innocence, stating alternatively that there was ""no collusion,"" to ""collusion is not a crime"" to ""there is no evidence Donald Trump knew anything.""  
The Fixer
No member of Donald Trump's political orbit generated more controversy than Michael Cohen, the president's former personal attorney and self-proclaimed ""fixer."" Cohen has claimed he and Trump coordinated hush-money payments to two women, adult firm star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who each claim they had affairs with Trump, and that these payments were made to influence the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws in connection with these payments.
Cohen has also claimed he tried to cut a deal for the building of a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 election, before that fell apart. In blockbuster testimony to Congress in February, Cohen publicly accused Trump of criminal conduct and racism, calling him ""a con man"" and ""a cheat."" 
While Cohen begins a three-year prison sentence in May for violating campaign finance law, his allegations remain at the center of an ongoing investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York, which is investigating Mr. Trump's alleged campaign finance violations, Trump Organization financial dealings, and possible illegal donations to the Trump inaugural committee.
What's Next
Now that the conclusions of the Muller report have been released, Democrats and Republicans are bracing for their next steps in a bitter political dispute. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-New York, has opened up an investigation into President Trump's administration, seeking emails, memos, and financial documents from 81 entities and individuals connected to Trump. 
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said it was time for the country to ""move on"" and ""get ready to combat Russia"" in the 2020 elections. Rep. Jim Jordan, an ally of Mr. Trump's in the House, simply tweeted: ""No collusion! No obstruction! It's time to move on.""","Monday night's CBS News special, ""The Mueller Report: A Turning Point,"" unpacks the two-year investigation",2019-03-25T16:29:08Z,The Mueller Report: A Turning Point,CBS News,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s announced plan to name economic commentator Stephen Moore and businessman Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve board has come with assertions by the president the central bank is undermining economic growth and with demands from him for lower interest rates. 
Both Moore and Cain are more overtly partisan than most previous nominees to the Fed, and Trump has been unusually critical of recent Fed decisions. 
Here are the top issues at the heart of Trump’s beef with the Fed and his own hand-picked chairman, Jerome Powell: 
Q) Is the Fed trying to slow the economy? 
A) No. Policymakers say the U.S. economy is healthy enough to stand on its own, without the explicit central bank help reserved for more fragile economic conditions. 
Trump has been frustrated that the Fed raised rates four times in 2018 as his signature tax policy went into effect. In all, seven of the Fed’s nine rate hikes since 2015 occurred after Trump took office in January 2017. 
If not for that, he says, the economy would be performing like a “rocket ship” today instead of likely ebbing from last year’s 3 percent growth rate. 
Still, the current level of interest rates in a range of 2.25 and 2.5 percent remains low relative to historical norms. Fed officials regard that level as near “neutral,” meaning it isn’t explicitly discouraging spending and investment, and from their perspective the rate hikes are not meant to impede the economy. 
Q) Inflation is weak, so why did the Fed raise rates at all? 
A) While inflation control is at the center of the Fed’s mission, Fed officials also set monetary policy in anticipation of other factors that can affect the outlook for the economy. 
In the middle of last year it seemed the economy was poised to grow faster than expected for a while. A majority of Fed policymakers reasoned that keeping rates too low in that environment could pose other risks even if inflation remained tame. A chief concern was that low borrowing costs could create financial bubbles, which remains a core concern for policymakers after the financial crisis a decade ago. 
To Powell and other officials, the issue is not just hitting the highest level of growth possible in any given year or quarter, it is hitting the highest level of growth that seems sustainable over time. 
Q) Is the Fed overlooking different risks, like weaker overseas growth or financial market volatility, that would argue for lower interest rates? 
A) Administration officials, and most recently White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, said the administration is worried the Fed was ignoring other issues, such as slowing growth in China or the state of financial markets. 
But throughout last year there was a growing group of officials inside the Fed concerned about just those problems. 
That group reached critical mass in December as falling stock prices and widening credit market spreads fueled a rapid tightening of financial conditions. Even as the Fed raised rates that month, the central bank also began to shift gears and put further interest rates on hold. 
Q) Is the Fed wedded to an outmoded economic view in which growth and low unemployment cause inflation? 
A) Moore has said the Fed is stocked with “growth-phobiacs,” while Kudlow has argued the Fed holds a mistaken allegiance to the “Phillips curve” - an economic model measuring the relationship between employment levels and inflation. In their view, the Fed is overly concerned that if U.S. unemployment - currently near its lowest in five decades - falls too far that inflation will spike. 
The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is the subject of a longstanding debate at the Fed. Current officials now appear more open to seeing just how low the jobless rate can go without wages and eventually prices rising too fast. 
Such a less-rigid approach comes with risks, however, and today’s Fed leaders remain mindful of past episodes when the Fed allowed unemployment to get too low for too long, as it did under political pressure in the 1960s. 
That choice, when jobless rates were far below what was considered “full employment,” helped spark the runaway inflation of the 1970s, and forced subsequent Fed officials to impose some of the most punishing, and recessionary, interest rates ever. 
Q) The president has been critical about more than just interest rates. What does that mean for things like “quantitative easing” and “quantitative tightening”? 
A) Trump recently urged the Fed to return to the “quantitative easing” policies used during the crisis years. Under QE, the central bank gobbled up trillions of dollars in government securities to flood the financial system with cash and hold down long-term interest rates. 
The policy was controversial at the time, and the Fed has since winnowed its holdings down. While that process - nicknamed “quantitative tightening” - will soon end along with the rate hikes, no one at the central bank thinks they should fire QE up again. 
Indeed, with unemployment below 4 percent and the economy still growing, Trump’s call for additional QE has more in common with policies championed by some of the further left Democrats - those he brands socialists - than with the typical views of the Republican party.

"(Reuters) - A shutdown of about a quarter of the U.S. government rolled into its 12th day on Wednesday, with lawmakers and President Donald Trump divided over his demand for money for a border wall. 
The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is the 19th to occur since the mid-1970s. Most have been brief. Trump’s latest is the third on the Republican president’s watch and already ranks among the longest ever. 
A meeting on the shutdown at the White House with senior lawmakers was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. 
There were several very short shutdowns under Republican President Ronald Reagan. Under Democratic President Bill Clinton, there were two shutdowns, including the longest on record: 21 days in 1996. 
A 16-day shutdown happened under Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013 in a fight with Republicans over his healthcare law. 
The current shutdown has not affected three-quarters of the government, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, which have secure funding. But 800,000 employees from the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation and other agencies have been furloughed or are working without pay. 
Here is what is happening around the federal government. 
SMITHSONIAN 
The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo in Washington are closed due to the shutdown, according to the Smithsonian website. Among these is the popular National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016. “The museum is closed due to the federal government shutdown. Timed entry pass holders will be emailed instructions on how to reschedule their visit,” the museum posted on Instagram. 
HOMELAND SECURITY 
The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected. But most employees are “essential,” so they are working without pay until a funding bill is passed. 
Of 245,000 agency employees, nearly 213,000 have been deemed “essential,” according to the department’s contingency plan. 
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) 
Most of this department’s 7,500 employees are “non-essential;” only about 340 are working. Nearly 1,000 others may be called in for specific tasks, without pay. 
Public housing authorities and Native American tribal housing entities are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down. But the federal government provides some of their funding, so they may need to reduce or change operating hours. 
HUD, which oversees some housing loan and low-income housing payment programs, warned in its contingency plan that “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we’ve been experiencing.” 
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT 
The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau are not publishing economic data, including key figures on gross domestic product, inflation, personal income, spending, trade and new home sales, during the shutdown. 
OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
The agency that oversees the federal workforce has given advice to workers on dealing with landlords, mortgage lenders and other creditors, including sample letters explaining severe lost income due to the lack of federal funding. 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
The FCC, which regulates radio and television broadcast and cable systems, said it will suspend most operations at midday on Thursday, if the shutdown has not ended by then. Work for “the protection of life and property” will continue. So will operations at the agency’s Office of Inspector General, the FCC’s internal watchdog. 
COAST GUARD 
Members of the Coast Guard were due to get their final 2018 paychecks on Monday, their last until the government reopens. 
FEMA 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to resume issuing new flood insurance policies during the shutdown, reversing an earlier decision. 
INTERIOR 
The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, is operating with a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, some parks may be accessible, with others closed completely. The National Park Service is providing no visitor services such as restrooms, facility and road maintenance and trash collection. 
TRANSPORTATION 
Of its 55,000 employees, 20,400 have been put on leave. This excludes most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 are working and the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources. 
Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits have been paused. 
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
An estimated 1,100 of the office’s 1,800 employees are on leave. This includes most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps implement budget and policy goals.

When asked by “Late Night” host Seth Meyers if President Trump’s claims that “cows farting” and “hamburgers” would be outlawed were true, Ocasio-Cortez firmly answered “No.” “I think it’s good to see how these narratives are manipulated,"" she said, ""because they’re trying to say that the Green New Deal is about what we have to give up, what we have to cut back on, when in fact the Green New Deal itself is resolution to be more expansive.”

Comey added that he doesn't think Congress should try to impeach Trump and that the president’s supporters could see impeachment as an attempted ""coup.""

"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) Fort Worth's nearly $1.2 billion Panther Island project is pitched as a flood control measure that would bring a vibrant riverfront neighborhood to the city, but critics are questioning whether it's disguised as a flood plan to tap into federal money.
The Army Corps of Engineers quietly excluded the project from its 2018 budget, which led to concerns about management of the project that would cut a channel in Trinity River and form an island.
Backers have said the project will pull thousands of acres of Fort Worth real estate out of a flood plain, while boosting the local economy with new commercial and residential space. But opponents are claiming that Panther Island ignores real flooding issues, the Fort Worth Star-Telegraph reported .
Fort Worth's 21 miles (34 kilometers) of levees along Trinity River can no longer protect the city from a major flooding event, said Woody Frossard, an engineer with the Tarrant Regional Water District.
But the Panther Island plan doesn't alleviate urban flash flooding that has increasingly plagued Fort Worth streets. Instead, it pulls about 2,400 acres (970 hectares) out of the flood plain for potentially the most severe flood possible for the region.
Engineers believe the project would protect several neighborhoods along the river. It would also make about 800 acres (320 hectares) ripe for development.
The changes from the project would lead Trinity River's water to flow more quickly downstream during a flood stage, toward cities such as Dallas. The plans call for overflow basins to be built to slow the flow of water, which opponents argue doesn't make sense.
""They're creating a flood situation to take a flood situation,"" said Clyde Picht, who voted in support of the project when he was on City Council. Picht and others have criticized the project's rising costs and lengthy timeline.
The project was estimated to cost less than $500 million in 2005, and its ballooned over $1 billion nearly 15 years later.
Voters passed a $250 million bond last year, which will pay for infrastructure on the island and some flood control. A special 40-year tax district was also established to help fund development.
Officials have said that the project may not be completed for another 15 years.
Lynn Lovell, a retired Fort Worth engineer, said the timeline is normal for major federal projects, which can be stalled by funding.
""Funding these projects is competitive nationwide,"" he said. ""It just depends on Congress' mood and how powerful the congressional delegation is.""

"Hundreds of people were snowed-in in Alpine regions and warned of a high risk of avalanches, parts of Scandinavia were left without electricity, and high winds caused flight delays and cancellations in the Netherlands as deadly winter weather continued to blast Europe on Tuesday.
Several people have already been killed in weather-related incidents over the last week, and in Norway attempts to find the bodies of four skiers were again put on hold due to poor visibility and heavy snowfall. A 29-year Swedish woman and three Finns, aged 29, 32 and 36, were presumed dead after a 300-meter-wide (990-foot-wide) avalanche hit the Tamok valley, near the northern city of Tromsoe, last week.
In Austria, hundreds of residents were stuck in their homes due to blocked roads, and some regions experienced power outages after snow-laden trees took down power lines.
Schools in some Austrian regions remained closed for a second day and homeowners were advised to remove snow from their roofs after several buildings collapsed. A 78-year-old man was severely injured when he fell of the roof of his home in Turrach while shoveling snow, Austrian public broadcaster ORF reported.
On Monday night, 11 German hikers had to be rescued by mountaineers from a cabin near Salzburg, after having been snowed in without electricity and little food since Friday. Several people were killed by avalanches in recent days and authorities warned continuing snowfall is increasing the already high risk of more avalanches.
In southern and eastern Germany, people were also bracing for further snowfall, while in the northern coastal city of Hamburg residents were preparing for a storm flood caused by a winter gale, the German news agency dpa reported.
In neighboring Netherlands, Amsterdam's busy Schiphol Airport warned of delays and cancellations. Dutch carrier KLM canceled 159 flights to and from European destinations.
In northwestern Dutch coastal regions expected to be hardest hit by strong winds and wild seas, local water authorities began checking dikes to make sure they were not damaged.
The Noorderzijlvest water authority said it was monitoring dikes because of debris floating in the sea after nearly 300 containers tumbled off a cargo ship in a storm last week. Many of the containers are still at sea and some have broken open, spilling their contents.
""A fridge or container that is rammed against a dike can cause damage,"" the authority said on its website.
Heavy snowfall and strong winds were reported Tuesday over central Scandinavia, hampering efforts to restore electricity after a hefty storm swept through northern Europe on Jan. 2.
Swedish media reported several fender-benders and stranded vehicles along roads but nothing unusual for the season in this part of Europe.
Meanwhile in southeastern Europe, schools in the Greek capital and many surrounding areas remained shut due to weather conditions after snowfall blanketed Athens, with temperatures in some parts of the country plunging well below freezing.
Courts in Athens were also to remain shut Tuesday, with only fast-track prosecutions being heard, the Justice Ministry said. Some rural roads, particularly those leading up to the mountains near the capital, were shut overnight and in the early morning.
Greece has been experiencing a cold snap for the past few days, with heavy snowfall, particularly in the north of the country and in mountainous areas. Temperatures have reached minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of northern Greece, while many islands have also experienced snowfall.

"(Reuters) - The Washington Redskins season took a precarious turn on Sunday when starting quarterback Alex Smith suffered a gruesome broken leg, an injury that reverberated around the National Football League. Smith’s season-ending broken right tibia and fibula in a 23-21 loss to the Houston Texans was a painful image that left the Redskins with much to digest. “When we get to that (play in the game film), we’ll speed past it watching it hurts yourself,” Redskins offensive lineman Chase Roullier told the Washington Post. “Horrible to see. Speed past that.” Washington coach Jay Gruden said Smith’s misfortune, which happened when he was sacked by J.J. Watt and Kareem Jackson in the third quarter, left his team with heavy hearts. “When you have an injury like that, it’s more heartbreaking than it is physical. Just breaks your heart. It’s just hard to watch that happen to any athlete.” Now the Redskins must start the challenging process of building without Smith, the signal-caller they traded for in the off-season and signed to a four-year extension. Backup QB Colt McCoy does not immediately evoke excitement, particularly as Washington (6-4) clings to a one-game lead atop the NFC East Division. The 32-year-old McCoy is just 7-18 as a career starter and could be leading an offense that already lacks punch. The Redskins are reeling from injuries, and are without All-Pro offensive lineman Trent Williams, starting wide receiver Jamison Crowder and running back Chris Thompson. Washington could pursue another quarterback replacement, but after their latest setback the team had little choice but to rally around McCoy. “I’m a big firm believer in Colt McCoy’s talent,” Gruden said. “This is the opportunity of a lifetime for him. I know he would like it in different circumstances.” The future circumstances for the 34-year-old Smith are now also dicey. Same day 33 years ago, Washington Hall of Fame QB Joe Theismann suffered a ghastly leg fracture that ended his career. A flood of players took to social media to send Smith well wishes. “Prayers for my guy man! You will bounce back!” Kansas City’s quarterback Patrick Mahomes tweeted.

""This is like a shocker to me,"" Jesus Leon, who lives in the area, told ABC News while looking at the hole, which runs at least 50 feet long by 20 feet wide, according to an estimate by experts on the ground.
""What I thought, it was at first an earthquake, but nothing in the house was shaking,"" Reina Menchaca, a nearby resident, told ABC affiliate KABC. ""So, we were wondering what it was and when I looked outside I saw the sinkhole.""
A sinkhole is seen in a condominium complex, Jan. 24, 2019, in La Habra, Calif. The hole is estimated to be about 80 feet long and 20 feet wide.
The ground collapsed Wednesday night, sucking parts of a courtyard deep into the earth. A sidewalk crumbled and several trees toppled over into surrounding apartments.
In the immediate aftermath, a handful of apartments were voluntarily evacuated.
""Ive never seen anything like it certainly in our community,"" La Habra Mayor James Gomez told ABC News.
As cadaver dogs searched for potential victims, local leaders diagnosed the problem. They believe a long concrete channel that transports water from the county flood control district collapsed.
Now, theyre trying to figure out if the county or the city is ultimately responsible and if recent rain was a contributing factor.
Authorities are now concerned that the rest of the courtyard could collapse but do not think that any residents or apartments will be further impacted.","A massive sinkhole opened at an apartment complex in Orange County, California.",2019-01-25T20:10:18Z,Massive sinkhole opens at apartment complex,ABC News,0
"The Latest on the first use of the nation's tallest dam in two years (all times local):
9:55 a.m.
California officials say they will start letting water out of the nation's tallest dam into the newly-rebuilt spillway Tuesday for the first time in two years.
The spillway crumbled in February 2017 as water was being released, prompting 200,000 downstream residents to flee their homes over fears of catastrophic flooding.
Molly White, principal engineer with the California Department of Water Resources, says crews will start releasing 8,300 cubic feet per second at 11 a.m. Tuesday. She says they may increase the water release to 20,000 cubic feet per second.
White says the water releases may be increased during the week as spring storms continue to feed the enormous reservoir behind Oroville Dam in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
12:00 a.m.
Water will rush down the main spillway at the nation's tallest dam for the first time since it crumbled in heavy rain two years ago and threatened to flood California communities.
The state Department of Water Resources anticipates releasing water down the spillway at Oroville Dam as early as Tuesday due to stormy weather.
The spring storms follow a very wet winter that coated the mountains with thick snowpack. State experts will coincidentally measure the snowpack Tuesday to determine the outlook for California's water supplies.
In early 2017, the dam's half-century-old spillway broke apart as it carried heavy flows from storms. That drove nearly 200,000 people from their homes over fears of catastrophic flooding.

"NORTH WATERBORO, Maine The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed. He logged onto his website and began to invent his first news story of the day. BREAKING, he wrote, pecking out each letter with his index fingers as he considered the possibilities. Maybe he would announce that Hillary Clinton had died during a secret overseas mission to smuggle more refugees into America. Maybe he would award President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize for his courage in denying climate change. A new message popped onto Blairs screen from a friend who helped with his website. What viral insanity should we spread this morning? the friend asked. The more extreme we become, the more people believe it, Blair replied. He had launched his new website on Facebook during the 2016 presidential campaign as a practical joke among friends a political satire site started by Blair and a few other liberal bloggers who wanted to make fun of what they considered to be extremist ideas spreading throughout the far right. In the last two years on his page, Americas Last Line of Defense, Blair had made up stories about California instituting sharia, former president Bill Clinton becoming a serial killer, undocumented immigrants defacing Mount Rushmore, and former president Barack Obama dodging the Vietnam draft when he was 9. Share if youre outraged! his posts often read, and thousands of people on Facebook had clicked like and then share, most of whom did not recognize his posts as satire. Instead, Blairs page had become one of the most popular on Facebook among Trump-supporting conservatives over 55. Nothing on this page is real, read one of the 14 disclaimers on Blairs site, and yet in the America of 2018 his stories had become real, reinforcing peoples biases, spreading onto Macedonian and Russian fake news sites, amassing an audience of as many 6 million visitors each month who thought his posts were factual. What Blair had first conceived of as an elaborate joke was beginning to reveal something darker. No matter how racist, how bigoted, how offensive, how obviously fake we get, people keep coming back, Blair once wrote, on his own personal Facebook page. Where is the edge? Is there ever a point where people realize theyre being fed garbage and decide to return to reality? Blairs own reality was out beyond the shuttered curtains of his office: a three-bedroom home in the forest of Maine where the paved road turned to gravel; not his house but a rental; not on the lake but near it. Over the past decade his family had moved around the country a half-dozen times as he looked for steady work, bouncing between construction and restaurant jobs while sometimes living on food stamps. During the economic crash of 2008, his wife had taken a job at Wendys to help pay down their credit-card debt, and Blair, a lifelong Democrat, had begun venting his political frustration online, arguing with strangers in an Internet forum called Brawl Hall. He sometimes masqueraded as a tea party conservative on Facebook so he could gain administrative access into their private groups and then flood their pages with liberal ideas before using his administrative status to shut their pages down. He had created more than a dozen online profiles over the last years, sometimes disguising himself in accompanying photographs as a beautiful Southern blond woman or as a bandana-wearing conservative named Flagg Eagleton, baiting people into making racist or sexist comments and then publicly eviscerating them for it. In his writing Blair was blunt, witty and prolific, and gradually hed built a liberal following on the Internet and earned a full-time job as a political blogger. On the screen, like nowhere else, he could say exactly how he felt and become whomever he wanted. Now he hunched over a desk wedged between an overturned treadmill and two turtle tanks, scanning through conservative forums on Facebook for something that might inspire his next post. He was 6-foot-6 and 325 pounds, and he typed several thousand words each day in all capital letters. He noticed a photo online of Trump standing at attention for the national anthem during a White House ceremony. Behind the president were several dozen dignitaries, including a white woman standing next to a black woman, and Blair copied the picture, circled the two women in red and wrote the first thing that came into his mind. President Trump extended an olive branch and invited Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton, Blair wrote. They thanked him by giving him the finger during the national anthem. Lock them up for treason! Blair finished typing and looked again at the picture. The white woman was not in fact Chelsea Clinton but former White House strategist Hope Hicks. The black woman was not Michelle Obama but former Trump aide Omarosa Newman. Neither Obama nor Clinton had been invited to the ceremony. Nobody had flipped off the president. The entire premise was utterly ridiculous, which was exactly Blairs point. We live in an Idiocracy, read a small note on Blairs desk, and he was taking full advantage. In a good month, the advertising revenue from his website earned him as much as $15,000, and it had also won him a loyal army of online fans. Hundreds of liberals now visited Americas Last Line of Defense to humiliate conservatives who shared Blairs fake stories as fact. In Blairs private Facebook messages with his liberal supporters, his conservative audience was made up of sheep, hillbillies, maw-maw and paw-paw, TrumpTards, potatoes and taters. How could any thinking person believe this nonsense? he said. He hit the publish button and watched as his lie began to spread. *** It was barely dawn in Pahrump, Nev., when Shirley Chapian, 76, logged onto Facebook for her morning computer game of Criminal Case. She believed in starting each day with a problem-solving challenge, a quick mental exercise to keep her brain sharp more than a decade into retirement. For a while it had been the daily crossword puzzle, but then the local newspaper stopped delivering and a friend introduced her to the viral Facebook game with 65 million players. She spent an hour as a 1930s detective, interrogating witnesses and trying to parse their lies from the truth until finally she solved case No. 48 and clicked over to her Facebook news feed. Good morning, Shirley! Thanks for being here, read an automated note at the top of her page. She put her finger on the mouse and began scrolling down. Click LIKE if you believe we must stop Sharia Law from coming to America before its too late, read the first item, and she clicked like. Share to help END the ongoing migrant invasion! read another, and she clicked share. The house was empty and quiet except for the clicking of her computer mouse. She lived alone, and on many days her only personal interaction occurred here, on Facebook. Mixed into her morning news feed were photos and updates from some of her 300 friends, but most items came directly from political groups Chapian had chosen to follow: Free Speech Patriots, Taking Back America, Ban Islam, Trump 2020 and Rebel Life. Each political page published several posts each day directly into Chapians feed, many of which claimed to be BREAKING NEWS. On her computer the attack against America was urgent and unrelenting. Liberals were restricting free speech. Immigrants were storming the border and casting illegal votes. Politicians were scheming to take away everyones guns. The second you stop paying attention, theres another travesty underway in this country, Chapian once wrote, in her own Facebook post, so she had decided to always pay attention, sometimes scrolling and sharing for hours at a time. BREAKING: Democrat mega-donor accused of sexual assault!!! Is Michelle Obama really dating Bruce Springsteen? Iowa Farmer Claims Bill Clinton had Sex with Cow during Cocaine Party. On display above Chapians screen were needlepoints that had once occupied much of her free time, intricate pieces of artwork that took hundreds of hours to complete, but now she didnt have the patience. Out her window was a dead-end road of identical beige-and-brown rock gardens surrounding double-wide trailers that looked similar to her own, many of them occupied by neighbors whom shed never met. Beyond that was nothing but cactuses and heat waves for as far as she could see a stretch of unincorporated land that continued from her backyard into the desert. Shed spent almost a decade in Pahrump without really knowing why. The heat could be unbearable. She had no family in Nevada. She loved going to movies, and the town of 30,000 didnt have a theater. It seemed to her like a place in the business of luring people into the air-conditioned casinos downtown, into the legal brothels on the edge of the desert, into the new developments of cheap housing available for no money down and in some ways shed become stuck, too. She had lived much of her life in cities throughout Europe and across the United States places such as San Francisco, New York and Miami. Shed gone to college for a few years and become an insurance adjuster, working as one of the few women in the field in the 1980s and 90s and joining the National Organization for Women to advocate for an equal wage before eventually moving to Rhode Island to work for a hospice and care for her aging parents. After her mother died, Chapian decided to retire and move to Las Vegas to live with a friend, and when Las Vegas become too expensive a real estate agent told her about Pahrump. She bought a three-bedroom trailer for less than $100,000 and painted it purple. She met a few friends at the local senior center and started eating at the Thai restaurant in town. A few years after arriving, she bought a new computer monitor and signed up for Facebook in 2009, choosing as her profile image a photo of her cat. Looking to connect with friends and other like-minded people, she wrote then. She had usually voted for Republicans, just like her parents, but it was only on Facebook that Chapian had become a committed conservative. She was wary of Obama in the months after his election, believing him to be both arrogant and inexperienced, and on Facebook she sought out a litany of information that seemed to confirm her worst fears, unaware that some of that information was false. It wasnt just that Obama was liberal, she read; he was actually a socialist. It wasnt just that his political qualifications were thin; it was that he had fabricated those qualifications, including parts of his college transcripts and maybe even his birth certificate. For years she had watched network TV news, but increasingly Chapian wondered about the widening gap between what she read online and what she heard on the networks. What else arent they telling us? she wrote once, on Facebook, and if she believed the mainstream media was becoming insufficient or biased, it was her responsibility to seek out alternatives. She signed up for a dozen conservative newsletters and began to watch Alex Jones on Infowars. One far right Facebook group eventually led her to the next with targeted advertising, and soon Chapian was following more than 2,500 conservative pages, an ideological echo chamber that often trafficked in skepticism. Climate change was a hoax. The mainstream media was censored or scripted. Political Washington was under control of a deep state. Chapian didnt believe everything she read online, but she was also distrustful of mainstream fact-checkers and reported news. It sometimes felt to her like real facts had become indiscernible that the truth was often somewhere in between. What she trusted most was her own ability to think critically and discern the truth, and increasingly her instincts aligned with the online community where she spent most of her time. It had been months since shed gone to a movie. It had been almost a year since shed made the hour-long trip to Las Vegas. Her number of likes and shares on Facebook increased each year until she was sometimes awakening to check her news feed in the middle of the night, liking and commenting on dozens of posts each day. She felt as if she was being let in on a series of dark revelations about the United States, and it was her responsibility to see and to share them. Im not a conspiracy-theory-type person, but... she wrote, before sharing a link to an unsourced story suggesting that Democratic donor George Soros had been a committed Nazi, or that a Parkland shooting survivor was actually a paid actor. Now another post arrived in her news feed, from a page called Americas Last Line of Defense, which Chapian had been following for more than a year. It showed a picture of Trump standing at a White House ceremony. Circled in the background were two women, one black and one white. President Trump extended an olive branch and invited Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton, the post read. They thanked him by giving him the finger during the national anthem. Chapian looked at the photo and nothing about it surprised her. Of course Trump had invited Clinton and Obama to the White House in a generous act of patriotism. Of course the Democrats or Demonrats, as Chapian sometimes called them had acted badly and disrespected America. It was the exact same narrative she saw playing out on her screen hundreds of times each day, and this time she decided to click like and leave a comment. Well, they never did have any class, she wrote. *** Blair had invented thousands of stories in the past two years, always trafficking in the same stereotypes to fool the same people, but he never tired of watching a post take off: Eight shares in the first minute, 160 within 15 minutes, more than 1,000 by the end of the hour. Aaaaand, were viral, he wrote, in a message to his liberal supporters on his private Facebook page. Its getting to the point where I can no longer control the absolute absurdity of the things I post. No matter how ridiculous, how obviously fake, or how many times you tell the same taters... they will still click that like and hit that share button. By the standards of Americas Last Line of Defense, the item about Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton was only a moderate success. It included no advertisements, so it wouldnt earn Blair any money. It wasnt even the most popular of the 11 items hed published that day. But, just an hour earlier, Blair had come up with an idea at his computer in Maine, and now hundreds or maybe thousands of people across the country believed Obama and Clinton had flipped off the president. Gross. Those women have no respect for themselves, wrote a woman in Fort Washakie, Wyo. They deserve to be publicly shunned, said a man in Gainesville, Fla. Not surprising behavior from such ill bred trash. Jail them now!!! Blair had fooled them. Now came his favorite part, the gotcha, when he could let his victims in on the joke. OK, taters. Heres your reality check, he wrote on Americas Last Line of Defense, placing his comment prominently alongside the original post. That is Omarosa and Hope Hicks, not Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton. They wouldnt be caught dead posing for this pseudo-patriotic nationalistic garbage... Congratulations, stupid. Beyond the money he earned, this was what Blair had conceived of as the purpose for his website: to engage directly with people who spread false or extremist stories and prove those stories were wrong. Maybe, after people had been publicly embarrassed, they would think more critically about what they shared online. Maybe they would begin to question the root of some of their ideas. Blair didnt have time to personally confront each of the several hundred thousand conservatives who followed his Facebook page, so hed built a community of more than 100 liberals to police the page with him. Together they patrolled the comments, venting their own political anger, shaming conservatives who had been fooled, taunting them, baiting them into making racist comments that could then be reported to Facebook. Blair said he and his followers had gotten hundreds of people banned from Facebook and several others fired or demoted in their jobs for offensive behavior online. He had also forced Facebook to shut down 22 fake news sites for plagiarizing his content, many of which were Macedonian sites that reran his stories without labeling them as satire. What Blair wasnt sure he had ever done was change a single persons mind. The people he fooled often came back to the page, and he continued to feed them the kind of viral content that boosted his readership and his bank account: invented stories about Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players, imams, Black Lives Matter protesters, immigrants, George Soros, the Clinton Foundation, Michelle and Malia Obama. He had begun to include more obvious disclaimers at the top of every post and to intentionally misspell several words in order to highlight the idiocy of his work, but still traffic continued to climb. Sometimes he wondered: Rather than of awakening people to reality, was he pushing them further from it? Well, they never did have any class, commented Shirley Chapian, from Pahrump, Nev., and Blair watched his liberal followers respond. Thats kind of an ironic comment coming from pure trailer trash, dont you think? Youre a gullible moron who just fell for a fake story on a Liberal satire page. You my dear... are as smart as a potato. *** What a waste of flesh and time. Welcome to the internet. Critical thinking required. Chapian saw the comments after her post and wondered as she often did when she was attacked: Who were these people? And what were they talking about? Of course Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton had flipped off the president. It was true to what she knew of their character. That was what mattered. Instead of responding directly to strangers on Americas Last Line of Defense, Chapian wrote on her own Facebook page. Nasty liberals, she said, and then she went back to her news feed, each day blending into the next. A Muslim woman with her burqa on fire: like. A policeman using a baton to beat a masked antifa protester: like. Hillary Clinton looking gaunt and pale: like. A military helicopter armed with machine guns and headed toward the caravan of immigrants: like. She had spent a few hours scrolling one afternoon when she heard a noise outside her window, and she turned away from the screen to look outside. A neighbor was sweeping his sidewalk, pushing tiny white rocks back into his rock garden. The sky was an uninterrupted blue. A mailman worked his way up the empty street. There were no signs of Sharia Law. The migrant caravan was still hundreds of miles away in Mexico. Antifa protesters had yet to descend on Pahrump. Chapian squinted against the sun, closed the shades and went back to her screen. A picture of undocumented immigrants laughing inside a voting booth: like. Deep State Alive and Well: like. She scrolled upon another post from Americas Last Line of Defense, reading fast, oblivious to the satire labels and not noticing Blairs trademark awkward phrasings and misspellings. It showed a group of children kneeling on prayer mats in a classroom. California School children forced to Sharia in Class, it read. All of them have stopped eating bacon. Two began speaking in Allah. Stop making children pray to imaginary Gods!! Chapian recoiled from the screen. Please! she said. If I had a kid in a school system like that, Id yank them out so fast. She had seen hundreds of stories on Facebook about the threat of sharia, and this confirmed much of what she already believed. It was probably true, she thought. It was true enough. Do people understand that things like this are happening in this country? she said. She clicked the post and the traffic registered back to a computer in Maine, where Blair watched another story go viral and wondered when his audience would get his joke.","'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America...

"As the Trump administration rolls back environmental and safety rules for the energy sector, government projections show billions of dollars in savings reaped by companies will come at a steep cost: more premature deaths and illnesses from air pollution, a jump in climate-warming emissions and more severe derailments of trains carrying explosive fuels.
The Associated Press analyzed 11 major rules targeted for repeal or relaxation under Trump, using the administration's own estimates to tally how its actions would boost businesses and harm society.
The AP identified up to $11.6 billion in potential future savings for companies that extract, burn and transport fossil fuels. Industry windfalls of billions of dollars more could come from a freeze in vehicle efficiency standards that will yield an estimated 79 billion-gallon (300 million-liter) increase in fuel consumption.
On the opposite side of the government's ledger, buried in thousands of pages of analyses, are the ""social costs"" of rolling back the regulations. Among them:
— Up to 1,400 additional premature deaths annually due to the pending repeal of a rule to cut coal plant pollution.
— An increase in greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 billion tons (907 million metric tons) from vehicles produced over the next decade — a figure equivalent to annual emissions of almost 200 million vehicles.
— Increased risk of water contamination from a drilling technique known as ""fracking.""
— Fewer safety checks to prevent offshore oil spills.
For the Trump administration and its supporters, the rule changes examined by AP mark a much-needed pivot away from heavy regulations that threatened to hold back the Republican president's goal of increasing U.S. energy production. But the AP's findings also underscore the administration's willingness to put company profits ahead of safety considerations and pollution effects.
Siding with industry 
The AP found the administration has sought to bolster the changes by emphasizing, and sometimes exaggerating, economic gains while minimizing negative impacts.
For example, when calculating future damages from greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants, the Trump administration looked only at U.S. effects, instead of globally. That drastically reduced the benefits of emission restrictions and allowed the administration to conclude the Obama-era rule was no longer justified, given costs to the coal industry.
In another instance, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to stop considering secondary benefits of controlling mercury emissions — namely reductions in other pollutants projected to prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths.
Last month, the AP revealed that the administration understated the advantages of installing better brakes on trains carrying crude oil and ethanol. Transportation Department officials acknowledged they miscalculated potential benefits by up to $117 million because they failed to include some projected future derailments.
In explaining its actions, the Trump administration said in some cases that the previous administration understated the price tag on new industry restrictions. In others, it said President Barack Obama's administration had been overly expansive in how it defined benefits to society.
Michael Greenstone, a University of Chicago professor who served as chief economist for Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said the Trump administration was downplaying the health and environmental impacts of its actions.
""When you start fudging the numbers, it's not that the costs just evaporate into thin air. We will pay,"" Greenstone said. ""They are reducing the costs for industries where pollution is a byproduct.""
The rules being targeted were largely crafted under Obama in response to climate change, the disastrous 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, massive releases from coal ash dumps and fuel train explosions.
Administration: negligible risks
Trump's administration has stressed that savings for companies were greater than any increased perils to safety or the environment.
""We fully recognize every significant policy decision has a consequence and that those consequences can differ,"" acting U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told the AP. ""I think when you look at the track record, holistically, what you see is our deregulatory efforts are still pretty protective.""
The AP's tally of savings was derived from government projections required under a 1993 executive order. Five of the rule changes are still pending.
On rules for toxic coal ash, offshore safety and refinery pollution, the administration said companies would save hundreds of millions of dollars with little or no added risk — an assertion former federal officials and environmental groups have disputed.
The potential industry savings were projected largely over the next decade.
Sectors of the coal industry see lifting costly rules as a matter of survival because demand has plummeted as utilities switch to cleaner-burning fuels.
For the oil and gas industry, with hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue, the economic impact of the Obama-era rules was comparatively small. But they were vigorously opposed as restrictions on business.
""We need to make sure we're putting together rules that are flexible enough to apply the latest, greatest technologies,"" said Erik Milito, vice president for the American Petroleum institute. He said the group focused on whether rules make sense, rather than cost savings.
Critics say the impact on public health and the environment will be even worse than projected.
""I don't think it's well understood what the death toll of these policies will be for the American people,"" said Paul Billings, of the American Lung Association.
Obama climate agenda assailed
Two sweeping changes under Trump — the rollback of the Clean Power Plan that threatened to close many coal power plants and a reversal of plans to increase vehicle fuel efficiency standards — were centerpieces of Obama's climate change actions.
Killing the power plan would save companies up to $6.4 billion, the EPA concluded.
The trade-off is almost 61 million tons (55 million metric tons) annually of additional carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The administration calculated that those emissions carry a maximum of $3.2 billion in ""social costs,"" such as flood damage and higher air conditioning costs.
Since company savings outweighed pollution costs, the administration said scrapping the power plan was justified. That conclusion was possible largely because the EPA limited social costs to effects in the U.S., instead of globally as under Obama.
EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said the analysis complied with a 2003 directive under President George W. Bush that said such reviews should focus on costs and benefits to people in the U.S.
Joe Goffman, a former EPA official who helped create the clean power plan and now at Harvard Law School, said the omission of international impacts ""doesn't track with reality"" given that climate change is a worldwide problem.
The Trump administration also limited pollution cost considerations in its proposal last month on mercury emitted by coal plants.
When the mercury rule was finalized in 2012, the EPA projected up to $90 billion in benefits, including avoidance of up to 11,000 premature deaths from other power plant pollutants.
Now, the EPA says those benefits could not be considered because they are not directly tied to mercury reductions. The only benefits that should be counted, the agency said, were improvements to IQ scores as a result of less mercury exposure, valued at up to $6 million annually.
The National Mining Association had urged the change. Spokesman Conor Bernstein said Obama's EPA misused the concept of secondary pollution benefits to justify its actions.
The rollback's impact is unclear since utilities already have spent an estimated $18 billion on new pollution controls.
Fuel standards and drilling safety
Some experts outside government take issue with the rationale for relaxing the fuel economy rule.
The Trump administration says reducing standards would save as many as 1,000 lives annually and spare consumers and car companies hundreds of billions of dollars on vehicles with higher gas mileage. To reach that conclusion, officials lowered estimates of how many vehicles people would buy.
But economists including from the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research say that assumption was fundamentally flawed, since looser standards would make cars cheaper and therefore increase demand. The economists said the government used misleading findings to wipe out at least $112 billion in potential societal benefits while falsely claiming its change would save numerous lives.
""Every change they made was made in the direction to make the standards look more expensive and the rollback to look cheaper and better,"" said Jeff Alson, who worked 40 years at an EPA lab in Michigan.
Several rules reworked under Trump tie directly to worker and public safety.
The administration rescinded requirements for improved fuel train brakes after determining the costs to industry would be higher than previously calculated. It acknowledged more spills from derailments would likely occur.
After AP's story about the agency's $117 million benefits understatement, spokesman Bobby Fraser said the decision to rescind the Obama rule would stand because the costs were still greater.
Two safety rules for offshore oil and gas drilling were adopted following the Deepwater Horizon accident, which killed 11 people and spilled 134 million gallons (507 million liters) of oil.
The Interior Department now says less rigid inspection and equipment requirements would save drilling companies hundreds of millions of dollars with ""negligible"" safety and environmental risks.
Lynn Scarlett, acting Interior Secretary under George W. Bush, said the changes ignore a government commission's findings on the Gulf spill.
""You're removing a tool that was developed intentionally to help reduce the risks,"" Scarlett said. ""The failure to have those protections raises the risk, such that actions can result in accidents like Deepwater Horizon.""",The administration's environmental rule changes could cause more premature deaths and climate-warming emissions,2019-01-28T14:21:31Z,Trump's rollbacks of fossil fuel regulations may carry steep costs,CBS News,0
"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) The Latest on the National Flood Insurance Program (all times local):
7:20 p.m.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has reversed course and will go back to issuing and renewing National Flood Insurance Program policies, despite the ongoing government shutdown.
FEMA announced the change of policy in a statement Friday, much to the relief of Louisiana homeowners and politicians.
In a statement, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy said FEMA had erred when it told insurers earlier this week that it said it cannot issue or renew NFIP policies during a partial government shutdown.
The decision had caused numerous home sales to be delayed because buyers weren't able to obtain flood coverage.
Cassidy says he is ""glad they are correcting it so home sales in limbo can proceed.""
Gov. John Bel Edwards tweeted that FEMA's new decision was ""welcome news.""
2:40 p.m.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency told insurers it cannot issue or renew National Flood Insurance Program policies during a partial government shutdown, upsetting members of the Louisiana delegation who were key in getting NFIP coverage extended into 2019.
News outlets report the agency informed insurers Wednesday. FEMA says it will continue to pay NFIP claims through the shutdown. It says it halted flood insurance funding because commission payments to private companies that issue the policies could be seen as an ""impermissible funding obligation"" during the shutdown.
More than 500,000 Louisiana homeowners currently depend on NFIP flood protection. Roughly 40,000 of those policies are up for renewal each month. That means homeowners whose policies expire during the shutdown won't be able to renew through the NFIP and the policies will become void after a 30-day grace period.

"(CNN) Once again, Donald Trump is betting he knows best about how to win an election, in a new swipe at conventional political wisdom that will make for an especially tense and unpredictable night once midterm results start rolling in. The President charged into Election Day Tuesday flinging vitriol and fear, false claims and politically incorrect rhetoric, defying warnings by GOP aides that his divisive style could cost Republicans the House of Representatives and that he should be focusing exclusively on the hot economy. Two years into Trump's tempestuous presidency, Democrats are targeting their best election results in six years. But given uncertainty over the quality of polling, questions over the makeup of the electorate and Trump's talent for busting political norms, no one can say for how the election will play out. Handicapping the races for all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate is especially difficult because Trump has chosen an inflammatory campaign strategy that even some top GOP officials fear could backfire. After ditching a message about the roaring economy in favor of a searing race-fueled attack on Democrats over immigration, Trump is trusting his own feel for what voters want to hear is still more acute than the advice of Republican strategists. If Tuesday is a bad night for Republicans, his high-stakes bet is sure to be second-guessed, but Trump is choosing to believe he's got it right again. After all, trusting his instincts and ignoring GOP elites and pundits is what landed him in the White House in the first place. ""There's a great electricity in the air, like we haven't seen, in my opinion, since the '16 election. So, something is happening,"" Trump told reporters on Monday, shrugging off suggestions that Democrats had the momentum. On the final day of an eight-state, 11-rally, six-day final campaign blitz, Trump rejected polling and historical precedent that suggests his low approval rating -- at 39% in the latest CNN poll -- could mean heavy losses for the GOP. At his final campaign stop at an exuberant rally in Missouri, Trump complained about media critiques of his tactics. ""If we don't do so well tomorrow, they will put me on the ticket. If we do great tomorrow, they will say he had nothing to do with it, he was not on the ticket,"" Trump said. Capping the most incendiary campaign by any President in modern memory, Trump has been conjuring a dark vision of crime and disorder that he said would unfold if Democrats won the House. On Monday, he warned of ""Democratic mobs"" and spoke of looming ""socialist nightmare."" He appeared alongside Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio at his final rally in Missouri. He also falsely accused Democrats of trying to get the vote for undocumented immigrants. None of that was an accident. Sources told CNN that the President ""hated"" a feel-good advertisement hailing the booming economy made by his re-election campaign and insisted instead on a hardline immigration message that including a racist web video in the belief that the issue puts Democrats on the defensive. ""They want America to be a giant sanctuary city for drug dealers, predators and blood thirsty MS-13 killers,"" Trump said at his first rally of the day in Ohio, invoking the migrant caravan of asylum seekers that he has portrayed as an imminent invasion even though it remains hundreds of miles away in Mexico. Tuesday's election, billed by both sides as the most important midterm in years, will be the most serious test yet of the way that Trump has conducted his tumultuous presidency and his refusal to tone down his behavior to widen his support base beyond the core of loyal voters who embraced his populist nationalism in 2016. The President's brazen style could help the Republicans hang on to the Senate, since many incumbent Democrats are up for re-election in red states where he won big. But GOP strategists are worried that the President's pyrotechnics that are designed to drive up enthusiasm and turnout among his most loyal fans will backfire in the suburban districts that hold the fate of the House. White House officials have warned Trump to expect losses in the House, multiple sources told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. And the President's decision to anchor the campaign on inflammatory rhetoric about immigration rather than one highlighting the roaring economy has angered some GOP strategists. ""I think many of us would rather win without dehumanizing and fear-mongering,"" a senior Republican Senate aide told CNN's Jim Acosta. Another GOP congressional aide warned that Trump's immigration message could fall flat in areas like suburban Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida and California. But there was one small sign that the President understands that his conduct could hurt him among some voters. ""I would like to have a much softer tone. I feel to a certain extent I have no choice, but maybe I do,"" Trump said in an interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group when asked if he had any regrets about his presidency. Democratic approach to midterms Democrats, who have largely avoided engaging Trump directly, preferring to concentrate on issues like health care are increasingly confident that they will take back the House and so bust the Republican monopoly in power in Washington. A CNN/SSRS poll released Monday showed Democrats with a gaping 55% to 42% lead over Republicans among likely voters in a generic congressional ballot. Trump was badly underwater among women voters -- who favor Democrats 62% to 35% -- a gender gap, that if borne out by real votes, could prove devastating to Republican hopes. In the latest forecast by CNN's Harry Enten, Democrats are tipped to win 226 seats and the House majority while Republicans will win just 209 seats. Republicans are expected to hold 52 Senate seats and to retain their majority. But all forecasts and predictions are clouded by doubt given the unique characteristics of this election and the lessons learned after Trump's shock victory over Hillary Clinton two years ago. Trump is such an idiosyncratic politician, and has shattered norms so often, that no one is yet ready to conclude he will fall prey to the traditional losses handed out to a new president in their first midterm election. Then there is the question of whether voters are hiding their true inclinations from pollsters, as seemed to be part of the case in 2016 when Trump outperformed polls. ""I'm a religious man but I am not a prophet,"" Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" on Monday when asked what would happen on Tuesday. ""I don't think anyone knows, so many of these races are within the margin of error."" Democrats, even while expecting their best night since President Barack Obama was re-elected six years ago, are not counting any chickens, given their raw memories of 2016. ""I was here, near tears in 2016, and so, no, we don't trust polls at all,"" said Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and former Democratic state lawmaker in South Carolina on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" A Democratic House for the first time in eight years would be disastrous for Trump as it would guarantee a flood of investigations and subpoenas heading to the White House from committee chairman targeting his administration and personal business affairs. In essence, the midterm election will decide whether voters, after a tumultuous two years want to rein in Trump's power, or effectively want to give him more control by preserving the GOP monopoly on power in Washington. CNN's Jim Acosta, Pamela Brown, Jeff Zeleny, Kaitlan Collins and Sarah Westwood contributed to this report.","Once again, Donald Trump is betting he knows best about how to win an election, in a new swipe at conventional political wisdom that will make for an especially tense and unpredictable night once midterm results start rolling in.",2018-11-06T06:00:05Z,"Trump aims to upend convention again after midterm campaign of fear, lies and defiance",CNN,0
"In a story Jan. 11 about the government shutdown, The Associated Press from an article that originally appeared on the personal finance web site NerdWallet reported erroneously that mortgage loans guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs would be affected by the shutdown. The VA says that operations are not affected by the shutdown.
A corrected version of the story is below:
What the government shutdown means for your mortgage
See how the government shutdown is directly impacting homeowners and homebuyers alike and what you can do
By HOLDEN LEWIS
NerdWallet
The partial federal government shutdown is complicating the already complicated process of getting and managing a mortgage. For one thing, the political storm is like severe weather at a major airport: You can expect minor delays or worse. And if you're among the 800,000 federal employees going without a regular paycheck, it could mean trouble making a house payment.
Here's how the shutdown is affecting homebuyers and homeowners and what you can do about it.
IF YOU'RE GETTING AN FHA, VA OR USDA LOAN
If you're getting a Federal Housing Administration loan, it's likely you can expect delays in the underwriting process, and it's possible your closing date will be pushed back as well.
Single-family FHA loans are being funded, even during the shutdown. FHA home equity conversion mortgages (known as reverse mortgages) and FHA Title I loans (financing for permanent property improvements and renovations) are the exception and won't be processed during the shutdown.
FHA spokespeople weren't available to provide an estimate of how many borrowers could have their loans delayed. But the most-recent data suggest delays could potentially affect thousands of borrowers.
In January 2018, the FHA insured mortgages for 64,401 single-family homebuyers of those, 82 percent were first-time buyers.
The processing of VA loans, which are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, will continue, according to the VA.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture isn't approving new USDA loans during the shutdown. According to USDA data, the department guaranteed or made about 10,000 single-family loans each month in the most recent fiscal year that ended in September.
IF YOU'RE SEEKING A CONVENTIONAL LOAN
Most mortgages are considered conventional loans, meaning they aren't backed by the federal government. However, they are facilitated by government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
As private companies, Fannie and Freddie aren't directly affected by the shutdown. Mortgage processing is continuing as usual, except in cases where the federal government provides information required for underwriting.
""The IRS has not been processing 4506-T tax transcripts tax return verifications which are required on most files, although that service is restarting,"" Rood says. ""There will still be a backlog due to requests that have been piling up since Dec. 22.""
Self-employed borrowers are particularly affected by the lack of access to federal income tax transcripts. Some lenders may accept signed tax returns in lieu of transcripts.
And the shutdown could also stall verification of employment for government employees.
IF YOU NEED FLOOD INSURANCE
Getting flood insurance if you're buying in a flood-prone area shouldn't be a problem despite some earlier troubled waters.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced on Dec. 28 that it would resume selling and renewing flood insurance policies. That reversed a Dec. 26 decision to suspend policy sales and renewals during the partial shutdown.
""This new decision means thousands of home sale transactions in communities across the country can go forward without interruption,"" National Association of Realtors President John Smaby said in a press release.
IF YOU OWN A HOME BUT AREN'T GETTING PAID
If the lack of a paycheck has you worried about paying an existing mortgage on time, contact your loan servicer immediately. Explain your situation and ask about alternatives.
One common option is forbearance, an arrangement designed to help homeowners during periods of financial hardship. Forbearance temporarily reduces or suspends your mortgage payments while money is short. For example, Wells Fargo and LoanDepot list forbearance on their websites, though cases are approved on an individual basis.
A short-term loan that makes up for missed pay is another possible option. Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering one-time zero percent APR loans of up to $6,000 for federal employees and active-duty members of the Coast Guard who typically use direct deposit for their paychecks.
Talking with your lender before you miss a payment could keep your credit score from suffering a hit.
""We will work with each customer individually and can help with things such as late fees and not reporting to the credit bureau,"" Tom Kelly, a JPMorgan Chase spokesman, said in an email.
IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING A MORTGAGE RATE LOCK
Mortgage rates already had been falling when the shutdown began Dec. 22, and they fell more than an eighth of a percentage point in the two weeks that followed. That's why the shutdown could give you a chance to grab a good mortgage rate.
""Our expectation is that this will be a short-term blip and you'll be glad if you were able to take advantage of the drop in mortgage rates,"" says Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. Her forecast assumes that the shutdown won't last for months and that mortgage rates will rise this year.
'LENDERS ARE CLOSING THOUSANDS OF LOANS A DAY'
Shutdown-related issues are causing delays of up to two weeks on typical loans, according to Alan Rosenbaum, CEO and founder of Guardhill Financial in New York City. Still, one industry leader thinks it's mostly business as usual.
""The government shutdown is having a minimal impact on the mortgage industry,"" Mat Ishbia, president and CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, says. ""Lenders are closing thousands of loans a day. Everything is moving forward.""
As well, a Jan. 7 survey of 2,211 members by the National Association of Realtors found that 75 percent of respondents said the shutdown hasn't had an impact on contract signings or closings.
Of those Realtors who said the shutdown had affected transactions, a quarter said a buyer decided not to buy because of general economic uncertainty; 17 percent had clients whose closings were delayed because they were getting USDA loans; 13 percent said a client's closing was delayed because of IRS income verification issues; 9 percent reported delays with FHA loans; and 6 percent with VA loans.
And 9 percent said they had a client who was a federal employee who decided not to buy because of lost income or furlough.

"Stephen J. Pyne is a professor in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University and the author of ""Between Two Fires: A Fire History of Contemporary America"" and ""To the Last Smoke,"" a series of regional fire surveys. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) In October 1918, a swarm of smoldering fires flared and rode rising winds through 1,500 square miles outside Duluth, Minnesota. The flames incinerated cities, killed at least 450 people, and overtook evacuees as they fled in cars. It wasn't the last fire of a cycle that began in 1825 in Maine and migrated through the Lake States before moving on, but it was the last in which the fallen numbered in the hundreds. Then, over several decades, the scene calmed. That former era of firestorms was sparked along the frontier. Settlers and logging companies felled the forests and left lands lathered in slash. They used fires widely to work the land into agriculture. They built houses and towns out of wood, and they lacked much incentive to prevent burning, or the capacity to fight the fires that blew up. Railroads cast sparks with abandon. Year after year, decade after decade, the sorrowful scenario repeated. But after the 1918 eruption, the rising tide ebbed. This did not occur spontaneously. Cities gradually adopted fire and building codes and enforced them. They zoned in ways to halt fire spread and ensure egress. They installed a fire protection infrastructure. Individual buildings and a town block burned here and there, but fires in cities no longer spread like fires in forests. The countryside also changed. Settlement ceased, and logging and its slash heaps were more or less domesticated. The wild and the settled were untangled into separate realms, routine burning on the landscape yielded to internal combustion, and firefighting agencies matured. By the mid-20th century the horrific fires had faded, replaced with occasional outbreaks more akin to seasonal flu than an epidemic on the order of the Spanish flu (which, incidentally, had begun earlier in 1918). Now the flames are back. Why? Because the conditions that spawned the era of frontier fires have found modern surrogates. A new wave of settlement is recolonizing our formerly rural lands, this time converting to towns or exurbs, often out of materials similar to that of their surroundings. Building codes and zoning are often feeble, or have come decades after indifferent attention. Fire protection has strengthened, but it also eliminated, as a consequence, the ""good,"" smaller blazes that had formerly pruned back fuels that might otherwise feed a conflagration. The countryside matured, sometimes in unhelpful ways because of the success of fire exclusion campaigns. Geographies that had been painfully segregated remixed as suburbs and pushed against wildlands, while urban enclaves and exurbs found themselves amid revanchist woods. Climate change lengthened fire seasons and worsened some of the conditions that allowed vegetation to convert into fuel. It assumed the role of performance enhancer that slash had earlier previously served. The fires mutated from occasional nuisances into menaces. The problem manifested itself most dramatically in postwar California and was dismissed as a California quirk. Then it infected much of the American West with flames rushing around Spokane, Reno, the Wasatch Front, and -- with particular venom -- Colorado's Front Range. Then they moved into the Great Plains, then outside Austin, Texas, the coastal plains, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. At first, the prevailing narrative was one of dumb Californians (or westerners) putting houses where there were bound to be fires. Increasingly, thanks to climate change and land use, the narrative is becoming one of fires going to where the houses are. What can we do to turn the tide again? We can relearn the lessons of that last-century plague. Most basically, we need to define the problem correctly. The ""wildland-urban interface"" is a dumb, geeky name coined in California in the early 1970s. It viewed the problem of wildfires from the perspective of wildlands. By then the wildland fire community -- that is, the federal agencies (such as the National Park Service and Forest Service) and some state and private institutions that were concerned with fire on landscapes -- had admitted the self-destructive folly of trying to exclude all fire from all lands and had committed to restoring ""good"" fire. It defined the problem as one of encroaching houses and the loss of a rural buffer zone. It knew it could not eliminate all fires, and couldn't afford to, since in most landscapes fire was both inevitable and necessary. But it saw those fires getting more savage and knew that new houses compromised attempts to contain fires as a wildland issue. But we might equally view the problem from the other side of the interface, that is, from cities and sprawling towns. Suburbs and exurbs are fringes and fragments of cities with peculiar landscaping. They are amenable to the methods that tamed America's urban blazes in that earlier era: fire codes, life safety codes, building codes, zoning, an infrastructure for urban fire protection. Such a redefinition makes sense because plenty of research, not only in the US but in Australia and elsewhere, points to ember swarms as the primary ignition source in threatened communities. Blizzards of sparks from an advancing fire act on the structure itself and on the flammable material -- shrubs, mulch and pine needles --immediately around it. This ""home ignition zone,""as it's called, holds the critical points of vulnerability. It's where fire enters the built environment. Similarly, we know that fires occur in patterns -- as do winds, such as those blasting California -- and like flood plains, they map zones of high risk. They help identify what communities need the most urgent attention. (Malibu has burned so often, for example, it might make sense to highlight decades without a ""disaster"" fire.) Yes, the countryside needs treatment as well. We can dampen the ferocity of the flames -- the size of fires will depend mostly on the winds, but their intensity will depend on the fuel characteristics of the landscape. The home ignition zone has a counterpart around whole communities -- a ""community ignition zone."" There are lots of techniques for treating such areas, for fashioning the fire equivalent of greenbelts around communities and municipal watersheds. We can also begin to substitute prescribed, semi-tame flames for the feral fires that now result from accidents, lightning, and power lines, which function today as railroads did a century ago. But we need to choose solutions that make sense in terms of how fire behaves and kindles structures. Felling the woods will worsen the scene, unless you clean up afterwards. This can be expensive and brings its own hazards from burning the slash, which can lead to other fires and noxious smoke. We can't stop winds and abolish vegetation and eliminate fires. We can make communities sufficiently resilient to accept those outbursts without burning to stone and killing residents. We can go beyond thoughts and prayers, and the misbegotten sense that mass burnings must echo mass shootings in their random destruction and our helplessness to stop them. A century ago the horror of the 1918 outbreak marked a tipping point. The flames were tamed. And they can be tamed again. Let's hope this fire bust, piling on top of those in August and last fall, announces the ebb.","We can't stop winds and abolish vegetation and eliminate fires, Stephen Pyne writes, but ""we can make communities sufficiently resilient to accept those outbursts without burning to stone and killing residents.""",2018-11-21T22:28:23Z,We contained the horrors of wildfires before.

"(CNN)A tsunami which struck southern China around a thousand years ago nearly wiped out civilization in what is now one of the most densely populated regions of the planet, according to a new study by Chinese scientists. 
The devastation caused by the giant wave raises new questions over the potential vulnerability of the region today, particularly in the wake of last month's Indonesian tsunami and the ongoing expansion of nuclear power plants in southern China. 
Writing in the journal Chinese Science Bulletin this month, researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and East China Normal University said archaeological and sedimentary evidence, backed up by brief mentions in the historical record, pointed to a massive wave hitting what is now Guangdong province around 1076 AD, during the Song Dynasty. 
The effects of the tsunami appear to have been devastating, resulting in a ""drastic cultural decline"" which did not rebound until some five hundred years later.
The research team, led by Sun Liguang and Xie Zhouqing from USTC, first became interested in a potential paleotsunami during a 2013 survey of Lincoln Island, part of the Paracel chain in the hotly-disputed South China Sea. 
""We found sedimentary and biological (evidence) indicating that a tsunami occurred in the South China Sea and struck the island about a thousand years ago,"" they said.
This included large rocks and coral which had been deposited on the island far away from the coast, and could not have got there but for a massive wave. 
Computer modeling suggested the tsunami was sparked by an earthquake in the Manila Trench, a seismically active 5,400 meter (17,700 foot) deep depression off the coast of Luzon and Mindoro in the Philippines. The resultant wave is believed to have struck islands across the South China Sea, as well as the coasts of what is now Guangdong and Hainan provinces in China. 
For their latest study, Sun and Xie's team turned to Nan'ao Island in southeastern Guangdong ""to study the influence of the South China Sea tsunami."" 
Again, the researchers found shell, coral and rock deposits that had no right to be there. ""Giant boulders, typically requiring strong waves to transport, were (also) distributed near the sampling sites,"" they wrote. ""All this evidence strongly supports that the southeastern coast of the island was struck by the paleotsunami."" 
While ancient coins and pottery were found at the site, the historical record appeared to be largely cut off following the tsunami, with major activity not resuming for centuries. 
""We analyzed the temporal distribution of the cultural relics of Nan'ao Island and found that the amount of the relics significantly decreased after the tsunami and remained low until the late Ming dynasty,"" the researchers wrote. 
Beyond their archaeological and historical importance, the findings provide a real warning of the potentially devastating effect of future tsunamis on Guangdong and other parts of southern China. 
Today, more than 68 million people live in the Greater Bay Area alone, a 56,500 square kilometer (21,800 square mile) stretch of southern China encompassing Hong Kong, Macau, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and six other major cities in Guangdong province. 
As well as being heavily built up, the southern Chinese coast also plays host to seven nuclear power plants, with a further four currently under construction, according to the World Nuclear Association. 
While Chinese nuclear companies have defended their plants as ""tsunami-proof,"" the South China Morning Post reports, the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan is a pertinent reminder of the devastation a tsunami can cause when combined with a nuclear reactor. 
At Fukushima, massive waves crashed over the plant's 10 meter (32 foot) sea wall, flooding its emergency generators and knocking vital cooling systems offline, eventually leading to a major meltdown, the worst nuclear disaster since the 1986 Chernobyl incident.
Chinese authorities suspended the approval of new plants following the Fukushima disaster, and ordered a comprehensive safety review. During that audit, multiple reactors were found not to meet safety standards for flood and earthquake resistance, while others did not have sufficient tsunami protections in place. 
Following the adoption of new standards, approvals for new reactors have since resumed, including for floating nuclear plants for offshore Chinese islands. 
Sun and Xie's team said their study showed the risk of tsunamis in the South China Sea, which ""should be considered in future planning and construction of nuclear power plants."" 
In a 2007 paper examining seismic risks in the South China Sea, US and Chinese researchers pointed to the Manila Trench as the most likely cause, the same earthquake-prone region believed to have sparked the paleotsunami which struck Guangdong in 1076. 
""Tsunami earthquakes take place most likely in trench regions with a large tectonic movement and young folded crustal belts,"" the researchers wrote. ""The South China Sea with the adjacent Philippine Sea plate bordered by the Manila Trench is an excellent candidate for such devastating waves to occur.""
Moreover, they added, ""the coastal heights along the South China Sea are generally low, thus making it extremely vulnerable to incoming tsunami waves with a height of only a couple meters."" 
As much of the region is built on reclaimed land, particularly in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, the potential risks are even greater, and the researchers warned those cities could suffer a ""large-scale disaster, even if the height of the tsunami wave were moderate."" 
A tsunami which struck Indonesia last month was particularly devastating as it arrived without much warning, due in part to the extremely poor condition of the country's tsunami warning system. 
Much of the system -- introduced in the wake of the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami -- ""has not been operational since 2012,"" officials said in the wake of the disaster. Upgrades are now underway. 
China has also been ramping up its preparedness for future tsunamis, with new buoy systems deployed around the Manila Trench to warn of seismic activity in May last year. 
Most water-based tsunami detection systems feature a pressure recorder anchored to the ocean floor and a buoy on the surface. When a tsunami passes over the recorder, the instruments detect and record changes in water pressure. That data is then transmitted to the surface buoys, which relay the message to the wider tsunami detection system.
The new South China Sea systems, experts told state media, ""can issue an alert two hours before seismic sea waves arrive."" Such a warning could save millions of lives, as an earthquake of 8.5-magnitude or higher could cause waves of up to 10 meters, similar to that which flooded the Fukushima plant. 
""Previous tsunami warning systems using seismic and water level data, always made forecasts relying on people's experience, which resulted in many errors. The new warning system with numerical simulations and tsunami buoys, improves efficiency and precision,"" Shang Hongmei, a researcher at China's National Ocean Technology Center, told the news agency. 
However, while the modern citizens of southern China would hopefully have significantly more warning that a giant wave was headed their way than their ancestors did, buildings, nuclear power plants, and other infrastructure would still be in the path of the tsunami, meaning it could be equally as devastating.","A tsunami which struck southern China around a thousand years ago nearly wiped out civilization in what is now one of the most densely populated regions of the planet, according to a new study by Chinese scientists.",2019-01-03T05:19:43Z,"Ancient tsunami almost wiped out civilization in southern China, study finds",CNN,0
"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) A new opera revisits the Great Flood of 1913, a Midwestern disaster that killed hundreds, left thousands homeless, and destroyed countless bridges and businesses, but that also paved the way for flood control innovations.
The dark subject matter is well-suited to opera, said Peggy Kriha Dye, general and artistic director of Opera Columbus.
""We're used to drama and death and dealing with those topics,"" she said. ""Opera is the perfect form to do that because everything is heightened in this art form. It can handle heavy topics.""
The inundation began on Easter weekend as usually heavy rain fell on ground either frozen or already saturated from snowmelt after a harsh winter, eventually flooding most rivers and streams across the region.
The same weather system led to significant flooding in more than a dozen states, from Illinois through Connecticut, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Many smaller Ohio River communities from Cairo, Illinois, to Wheeling, West Virginia, were all but destroyed.
""The Flood,"" opening Friday at the historic Southern Theater in Columbus, is the first collaboration between Opera Columbus and the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra.
The opera tells the story of the flood through a mystery involving a family affected by the destruction. It begins in Columbus after the flood has struck and follows family members through time to the present day as the personal and public effects of the disaster are examined.
While not everyone has experienced a flood, most people are familiar with tragedy of one kind or another, said Janet Chen, ProMusica's executive director.
""There's an element within this work that I think people can take away on a personal level,"" she said.
""The Flood"" is in English and just over an hour long. It was commissioned through a $150,000 Arts Prize grant from the Columbus Foundation's Arts Innovation Fund.
Some details about the flood and its aftermath:
 The June 1912 eruption of the Novarupta volcano in Alaska 30 times more powerful than the Mount St. Helens explosion pumped so much debris into the atmosphere that it led to a long, cold ""volcanic winter."" As a result, rainfall produced by the convergence of three extreme storm fronts in late March had nowhere to go, according to historian Conrade Hinds, author of ""Columbus and the Great Flood of 1913.""
 The catastrophe began with a series of deadly tornadoes in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa that killed more than 150 people on Easter Sunday and injured hundreds more before the storm system creating the tornadoes pushed eastward.
 State historians say that at least 467 people died in Ohio during the flood, and that more than 20,000 homes were destroyed. A list of victims published in the Columbus Evening Dispatch included ""Mr. and Mrs. George Eckert and seven children."" In hard-hit Dayton, the amount of water that passed through the Great Miami River and its tributaries in three days equaled the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a month.
 In response to the flood, Ohio passed the Ohio Conservancy Law, giving the state authority to establish watershed districts, implement flood control projects and raise funds for improvements through taxes. The Miami Conservancy District was created in response to the law, becoming the first major watershed district in the nation.

"Robert Sapolsky is a professor of biology, neurology and neurosurgery at Stanford University. He is also the author of ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)Life is full of long shots that people are willing to chance: buying a lottery ticket, auditioning at a Broadway casting call, applying to a top-tier university (unless admissions happens to believe you're a water polo star). In a textbook case of long shot optimism, there are now 16 declared candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and a handful more in the wings: Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and all the other hopefuls. The American dream lives on -- with hard work and a war chest, anyone can be a presidential candidate 20 months out from the election. 
The question is why anyone should want to be one. These people have signed up for slogging through New Hampshire snows, attending town halls in Iowa, smiling and shaking hands and endlessly repeating the same phrases with just the right amount of passion in their voice. And despite all that effort, either 15 or all 16 of them will fail at their ambitious goal.
What does it take to inspire such a marathon? Of course, there are external motivating factors: Defeating Trump, improving American lives or improving the political culture. But there is also quite possibly an internal factor: Brain chemistry which, at first, seems exactly the same in humans as in other mammals, but turns out to be very different.
It all has to do with a chemical messenger called dopamine, which is released from a part of the brain called the mesolimbic dopamine system. Dogma used to be that dopamine released from neurons there mediates pleasure -- after all, cocaine works by amplifying these dopamine effects.
In actuality, dopamine is subtler than that. Take a human, monkey or lab rat, and train them as follows: when a light comes on, it signals the start of a task -- press a lever 10 times, and you get a reward (e.g., a grape for a monkey). Once this reward system is learned -- see the light, press the lever, get the treat -- when in the sequence is dopamine released from neurons? Not when the reward is delivered. Instead, it's when the light comes on, signaling the start of one of these tasks. Ah, it's the light, I know how this works, I'm totally on top of lever-pressing, this is going to be great. 
Rather than being about pleasure, dopamine is more about the anticipation of pleasure.
Furthermore, if that anticipatory rise of dopamine doesn't occur, there's no lever pressing. In other words, dopamine supplies the motivation needed to do the work required for that much-anticipated reward (and, as an aside, there's lots of evidence that there are problems with this dopamine system in people with major depression, a common symptom of which is loss of motivation). 
Now for something really interesting. In the circumstances just described, if you do the work, you receive the reward 100% of the time, guaranteed. Suppose things change so that instead when you do the work, the reward appears only half the time. What happens now when the light comes on? Far more dopamine release than when the reward is certain. Why is this? You've just introduced a key word into this neurochemistry, namely ""maybe."" Simply the possibility of a reward fuels goal-directed behavior like mad, showing the power of intermittent reinforcement. Press that lever some more, and maybe this time you'll be rewarded. 
This seems to be a basic piece of mammalian brain wiring. But there are two key differences between us and other species when it comes to the anticipatory, motivating release of dopamine. Which could help explain the drive of Amy, Bernie, Beto and the rest (as well as explain any Republicans or independents contemplating this venture).
First, for a monkey or rat, the whole signal, lever-press, reward procedure plays out over the course of seconds -- no lab rat will work now for a reward tomorrow. But we humans must be able to maintain that motivating dopamine surge for crazy long lengths of time to achieve long-term goals. After all, we lever-press to get good grades to get into a good college to get a good job to eventually get into the nursing home of our choice. We lever-press to improve the planet for our grandchildren. 
Depending on our theological ilk, we lever-press at resisting temptation to attain paradise post-mortem. And thus, odds are that each of these candidates, in those dark moments at night on the road where they'll be wondering why they're putting themselves through this, will keep going thanks to an impressive flood of dopamine.
Humans differ from other species in a second crucial way. Consider a circumstance where endless effort is required and there's only a 1-in-16 chance of getting a reward. Any sensible rat would walk at such lousy odds. It's just not worth the effort. But we can be fooled or fool ourselves into thinking that our chances are better than reality. 
After all, that's what the honorary neuroscientists who invented Las Vegas understand, where thanks to their effective manipulation, you're convinced that a one-in-a-gazillion chance is actually worth betting on. And thus, each candidate is likely to carry in their head a dopamine system fueled by a distorted sense of the odds: I've got the right demographic, the right resume, the right economic policy, the right smile to go all the way. Those other 15 don't have a chance.
This human capacity to seemingly sustain dopamine release for long periods in the face of miserable odds is how people invent new vaccines, build business empires, or end seemingly intractable societal ills. And it helps explain why this horde of candidates, intent on beating the odds, will be spending months kissing babies in places like Des Moines. All so that -- maybe, just maybe -- they eventually occupy the West Wing.","With a vast number of candidates entering the 2020 presidential race, what biologically fuels these ambitious individuals?

"(CNN)When most people tune in to their local TV news station, they're used to learning whether it's going to rain tomorrow from the trusted, familiar voice of their favorite TV meteorologist or weathercaster.
Increasingly, those viewers are also learning about the effects of climate change in their own communities from those same trusted voices. 
It was once thought to be a topic to be avoided, but many on TV have becomeemboldened to talk about this subject as their own understanding has evolved.
Ed Maibach, director of George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication, has surveyed TV weathercasters since 2010 on their opinions on climate change, as well as the incorporation of the topic into their broadcasts.
His results show a dramatic shift in the past 10 years.
In 2010, the broadcast community was split right down the middle: Fifty percent of those surveyed were convinced that humans were causing climate change, and 50% weren't. Of the half who weren't, most acknowledged that the climate is changing, they just didn't see the human connection.
What Maibach found most disturbing, however, was that a significant amount, roughly 20%, didn't even acknowledge that the climate was changing.
In his most recent survey, conducted in 2017, that number has dropped, and now 95% of broadcasters believe that the climate is changing.
Additionally, 85% of those surveyed see humans as the cause. 
Getting local with global warming
Maibach points to an initiative launched in 2010 by Climate Central, a nonprofit news organization of scientists and journalists who research and reports on climate change, called Climate Matters. As an academic researcher, Maibach partners with Climate Central on the project, tracking the use of the materials and investigating their effectiveness. 
The program provided weathercasters with tools they previously lacked: localized climate data tailored to a specific TV market.
Jim Gandy, a local TV meteorologist in the deep red state of South Carolina, launched the pilot Climate Matters project, and Maibach gauged the success of the program by surveying viewers from Gandy's and competitors' stations.
""We found that the more viewers watched Jim's station, the more likely their views on climate change evolved,"" Maibach said.
""They recognized that it was happening, and it was happening to them locally. Those results gave us confidence to know that when broadcast meteorologists talked to their audiences about climate change, it helped viewers understand that this is real and it's impacting them.""
Gandy strives to avoid the politics and stick to the facts of the science.
""When you tell people that this is the fifth hottest summer on record, they kind of look at you like, 'really?' ""
Gandy has been tracking trends in his state and noticed something that really got his attention. ""In heat waves of the past, it may have been blazing hot in the daytime; at least you got a little bit of relief at night. You're not getting any relief at night here now.""
He rightly reasoned that lack of warmth overnight was connected to higher humidity due to a generally warmer climate. That warmer atmosphere allows for the capture of more moisture, a connection he was able to point out to his viewers.
Though summer's heat might be dismissed by some, even when confronted by the temperature facts, Gandy points to other signs that are harder to dismiss, such as things viewers have probably experienced.
""People complain about the weeds in our yards because they're growing faster these days. Why is that? Not because I'm fertilizing the yard. We're seeing more evasive species coming into this area. Why? Because our climate is getting warmer, and you know, you can deny climate change until you're blue in the face, but you can't deny reality.""
Viewers receptive to climate information
Research is backing up the conclusion that viewers react positively to climate change information being presented by TV weathercasters.
According to a study released this month by researchers at George Mason University, 70% of viewers surveyed were interested in learning about climate change from TV segments. Even among those who identified themselves as unconvinced about climate change, a majority were opento seeing climate change information tailored to their locality. 
The public's appetite for climate information is being noticed by local TV weathercasters.
In 2005, when Ryan Hanrahan took a position as a meteorologist with the NBC affiliate in Hartford, Connecticut, he was not focused on climate change. 
""It wasn't so much that I didn't believe it was happening, but rather, I saw my job as telling people what to wear tomorrow, the chance of thunderstorms and to track hurricanes."" In fact, he says, he shied away from talking about it for the first five years at the station.
But now, he's seeing a different trend: viewers posing more climate questions. 
""This summer, for instance, we had three tornadoes within the span of a few weeks, and I saw comments on social media asking, 'Why aren't you talking about the link with climate change?' "" 
His outreach is also an attempt to meet viewers where they are and address practical concerns.
""I think a lot of people are really curious and need someone to distill what seems like an abstract science and tell them 'how is this going to affect my backyard? How is this going to affect my property values? Am I going to be placed into a flood zone?' ""
Thanks to materials from Climate Matters, Hanrahan is able to provide that kind of localized data and help viewers understand what it means for them. 
The success of local TV weathercasters like Gandy and Hanrahan has allowed Maibach to secure additional funding from the National Science Foundation to expand the Climate Matters program, and as a result, he has seen exponential growth in the number of broadcasters incorporating climate change into their presentations.
""By 2014, we had 100 meteorologists using the materials,"" Maibach said. ""From there, we went to 300 in 2016, and now we're almost at 600.""
But the growth in red states has really surprised him.
""We're doing very well in Texas, which is a deep red state, and Florida, which leans red,"" Maibach said.
""From what I've seen, broadcasters in red states are being pretty fearless. They're getting the job done, and they're not shying away from the truth. And I think that's a really good story to tell.""",TV meteorologists and weathercasters are increasingly teaching viewers about the effects of climate change.,2019-03-08T09:04:05Z,Explaining climate change: The new role of the TV weathercaster,CNN,0
"Joshua A. Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of the forthcoming book, ""Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting."" Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)Dear Sen. Mitch McConnell,
As a professor of election law and voting rights at the University of Kentucky College of Law -- your state's flagship institution and your alma mater -- I invite you to come sit in on my election law class. Given your recent commentary on the subject, it might teach you a lot.
For instance, you can learn about the true merits of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a proposed law that Democrats in Congress have introduced to completely revamp our elections. Yes, it would include a provision to make Election Day a federal holiday as part of a suite of reforms to improve voter turnout. 
You mocked the holiday idea on the Senate floor this week (and in your recent Washington Post op-ed) while ignoring the comprehensive nature of the election reform package. You claim it's all part of a Democratic ""power grab."" Senator, are you really afraid of more eligible people going to the polls?
The law includes many reforms -- like automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement, improved election security, and methods to make voting more convenient -- that all amount to one thing: modernizing our election system for everyone.
What's more, the law would enact numerous ideas that are already working in various states and localities throughout the country. It is aimed at bringing more eligible voters into our political process. In fact, several Republican-controlled states have enacted some of these reforms.
Take automatic voter registration, which is sweeping the nation. The idea is built on a simple premise: When the government already has information about voters, such as through the Department of Motor Vehicles office, it should simply add that information to the voter registration rolls. Voter registration is often an unnecessary barrier to voter participation, and states can eliminate that barrier by automatically registering valid voters in this way.
Far from a ruse that registers invalid voters (an assertion from your op-ed that the Washington Post later corrected), it would simply make it easier for more people to participate in our elections. In fact, automatic voter registration actually improves election integrity by helping states clean up their voter rolls.
In 2016, Oregon was the first state to adopt automatic voter registration, and the idea has now spread to places like Alaska, Georgia and West Virginia -- hardly Democratic strongholds. More than a dozen states have enacted automatic voter registration. Perhaps most impressively, this reform has led to improved voter turnout.
Sen. McConnell, your commentary also attacked H.R. 1's plans for campaign finance reform and greater disclosure of who is spending money in campaigns. You claim that with the bill, Democrats would be ""coming after free speech."" Not so. Though you may oppose disclosure, the Supreme Court has declared that greater disclosure is the way to solve many of the problems of our campaign finance system and, in almost all circumstances, is perfectly legal under the First Amendment.
As for publicly funded Democracy Vouchers that voters can give to candidates to fund their campaigns -- used successfully in Seattle -- the idea is to insert more money into our political system. But instead of having wealthy interests and groups that obscure their identity flood our airwaves, Democracy Vouchers, as a form of public financing, would allow everyday Americans to have a say in who receives campaign funds and democratize who has the financial ability to run for office.
Ironically, you assert that ""Americans [don't] see an urgent need for their tax dollars to be used to bankroll robocalls and attack ads,"" yet in heralding Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and supporting the deregulation of campaign finance, you seem to have no problem with more money being inserted into our political system so long as it comes from wealthy interests who can obscure their identities.
You also suggested it is a power grab to change the Federal Election Commission from its current system of having three members appointed by each political party to having a 3-2 split. Right now the FEC is largely ineffectual, as it often deadlocks on a 3-3 vote (and right now it has only four members, the minimum for a quorum). Having an odd number of commissioners would help the agency actually enforce federal campaign finance laws. And the proposal would simply give an advantage to whichever party is currently in the White House, Republican or Democrat.
Now, there may be better ways to reform the agency, and perhaps giving the party in power more control might help them entrench themselves if they set out rules for the next election -- but that's true for both parties.
H.R. 1 also includes numerous other proposals that, once again, already work well in various states and localities. Everyday Americans -- such as the ""democracy champions"" I profile in my forthcoming book who have worked to improve our democracy through sustained advocacy for positive voting rights reforms -- desperately want these enhancements to our election system.
For instance, voters are clamoring for independent redistricting commissions, as the results of the five states to vote on the idea in 2018 showed: All five measures passed. That includes both red and blue states, like Utah and Michigan. Americans understand that voters should pick their politicians and not the other way around.
The proposed law would also restore the right to vote to felons who have completed their sentences, reversing a policy that harms minority voters in particular and strips millions of the core aspect of their citizenship. Plenty of states all across the country -- including Florida, this past November through a ballot initiative -- have eased their felon disenfranchisement rules.
In addition to declaring Election Day a national holiday, which, to be sure, has its own complexities, such as potentially harming hourly employees, the law would also expand early voting and vote-by-mail/vote-at-home opportunities.
The law would require a verified paper trail to enhance the security and integrity of our election system.
It would improve access for voters with disabilities.
It would impose more rigorous ethics requirements on our public officials.
In sum, H.R. 1 would modernize America's election system for everyone. That should be the goal: let's make it easy for all eligible Americans to participate and allow the best candidates and best ideas -- and not election rules -- dictate the outcomes.
Sen. McConnell, I promise that my election law class presents a fair, unbiased overview of our election system and the numerous laws and regulations involved. We can debate the merits of some of the proposals in H.R. 1, but one thing is clear: States and localities are already seeing success with many of these ideas, modernizing their elections and bringing more people into the political process.
Isn't that something that all sides should want? Shouldn't everyone champion improved voter participation?
I invite you to the classroom anytime you are available.","Election law professor Joshua Douglas writes: Sen.

"arts Published 14th December 2018 This article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here. For years, all of Kawanabe Kysai's prints and paintings bore the same inscription: Shj Kysai. The second word, which roughly translates to ""crazy studio,"" is the name he chose for himself right around the time he was becoming famous throughout Japan. The first, meaning ""drunk,"" is a little harder to explain. In part, the word was a cheeky way of disavowing artworks that might anger too many powerful people, which they quite often did. His 1874 woodblock print ""School for Spooks, No.3,"" from the series ""Drawings for Pleasure,"" shows a swarm of slimy, green demons squeezed into tiny desks and awkward-fitting Western clothes, a clear knock at the compulsory education system the Meiji government had mandated two years prior. Images like this one earned the artist a prison sentence, plus 50 lashes. ""Shj"" also implied that Kysai, 19th-century Japan's most notorious artist, only came alive when he was smashed. Rumored to drink three bottles of sake every day by noon, he specialized in dense, eye-poppingly colorful scenes of demons and beasts that most of us wouldn't dare imagine while sober. Counterintuitively, he was also a clean, precise draftsman, a workaholic who left behind hundreds of prints, paintings, and sketches. Many scholars of manga, the most popular form of Japanese comics, have credited Kysai with inventing the genre in 1874. On the strength of this oeuvre -- fantastical, yet rooted in real-life political and cultural happenings -- he is remembered as a master caricaturist, the great insult comic of Japan during some of the bumpiest decades in the country's history. Legends cling to Kysai's life like beads of moisture to the bottles of booze he hoarded. According to one story, at the age of nine, he found a severed head floating in a river, fished it out, and drew it over and over again until his horrified parents took it away from him. Fact or fiction, this story conveys an important truth about Kysai, or, rather, Shzabur, as he was known until adulthood. His precocity pulled him down paths few people would be willing to follow. While studying with the painter Maemura Twa in the early 1840s, he earned the nickname shuchu gaki, or ""demon of painting,"" an epithet he'd wear with pride for years to come. All demons need something to work their mischief on, and for much of Kysai's career, modern -- or, more to the point, modernizing -- Japan was his favorite target. In 1854, the year Kysai turned 23, the Tokugawa shogunate signed an economic treaty with the United States, opening up Japan to a flood of Western culture, cash, and technology. When reformist leaders dissolved the shogunate 14 years later, the processes of industrialization sped up: Factories and European fashions buried the feudal system, a development the Japanese people viewed with a mixture of pride and wistfulness. In depicting the changing times, Kysai applied his distinctive humor to many traditional themes and genres. The results were -- at least judging by the subject matter -- similar to works by any number of other artists, but original and utterly modern in execution. Hyakki yagyõ, the ancient Japanese legend of the ""Night parade of 100 demons,"" has probably inspired thousands of paintings and prints over the centuries, but few of these can rival Kysai's for sheer inventiveness. The artisans keeping Japan's woodblock print tradition alive In one 1889 illustration, a horde of skeleton soldiers rushes onward, one skeleton leading the charge on a horse with the head of a man. As with much of Kysai's very best work, the luridness doesn't come from any single source so much as the accumulation of fine, sickly details, like the pink, almost pornographic tongue dangling from the horse-man's mouth. First these details creep up on you, then they overpower you. In his prints and paintings, Kysai was especially adept at crowd scenes. He delighted in packing herds of animals, monsters, and people tight into the frame. These scenes epitomize his attack on post-1854 Japanese society: In the era of rapid change, chaos was king, few seemed to know what was going on, and Western culture spread like a virus. There's probably no better example of Kysai's brand of social satire than the enormous He-gassen -- literally, ""fart competition"" or ""fart battle"" -- scroll he completed in 1868. The history of He-gassenm, a weird and distinctly Japanese genre founded on a timeless kind of raunchy humor, deserves its own article. But what's most fascinating about Kysai's contribution to this hallowed genre, completed in the year the Meiji Restoration began, is the way he pairs the usual bathroom gags with subtle political commentary. On close inspection, the real targets of his satire are Japanese people straining to become Westerners, adopting Western clothes and affecting a dignified, pseudo-Victorian demeanor. In response to all this pompous wind, Kysai offers some wind of his own. Kysai's impatience with Japanese society got him in serious trouble more than once. In 1870, he was whipped and briefly imprisoned for allegedly drawing acts of sodomy between Westerners and Japanese (a none-too-subtle metaphor, we can surmise, for what Kysai thought the West was doing to his country). But he remained popular and prolific. If anything, his work after 1870 became more incisive, though he continued to couch his satire in fantasy and folklore. In 1874, Kysai, along with his close friend Kanagaki Robun, founded E-shinbun Nipponchi, considered by some to be the first manga magazine. The magazine -- which combined the serial form of the He-gassen scroll with the cosmopolitanism of Punch, the leading English humor publication of the age -- never really gained traction, and folded after only three issues. But its simple, whimsical style inspired dozens of imitators in late 19th century, and its present-day descendants are legion, as anybody who's ever walked into a comic book store can attest. One recent study found that manga makes up almost a quarter of all books sales in Japan. The mind of Takashi Murakami It's odd that Kysai, one of the harshest satirists of Westernization, had no problem with taking artistic inspiration from an English magazine like Punch. But if he was critical of Europe's economic presence in his country, he was by no means anti-Europe. Rather than dismiss the new medium of photography as a French trifle, as plenty of his contemporaries did, he incorporated it into the art classes he taught in the last decade of his life, even encouraging his students to paint from photographic images. One of these students, a British architect named Josiah Conder, eventually became one of his closest friends. It was Conder who penned Kysai's obituary when he died in 1889. ""To him,"" Conder wrote of his friend and idol, ""there always existed a great El Dorado of art beyond the limit of the lights into which he was born and within the radius of which his own opportunities compelled him to work."" (Did he know about the fart battles?) The obituary gets less lofty, and considerably more poignant, when Conder describes Kysai's final painting, a self-portrait he completed just a few days before his death: ""A weird outline of his own emaciated form, bent and tottering as he stood to paint, and suffering from the symptoms of his fatal disease."" It's tragic, but somehow fitting, that after a lifetime spent lampooning modern Japan, Kysai finally turned his pitiless gaze back upon himself.","Kyōsai, 19th-century Japan's most notorious artist, only came alive when he was smashed.

"James Piltch's writing on civic life and education has appeared in The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and The Chronicle of Higher Education. He is David Gergen's chief research assistant. David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School.

 (CNN)As Nancy Pelosi takes charge of the House of Representatives, she is making history in more ways than one. Not only is she the first woman to be elected speaker of the House in two stints; not only has she stood up successfully to President Trump in the Oval Office with cameras whirring; not only did she deftly compromise with dissidents in her ranks in order to retain power. Nancy Pelosi is also the woman now at the forefront of a potential revolution in American politics. 
Despite her unpopularity in GOP districts around the country, Pelosi has become the central player in an unfolding drama, the plot of which centers around one question: Whether the flood of new women into Congress this year can begin the renewal of the badly broken political system that is increasingly holding back the country. 
Since the election of Donald Trump, women of all ages and backgrounds have become more civically engaged, especially on the Democratic side. In the 2015-2016 political cycle, for example, fewer than 1,000 women called Emily's List, an organization that seeks to elect Democratic women to office, for help in launching political bids from city halls to Congress. In 2018, more than 40,000 called Emily's List interested in a political run. 
It cannot be stressed enough that, so far, Democratic women have been winning many more elections than Republican women. Indeed, Democratic women have increased their numbers in the House from 64 two years ago to 89 today, while the number of Republican women has decreased from 23 to 13. Smart Republicans are now scrambling to have more women join the parade. 
Regardless of the paltry GOP representation, the fact is that women across the nation are opening the door wide so more of their numbers can, in the words of ""Hamilton,"" ""be in the room where it happens."" Their arrival is welcome news for the future of politics. 
Social science studies and public polling over the past several years indicate that women being in these halls of political power will likely bring positive changes in governance. In fact, a large increase in female leaders could be a saving grace for the country's hyperpolarized, venomous politics. They may just be better at leading than men.
Barbara Kellerman, a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author of several books on leadership, writes about effective leadership as a system in which the strengths of leaders, the needs of followers, and the demands of context all align properly. At this moment, women in leadership roles fit extremely well with the country's needs. 
When it comes to the respective leadership strengths of different genders, it's hard to be sure what is absolutely, verifiably true. But research suggests women possess two leadership qualities that our country needs right now. In her book, ""Women in the Club,"" Georgetown University professor Michele Swers explains that women are able to influence change in oft-ignored policy arenas. She writes, ""Women are able to leverage their gender to influence policy debates on a range of issues from health care and education to abortion rights and pay equity."" 
But women in public office don't just bring needed attention to these issues. They also have distinct enough experiences from men that female elected officials bring new ideas on how to fix problems in essentially every realm, from foreign policy to the economy. Given the gridlock slowing down Washington, the looming threat of climate change, and an economy at risk of tanking, all of which place stress on Americans and their families, fresh ideas and a new agenda are critical for correcting the current government malaise. 
As critical as new policies are, the country needs more than just ideas. It needs elected officials who will rebuild faith in government. Fortunately, women tend to bring something as leaders that is sorely lacking in Washington: Ethics and integrity. Alice Eagly writes in ""Through the Labyrinth"" that women are seemingly less likely to encourage unethical practices when on corporate boards or other positions of leadership than men. 
Although research confirming Eagly's findings remains limited, people who work with women who lead agree that they are more likely to be ethical and honest than men. A 2012 study by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman, published in theHarvard Business Review, found that employees of female leaders rate the average female leader significantly higher than the average male leader when asked to what degree the leaders display ""high integrity and honesty."" 
While the context in Washington is ripe for the strengths that female leaders would bring, the same question that has long held female leadership back remains: Is the electorate ready for women to lead? The recent election and polling suggest that Americans now want what they believe women bring to the table. 
Pew reports that 61% of Americans believe women are more likely to be compassionate and empathetic as political leaders. It also found that Americans overwhelmingly believe female leaders are more likely to stand up for what they believe in and do so in a civil way than male leaders. Americans' faith in female leadership is critically important given people's lack of trust in government. Electing women, then, seems like a logical first step toward restoring that trust. The context, followers and leaders seem to have aligned.
However, Pew also found Americans hold a lingering stereotype that might prevent them from voting for women: They believe women are less willing to take necessary risks compared to men. But this stereotype is inaccurate, as recent events have shown. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fearlessly led in Europe, often making decisions that were politically unpopular, including allowing millions of migrants into the country. Sen. Lisa Murkowski just months ago proved willing to risk her political standing to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Most recently, Pelosi proved herself as risk-taking and strategic as any politician these last few weeks in her showdowns with the President and members of her own party. 
Social science and national need suggest this new class of women in Congress -- which will be the largest in history -- should be just the beginning of a new political movement. Looking toward the future, there's one last finding from the Zenger and Folkman study that might be relevant to Democrat voters and leaders come February 2020 when the presidential primary begins: The closer men and women get to the highest levels of power, the more their employees believe women are better leaders than men.","Given the gridlock slowing down Washington, the fresh ideas and new agendas that women bring to the table are critical for correcting the current government malaise, write James Piltch and David Gergen",2019-01-03T23:09:30Z,Why Nancy Pelosi is good for America,CNN,0
"WAYNESVILLE, Mo. Five minutes late, Darrell Todd Maurina sweeps into a meeting room and plugs in his laptop computer. He places a Wi-Fi hotspot on the table and turns on a digital recorder. The earplug in his left ear is attached to a police scanner in his pants pocket.
He wears a tie; Maurina insists upon professionalism.
He is the press in its entirety.
Maurina, who posts his work to Facebook, is the only person who has come to the Pulaski County courthouse to tell residents what their commissioners are up to, the only one who will report on their deliberations specifically, their discussions about how to satisfy the Federal Emergency Management Agency so it will pay to repair a road inundated during a 2013 flood.
Last September, Waynesville became a statistic. With the shutdown of its newspaper, the Daily Guide, this town of 5,200 people in central Missouris Ozark hills joined more than 1,400 other cities and towns across the U.S. to lose a newspaper over the past 15 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by the University of North Carolina.
Blame revenue siphoned by online competition, cost-cutting ownership, a death spiral in quality, sheer disinterest among readers or reasons peculiar to given locales for that development. While national outlets worry about a president who calls the press an enemy of the people, many Americans no longer have someone watching the City Council for them, chronicling the soccer exploits of their children or reporting on the kindly neighbor who died of cancer.
Local journalism is dying in plain sight.
A rock outcropping painted by a local tattoo artist to resemble a frog greets visitors who follow the old Route 66 into Waynesville. Along with its sister city St. Robert, the military towns are dominated by the nearby Fort Leonard Wood, which has kept the countys population steadily around 50,000 for the past decade.
Five of Waynesvilles eight City Council members are former military, and Mayor Luge Hardman says the meetings run efficiently as a result.
This is a small town where you can be from somewhere else and not feel like an outsider, said Kevin Hillman, Pulaski County prosecuting attorney.
The Daily Guide, which traces its roots to 1962, was a family owned paper into the 1980s before it was sold to a series of corporate owners that culminated with GateHouse Media Inc., the nations largest newspaper company. Five of the 10 largest media companies are owned by hedge funds or other investors with several unrelated holdings, and GateHouse is among them.
GateHouse and another company, Digital First Media, follow a strategy of aggressive cost-cutting without making significant investments in newsrooms, said Penelope Muse Abernathy, a University of North Carolina professor who studies news industry trends. But all newspaper owners face a brutal reality that calls into question whether its an economically sustainable model anymore unless, like the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, the boss is the worlds richest man.
Thats especially true in smaller communities.
Theyre getting eaten away at every level, said Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst at Harvards Nieman Lab.
Newspaper circulation in the U.S. has declined every year for three decades, while advertising revenue has nosedived since 2006, according to the Pew Research Center. Staffing at newspapers large and small has followed that grim trendline: Pew says the number of reporters, editors, photographers and other newsroom employees in the industry fell by 45 percent nationwide between 2004 and 2017.
In the mid-1990s, when former Daily Guide publisher Tim Berrier was replaced, the newspaper had a news editor, sports editor, photographer and two reporters on staff. Along with traditional community news, the Daily Guide covered the Armys decision to move its chemical warfare training facility to Fort Leonard Wood in the 1990s, and a flood that swept a mother and son to their deaths in 2013.
As recently as 2010, the Daily Guide had four full-time news people, along with a page designer and three ad salespeople.
But people left and werent replaced. Last spring, the Daily Guide was cut from five to three days a week. In June, the last newsroom staffer, editor Natalie Sanders, quit she was burned out, she said. She made a bet with the only other full-time employee, ad sales person Tiffany Baker, over when the newspaper would close. Sanders said three years; Baker said one.
The last edition was published three months later, on Sept. 7.
It felt like an old friend died, Sanders said. I sat and I cried, I really did. Because being the editor of the Daily Guide was all I wanted for a really long time.
Residents of Waynesville are coming to grips with what is missing in their lives.
Losing a newspaper, said Keith Pritchard, 63, chairman of the board at the Security Bank of Pulaski County and a lifelong resident, is like losing the heartbeat of a town.
Pritchard has scrapbooks of news clippings about his three daughters; Katie was a basketball player of some renown at Drury University. He wonders: How will young families collect such memories?
The local state representative, Steve Lynch, would routinely cut out a story about people recognized in the paper, add a personal note, laminate it and send it to them a savvy goodwill exercise.
Historians worry about what is lost to future generations. Many of the displays in a small museum of local history in St. Robert are stories retrieved from newspapers.
Residents talk with dismay about church picnics or school plays they might have attended but only learn of through Facebook postings after the fact.
I miss the newspaper, the chance to sit down over a cup of coffee and a bagel or a doughnut ... and find out whats going on in the community, said Bill Slabaugh, a retiree. Now he talks to friends and candidly, for the most part, Im ignorant.
At a time when journalists and police are often at odds, its somewhat startling to hear local law enforcement unanimously express dismay at the loss of a newspaper.
Like many communities, Waynesville is struggling with a drug problem. The nearby interstate is an easy supply line for opioids and meth, police say. The four murders in Waynesville last year were the most in memory, and all were drug-related.
For painful, personal reasons, Pulaski County Sheriff Jimmy Bench wishes the Daily Guide was there to report on the December death of his 31-year-old son, Ryan, due to a heroin overdose. It would have been better than dealing with whispers and Twitter.
Social media is so cruel sometimes, Bench said.
Without a newspapers reporting, Police Chief Dan Cordova said many in the community are unaware of the extent of the drug problem. Useful information, like a spate of robberies in one section of town, goes unreported. Social media is a resource, but Cordova is concerned about not reaching everyone.
Local authorities still write news releases and, in the final days of the Daily Guide, the overworked staff often printed them verbatim even giving front-page bylines to the marketing director for the Waynesville School District.
I thought it was great, said Waynesville School Superintendent Brian Henry, later adding: Nobodys really stepped in and filled exactly what we had with our newspaper.","WAYNESVILLE, Mo. • Five minutes late, Darrell Todd Maurina sweeps into a meeting room and plugs in his laptop computer.

"The man on the train platform who spoke only Hindi looked at my ticket and chuckled. This had been one of those days when mistakes piled up faster than I could track them.
 I had tarried too long in Chandigarh, India, and the four-hour taxi ride back to New Delhi now promised to be a six-hour slog in traffic. No problem, I could take a train instead, I thought, only to run out of money on my cellphone SIM card just as I was booking a last-minute ticket. I hopped in a tuk tuk and raced to the station, and got there five minutes after the last fast train had left for the night.
When I started this harebrained experiment in January, to visit and report on the Timess entire 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, I thought that by stop 48, for sure, Id be the Wonder Woman of travel: blocking mishaps with a flick of my wrist. Instead I was staring down a 2 a.m. arrival in New Delhi before having to force myself awake for a morning plane to Bhutan.
But there was the man on the platform a waiter for the railway, whose job it is to pass out dinners flashing a gesture that seemed to mean, Dont worry, Ive got you. I had bought an unreserved ticket, which I thought was for people whod had trouble purchasing online, but which really meant Id likely have to stand for five hours.
 But when the train pulled in, the man talked to the conductor and ushered me into a sleeper car. English-speakers all around jumped in to interpret. Seven dollars in fines and upgrade fees later, I was sitting in a cluster of bunks with four boisterous 20-something women from New Delhi. 
The words dream job come up whenever I tell people about the 52 Places project. Like the thousands of others who answered that fateful job listing travel the world for The New York Times! I had a vision of winning a journalism lottery, of getting to leave behind my routine to swim in waterfalls in Australia, paraglide off mountaintops in Switzerland and eat at Michelin-starred restaurants in France. And I got to do all of those things, for which I am incredibly grateful. 
Ive also had to face reality: that constant travel alone on an illogical route no sane human would plan, might take a toll on my physical and mental well-being. That The Times, quite reasonably, expected me to do work and file stories, which meant spending a lot of time in beautiful destinations in front of a computer. That Id make gaffes along the way and have to weather the sting of valid criticism. That Id meet new friends only to have to say goodbye a few days later. And that Id be mostly celibate, miss the births of four close friends babies, forget to call my parents. That Id reach the end, and all Id want is to do it over again.
I started out, arms laden with recommendations and highlights, determined to do every one of them: Eat all the food in New Orleans, hike to the sea cave everyone goes to in Tasmania, visit every mountain temple in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Yet what I remember most are the small wins and human connections. The kind people and delicious salchipapas (deconstructed hot dogs with French fries) at a Peruvian food truck on the highway outside Disney Springs, Fla. The man in Lucerne, Switzerland, who returned my laptop when I left it on a bridge in the rain. That army of concerned citizens in Chandigarh.
Trust has been the through-line that has emerged from it all. Trust in myself, trust in the fundamental goodness of people, trust that as a solo female traveler, I could watch my back without walling myself off from experiences.
You see, it was a dream job. Its just that my idea of what made this dream job dreamy has changed so much.
I was going on 40, feeling sad about being single, and contemplating a sabbatical from New York Magazine, where Id worked for 17 years, when I clicked on The New York Times home page and saw something curious: A job listing in the most-read articles list. Did I want to travel around the world and document it? it asked. Sure I did! So did pretty much everyone. By the time I saw the listing, 3,500 people had already applied. The final number, they tell me, was 13,000.
The odds were so impossible and the selection process so mysterious that I couldnt allow myself to get too excited. And then I got the incredible phone call telling me I had three weeks to pack up my apartment, say goodbye to everyone I knew, quit a workplace that felt like family and set out for a year on the road. 
All through my 20s and 30s, I had watched friends move to London or West Africa, or quit their jobs and travel, and wondered how they possibly had the confidence to do it. I had made the huge, scary leap from New Mexico to New York City after college because it was the one big city I knew, and I had family there. And then I stayed at the same workplace, building a career I loved while living in a series of closet-size walk-ups and earning barely enough money to go home for the holidays.
Why do you think they picked you? interviewers often asked me, and I didnt know the answer. I suspected it was because I hadnt done anything like this before. Id never been brave enough. And maybe I could be a representative for those who didnt think they were brave enough, either.
Getting on that first plane to New Orleans, I felt as though I were stepping into an unknowable void from which there was no return. The first few months were tough. Five stops in, and behind on my writing, I wound up in Bogotá, Colombia, still needing to file my articles on Montgomery, Ala. (stop No. 3) and Disney Springs, Fla. (stop No. 4). I spent three straight days in my Bogotá hotel, losing precious time to report on and photograph the city. The one day I got outside, I took a taxi 30 minutes to the museum I wanted to see and realized Id left my wallet back at the hotel.
And I just lost it. 
I called a dear friend of mine who works for The Wall Street Journal and has made many a global move, and sobbed.
I know this feels daunting right now, she said, but you have to remember that a year is short.
I argued that this was the longest year of my life, and it was only February, and she didnt know what she was talking about. But the saying stuck in my head and acquired new meaning whenever Id hear myself complain about this wondrous opportunity.
Freezing down to your bones and sleeping in a by-the-hour motel where you shower while sitting on the toilet? Suck it up! Youre about to see the rainbow hills of Zhangye, China! A year is short.
Freezing again and dinner is bar nuts because you waited past 8 p.m., when all the restaurants close? You just rode a horse in Iceland! A year is short.
Car got towed in Auckland, New Zealand, while on your third trip to the Chinese consulate trying to get a visa? But youre in New Zealand! And youre going to China! A year is short.
A year is short and a year is not enough.
A year is short, and I was strong, and the risk had always been worth it.
My 27-hour travel day from Kanazawa, Japan, to India, was one of the trickiest of the year and I had gamed it out to the minute: A 4 a.m. taxi to the Kanazawa station, where Id pick up luggage Id left in a locker; a six-hour train ride with two transfers, arriving at the Osaka airport with a generous two and a half hours to check in for my flight. Id filled out the longest form in the world to get my India eVisa and paid to get it expedited. And I had a ticket for onward travel to Bhutan, having anticipated that India would require me to show Id booked travel to exit the country before I could get on the plane in Japan.
Then the AirAsia ticket counter woman asked if I had a paper copy of my eVisa. I hadnt thought to print it out. Nowhere else in the world, in 47 stops, had I needed to show anything but my phone at a check-in counter.
She couldnt let me on the flight without it, she said. Check-in was closing in 20 minutes. After a mad scramble, I ended up in line at a Family Mart convenience store behind a woman printing out what looked like a 40-page dissertation, watching as the clock ticked down. The complicated printer setup required downloading an app to my phone, and by the time I had printed it out, Id missed the deadline by 15 minutes. 
I raced up two flights of escalators and down several long corridors, carrying the bags I hadnt been allowed to check, prepared to beg the ticket agent for leniency. By some miracle the line was still open. I handed everything over, smiling with relief, and then looked up to see my plane was on a 2-hour delay.
So like any reasonable person, I went back to the Family Mart and bought a basket full of sushi snacks and tea-flavored Kit Kats, plus a beer to take the edge off. 
Id estimate that at least 60 percent of this job was dealing with logistics. And I even had a helper back in New York, who would research hotels and flights for me.
Every country is different, with different currencies and different languages, a different pace and different cultural customs. An unreserved train ticket means one thing in India and another in Spain. Had I done cursory research on the dual-island African nation of São Tomé and Príncipe, I would have known to show up with a wad of euros, because the society is completely cash-based and there are no ATMs foreigners can use. 
At first, I tried following travel conventions that had worked for me on one-off trips: booking planes and hotels in advance, picking the absolute cheapest fares, guarding against delays by taking 6 a.m. flights, which are the least likely to be canceled. Then four 6 a.m. flights in a row, with the necessary 3 a.m. wake-up calls, turned me into a zombie.
I started listening to my rhythms. I am a night owl, for one, happy to wake up for sunrises but usually not for planes. Inflexible travel plans give me anxiety, particularly when they were coupled with work deadlines.
The trip had been planned to go from west to east, minimizing jet lag, but some time zone changes knocked me out. The 24-hour travel day from Zambia to Darwin, Australia, knocked me out for days.
Ive become far calmer from having to deal with mishap after mishap, and realizing that nothing dire usually happens. There would be another plane, and more trains if I missed that one, too. Maybe Id lose a day, but when youre on the road this long, time becomes malleable, too.
So what countries are you going to? asked Tina Phillips, a nurse at Passport Health in Orlando, Fla., which issues vaccinations and prescriptions for travelers who might encounter infectious diseases like malaria, rabies or Japanese encephalitis.
I started listing off my 52 Places destinations. Ms. Phillips typed the country names into the computer, her eyes widening as she laughed at the absurdity. She sent me home with several needle sticks in my arm, $1,100 in preventive medicine, a video message telling my mother not to worry, and a spiral-bound printout of all my health vulnerabilities. 
One of my biggest fears going into this project was getting sick, or injured, and having to come home early or worse, having something happen while I was in a remote location without access to adequate medical care. Getting sick is painful, and often gross, but what worried me more was the potential time suck on a trip so tightly scheduled that it would go off the rails if I spent days groaning on a hotel bathroom floor.
My waistline has expanded and diminished throughout this trip, but the medical kits I built so meticulously before I left the U.S. have remained largely untouched in my suitcase. Its a stash so extensive that a customs officer at the ferry entrance to Tangier, Morocco, spent an hour threatening, in Arabic, to confiscate it and accusing me of being a drug dealer.
Instead, I discovered I have a superpower, which may be the sole reason Ive stayed relatively healthy: the ability to sleep anywhere, under any conditions. Give me a window seat on an airplane and Ill be lights out before takeoff, no earplugs, eye mask or neck pillow. 
Id fall asleep in hotels on noisy streets as dogs barked all night, and in 20-minute chunks, regulated by an alarm, between writing paragraphs of articles on an all-nighter. In Tangier, two friends who joined me started looking like death because of hourlong prayer calls outside our windows every morning at 4 a.m. I didnt even notice them.
But the only times Ive gotten really sick were the colds I caught in Seville, Spain, and Chandigarh after extensive sleep deprivation. I warded them off with a lot of naps.
The rain in Chilean Patagonia never really seemed to stop. Every article of clothing I owned was soaked. Soppy socks, soppy shoes. The weather matched my mood. Earlier that week, Id called my friend crying yet again, and told her I wanted to quit I was so far behind in writing it felt like I was drowning in obligations I couldnt meet. 
What do people do when it rains like this? I asked the hotel manager in the national park, Parque Pumalín. We do what we always do, he said. If we stopped for rain, nothing would ever get done.
So, in a small break in the rain, I went out to do what I always do: take pictures, talk to people, get to know the place.
I was in the tiny town of Chaitén, which had been leveled by a volcanic eruption 10 years earlier. Residents had come back, but the buildings closest to the slope were still abandoned. I went to examine the ghost town. A few friendly construction workers were rebuilding a house, a school. I wandered further, to an industrial building that had been overtaken by jungle growth straight out of Jurassic Park.
The rain started up again while I was inside, exploring the concrete corridors and coming to the realization that I was inside an abandoned prison.
And now I was trapped by torrential rain.
For two hours I watched the rain flood the dirt streets before me, and the inside of this prison. I tweeted out my location, just in case. Then my phones battery died, and it was just me and the torrent, alone in the wilds of Patagonia, with the sun going down.
I had to make a decision, and the decision was to run, through the rain. And in that rain, soaked and running, I looked around, at the blue-tinged mountains around me, and the jungle shrubs on all sides, and the kind people laughing at this silly foreigner whod gotten caught in an abandoned prison in the rain, and realized that all the rest was superfluous. This was why I was here.
Something crystallized for me in that moment, of how singular this trip was. I started trying things: I jumped off a 30-foot cliff into freezing river water while canyoning in Megève, France; scuba dived and surfed for the first time in Fiji; and maybe scariest of all, tried a taco with a crispy-fried ant at Gustu in La Paz, Bolivia.
Two days ago, my friend Ben saw a dish on the menu of a barbecue joint in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, he thought I should try to commemorate making it to my 52nd place.
Come on, he said. After this you can tell everyone you tried Fried Spicy Cow Penis.
The whole table agreed to join me. We ordered it and the kitchen brought out Fried Spicy Beef instead. We changed it for you! they said, cheerily.
Awesome, said Ben. We also want this one.
The dish came out. It looked exactly as you would imagine. Ben ate a piece. Then it was my turn. We have video evidence. I know I said, try it, but you dont need to try that one. I did it for you. Youre welcome.

Those are the names, ages, places and dates of death of seven women who were violently murdered while walking home, jogging, hiking or taking a birthday trip this year.
Of all the news that has filtered across my phone screen while Ive been bouncing around the world, none had the potential to throw me into a paralytic spiral more than reading about a woman killed simply because she was alone.
Was there ever a time you felt unsafe? a friend asked me recently. The answer was no, not like I have been in the past, when I escaped attackers in my Williamsburg, Brooklyn, neighborhood or on a trip to France; and also, Always.
Caution as a solo female traveler is healthy; blind fear is not. I find that for me the best system is to always remember that I am a tourist. Its good to know what people who live in a place have to say about safety, but also realize that the rules that apply to them, who know where they are going, and can blend in, dont apply to me.
Ive had to sacrifice areas of coverage I might otherwise enjoy, like night life, because I didnt feel safe going out alone. For the one destination that was all about going out, in Belgrade, Serbia, I hired a translator-guide to keep me company, who became a fast friend. In Bogotá, I met a young female professor through Instagram who took me out with her friends for a night.
Theres a literal extra cost to being a woman traveling on your own. In cities where safety seemed like it might be an issue, I took cabs and Ubers rather than cheaper public transport. Climbing up certain mountains or going around certain cities, I opted for a guide, and often paid extra because most private tours have a two-person minimum.
At one point, I got delayed arriving at an Airbnb Id booked in Glasgow, and had to retrieve the key, after midnight, from a lockbox attached to a fence on a dark side street. A man, clearly on something, swayed back and forth about 20 feet away, as I fumbled with the combination while also trying to keep an eye on my bags. When I got inside, the apartment was lovely, but the building looked like it had been through a bombing and never recovered. Certain landings, including mine, had no lights, and glass covered the floor from broken windows. I was hanging out with a local travel writer who usually walked me home at night, but if he hadnt been there, no one would have known my whereabouts.
After that I vowed to stay only in hotels with 24-hour front desks rather than rental apartments. 
The idea of dating in a strange land quickly went out the window I didnt have time and it didnt seem safe. But I didnt swear off romantic leanings entirely. All told I had four make-out sessions all year, all in public or under what felt like very safe circumstances. Those seem like little miracles.
Oh, the stories of strangers that I could tell.
In Montgomery, there was Marcus, an Uber driver whod grown up in what he described as abject poverty, who gave me an inspired lecture on his citys complicated racial history. We picked up his neighbor, a nurse, from work, as he does every night, and finished with a feast at Applebees.
In Puerto Rico, there was Blandine, a travel agent whod greeted me dancing and singing by the baggage carousel, a few months after Hurricane Maria, when much of the country was without power. A farmer, Elmer Sánchez, mentioned a party to me and my friend, and we showed up to find at least 400 people dancing to the best musicians in the country playing by the light of a generator.
In Ypres, Belgium, there were the countless people attending the Last Post Ceremony, to honor the missing fallen Commonwealth soldiers of World War I, who told me the stories of their valiant, dead relatives, and ripped my heart in two.
In Matera, Italy, there were Cosimo, Angelica, Mariangela, Alessandro and Marcello, who introduced me to possibly the worlds most delicious food, panzerotto (fried dough with cheese and tomato sauce), and made me feel like I was family, even with my rusty Italian.
In Kigali, Rwanda, there was M.A., now a surrogate sister, and her entire family, who hosted me at a birthday gathering two days after I met them, while also sharing their stories of surviving genocide.
Whats the biggest lesson youve learned? is a question I often get. I always answer, That people are fundamentally good around the world.
Solo travel is an experience Id urge every human, and particularly every woman, to try at least once. Youll find that while you might physically be without people you know, youre rarely alone. I had a device in my pocket that allowed me to call home, and to post a picture on an app that opened up conversations with strangers who just seemed to want to wish me well.
While in Patagonia, I spent four hours climbing a volcano in the rain by myself, to reach a desolate summit with nothing but burned trees and ashen pebbles. Out of the freezing cold mist came a hooded figure. Hablas español o ingles? I asked. English, he told me. He was a vegan punk-rock drummer from Berlin who liked to laugh a lot and pet stray dogs, and we ended up traveling together for the next five days.
My parents were my rocks through the ups and the downs. Weekly phone calls with my therapist were among the best work I did. Certain friends became lifelines. There was Heidi Vogt, with her endless logistical know-how; Jean Lee, an expert on Korea and also on how to pack for any eventuality; Chiwan Choi, a poet friend who kept me clearheaded on writing; Marie Ternes, who talked me through story ideas even two days before having her first child.
For the past week, Ive stayed put in my 52nd place, the small town of Kep on the Cambodian Coast. The plan was to spend the holidays alone in this tranquil, piece of heaven on the beach, banging out my final articles.
Then I got an Instagram DM from an acquaintance from Los Angeles. She had seen a photo Id posted from Kep, and it was a strange coincidence, but she and a girlfriend would be there the next day. Then I got another message from Ben, who lives in Bangkok. He and his girlfriend, Zoe, were trying to figure out one last vacation to take before they moved to New York. Would I recommend Kep? Within 10 minutes he sent me his hotel booking and flight information.
The next morning, I befriended a British family at my hotel and we got along so well we went on a sunset cruise together. 
The posse grew with each new arrival. Wed feast on crabs and then head to a bar to play cards until the owner kicked us out. It was a magical holiday, and in it I could see glimpses of the future, of being surrounded by found family, content in each others company, of traveling solo but never being, or desiring to be, truly alone.
Whats next? I dont know. I might be physically going back to the apartment I left behind in Brooklyn 12 months ago, but the center of my life isnt there for me anymore. Its with me and its mobile.

"* Winter storm warning for western Montgomery, Frederick and Loudoun counties | Flood watch through this evening | School closings and delays | Storm news | Our favorite photos * Its been a long winter, and it hasnt even started. Im kidding. Sort of. The first snow is always fun, at least until it makes a mess and/or turns to rain and slop. Were in phase two at this point locally. Lots of slop to deal with, and this part of the current winter storm is peaking through the evening. Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options Through Tonight: Well continue to see patches of moderate to occasionally heavy precipitation into the evening. Overall, we are seeing activity transition from a solid shield to more showery in nature, or waves of precipitation. This is primarily rain, but there is some freezing rain in north and west suburbs where temperatures are still at or below freezing. Some precipitation may still be locally intense at times, but it also becomes increasingly hit-or-miss into the night. It could turn back over to sleet and snow as the storm pulls away after midnight and toward sunrise, particularly across northern Maryland. Any additional accumulation would be minor. Temperatures dont go far from where they are now, with lows mostly in the near 30 to mid-30s zone. Some refreeze is a concern, especially north and west. (more on that below) View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Friday): Its breezy behind the noreaster, but sunshine should return as well. With those rays comes temperatures plenty warm enough to finish off much of the melting process except in places it really piled up. Highs aim for the mid-and-upper 40s under partly sunny skies. Those winds are out of the north around 10 mph. See David Streits forecast through the beginning of next week. And if you havent already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Refreeze: Temperatures probably wont fall much from where they are now, but there is some risk for iciness to develop overnight. given they remain near freezing in parts of the area. If your area remains at or below freezing this evening, this is especially targeted at you. As CWGs Jason Samenow indicated in the last main storm update, temperatures heading into sunset remained near and below freezing west of Poolesville and Sterling, and north of Gaithersburg and Columbia. In addition to seeing some freezing rain in the short term, these are the same general areas which are likely to see the most in the way of refreeze overnight.

"NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities on Tuesday as investors anticipated strong demand for $78 billion of new issues on sale later in the day and data showing U.S. consumer confidence at its lowest since July 2017. 
Good results from the $162 billion in new debt offered Monday pushed up expectations for that afternoon’s $32 billion sale of seven-year notes. Yields fell, with the biggest loss on the seven-year, which was down two basis points at 2.63 percent. 
The flood of supply coincides with signs that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may pause the central bank’s gradual interest rate increases after U.S. economic data came in softer than expected in December and investors were whipped around by financial markets. Strong demand for U.S. debt indicates the market believes that rates will not be raised, at least in the short term. 
In considering the strong performance on Monday compared to weaker debt auctions the previous month, “we suspect the commencement of the Fed’s pause to begin the New Year is the primary fundamental impetus,” wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. 
“The prospect of an extended hiking respite and worries on dimming growth seem to have underpinned solid primary market appetite.” 
A group of bidders, which included bond dealers and large fund managers, purchased their largest share of five-year notes since July 2014 on Monday, U.S. Treasury Department data showed. 
Also on Monday, indirect bidders, including fund managers and most foreign central banks, purchased their biggest share of two-year note supply in a year. 
Yields were also dragged lower following data showing that an index of U.S. consumer confidence was at its lowest since July 2017. 
The Federal Reserve begins its monthly two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, with no change expected to rates. Chair Jerome Powell will give a news conference after every monthly meeting this year beginning Wednesday. 
Later this week, investors will be watching the release of several important economic data reports, some of which had been delayed by the record five-week partial U.S. government shutdown that ended this weekend. 
Employment data for December will be published on Friday and is expected to show the shutdown’s impact. 
The benchmark 10-year yield was down 1.6 basis points, last at 2.73 percent. The two-year yield, which reflects market expectations of rate hikes was down 1.4 basis points, last at 2.58 percent.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The number of jobs in the U.S. solar industry dropped by 3.2 percent in 2018, a second year of losses, as the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign panels and state-level policy changes hit demand for installations, according to an industry report released on Tuesday. 
The job losses reflect how changing trade and environmental policies can alter the trajectory of an industry that was among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. energy industry. 
The number of solar energy workers fell by 8,000 to 242,000 in 2018, according to the Solar Jobs Census, released annually by the non-profit research firm The Solar Foundation, following a loss of 10,000 jobs in 2017. But jobs are expected to rise next year, the report said. 
In early 2018, President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels to boost domestic manufacturing, the opening salvo in what has become a wide-ranging trade war. The move led developers to cancel or freeze billions of dollars of investments in large-installation projects because most of the solar panels used in the United States are made abroad. 
On the manufacturing side, there is little evidence so far of a boost. Jobs in the industry’s manufacturing sector - a small slice of the overall industry - fell 8 percent in 2018, according to the report. 
Policies of U.S. states are also critical to solar growth, and changes in incentives and rates for projects in large markets led to job losses there, according to the report. 
In California, utility procurement slowed because power companies have fulfilled near-term renewable energy procurement requirements. The state’s commercial market also slowed due to a shift to rates that are less favorable to solar. In Massachusetts, the commercial market stalled ahead of the introduction of a new incentive scheme at the end of the year. 
The Solar Foundation said it expects a rebound in jobs of 7 percent next year, however, due to recent declines in solar panel prices that have made them more affordable. 
China last year slashed subsidies for solar installations, unleashing a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the international market and pushing prices below what they were before the tariffs were imposed. 
Installation will receive the biggest bump, more than 9 percent, the report said, while manufacturing will rise 4 percent, the report said. 
JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, Hanwha Q CELLS, and some others are opening U.S. factories to avoid U.S. tariffs.

NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury bond prices rose on Monday, sinking yields, after $162 billion of new debt sold to strong demand. 
The flood of supply, issued to pay for President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and fiscal policies, was bought up despite the crowded auction schedule and an expected pause in Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The U.S. government sold $81 billion in short-dated bills, $40 billion of two-year notes and $41 billion of five-year notes on Monday afternoon. 
“These are very good results considering how much supply we have to bid on. Further out on the curve may be a bit more challenging. As long as the market believes the Fed has its back, the supply should sell well,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president, fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson. 
A group of bidders, which includes bond dealers and large fund managers, purchased their largest share of five-year notes since July 2014, U.S. Treasury Department data showed. 
Indirect bidders, including fund managers and most foreign central banks, purchased their biggest share of two-year note supply in a year, rebounding from a weak auction a month ago. 
An additional $78 billion will be sold on Tuesday. 
The latest wave of issuance coincides with signals that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may pause the central bank’s gradual increases in interest rates after U.S. economic data came in softer than expected in December and investors were whipped around by volatile financial markets. 
Two-year bond yields, which are used as a proxy for market expectations of interest rate hikes, fell about half a basis point, and were last at 2.59 percent. 
“The two-year (auction) went very well. And that tells me that the short end is scaling back expectations for Fed tightening,” said Hurley. 
Yields had also fallen earlier in the day in step with U.S. stocks, which dropped as the trade war with China hit corporate earnings from Caterpillar Inc and fourth-quarter guidance from Nvidia Corp. 
Later this week, investors will be watching the release of several important economic data reports, some of which had been delayed by the record five-week partial U.S. government shutdown that ended this weekend. Employment data for December will be published on Friday, and is expected to show the shutdown’s impact.

"April 3 (Reuters) - Severe flooding in the U.S. Midwest this season has had ripple effects for drivers further west, as washed-out rail lines disrupted ethanol supply, causing spikes in gasoline prices and even forcing some retail stations to shut down. 
Ethanol producers in flood-ravaged states have had trouble getting their product to markets over the past two weeks, as rail lines have been shut or hampered by rising waters. Separately, a spate of refinery outages in California has tightened fuel supplies, contributing to higher prices. 
Recent outages included Valero Energy Corp’s controlled shutdown of its Benicia, California refinery and Phillips 66’s planned maintenance work at its Los Angeles refinery. 
Most U.S. gasoline includes roughly 10 percent corn-based ethanol as required by federal law. Ethanol also often serves a cheap octane booster and shortages in the biofuel can force blenders that supply retail stations to cut or halt operations. 
Most U.S. ethanol is produced in the Midwest corn-belt states. Rail lines get the product to coastal markets. 
States such as California and Arizona have been especially hit by gasoline and ethanol supply disruptions, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy. 
The average price in both states has risen faster than the national average in the last month, according to American Automobile Association data. Both Arizona and the national average for a regular gallon of gasoline was $2.42 a month ago; Arizona is now at $2.78, while the country is at $2.70. 
“You have the rising price of gasoline because of constrained supply, and the same thing with ethanol. That’s creating an environment where you’re getting a double-whammy of supply issues on both sides,” DeHaan said. 
The floods forced Midwest ethanol production to fall by some 13 to 15 percent, traders told Reuters, leaving blenders and retail gasoline racks short on ethanol. 
“It’s been a real mess, with ethanol shortages hitting regions, then a unit train comes and it’s okay. But then the next day, another shortage pops up,” one ethanol trader said. 
Ethanol futures on the Chicago Board of Trade spiked in mid-February to $1.43 per gallon, a six-month high. They have pared gains since then and last traded at $1.31 per gallon on Wednesday. 
The RBOB futures contract on NYMEX traded at $1.9512 a gallon on Wednesday.

The Nikkei share average ended 0.2 percent higher to 21,802.59. 
The Nikkei was trading in negative territory earlier but it turned slightly positive thanks to a rally in cyclical stocks as recent strong Chinese economic data has supported sentiment, traders said. 
They still expected the index to stay in a rangebound as investors wanted more clarity on the state of U.S.-China trade talks and remained cautious ahead a flood of corporate earnings. “The Nikkei has risen to a level where it needs more positive catalysts from companies’ earnings,” said Shogo Maekawa, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Companies need to show growth stories to convince investors that the Japanese market deserves further gains.” 
On Thursday, Yaskawa Electric will start this month’s parade of earning reports for the year ended March 31. The automation equipment maker, whose shares gained 1.8 percent, is closely followed because it has large exposure to China. 
The broader Topix shed 0.1 percent to 1,618.76, with defensive sectors such as utilities, real estate and construction underperforming.

"NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ahead of auctions of $162 billion in new issues, Treasury bond yields recovered on Monday morning after falling earlier in step with U.S. stocks as the trade war with China hit corporate earnings from Caterpillar Inc and fourth-quarter guidance from Nvidia Corp. 
Treasury yields are expected to rise further ahead of Monday’s auctions. The U.S. government will sell $81 billion in short-dated bills, $40 billion of two-year notes and $41 billion of five-year notes. An additional $78 billion will be sold on Tuesday. 
Bond issuance has increased steadily since 2018 to fund President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and spending increases. The latest flood of supply coincides with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaling that the central bank may pause its gradual increases in interest rates after U.S. economic data came in softer-than-expected in December and volatile financial markets whipped investors around. 
Not all market participants were concerned that the increased supply, alongside expectations of a Fed pause, would decrease demand. Bond yields increase with interest rates, with the two-year yield used as a proxy for market sentiment about interest rate hikes. 
“Today’s two-year supply will offer an update on primary market demand for Treasuries as Powell’s pause gets underway,” said Benjamin Jeffrey, trading products analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “While on an outright basis two-year yields are well off their cycle highs set late last year, within the context of this new, lower range, two-years look cheaper than they have for most of 2019.” 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 302 points, or 1.22 percent and the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 1.02 percent, down 27.2 points in mid-morning trade. A fall in riskier assets pushes money into safe havens such as U.S. government bonds, driving up prices and lowering yields. 
Caterpillar reported quarterly profit that widely missed Wall Street estimates, hurt by softening demand in China, a strong dollar, and higher manufacturing and freight costs, sending shares tumbling around 8.7 percent. 
Also on Monday morning, Nvidia announced it had cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars due to weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected datacenter sales, sending its shares sliding 15.5 percent. 
The benchmark 10-year yield was down half a basis point last at 2.75 percent, with the 30-year yield down a basis point at 3.05 percent. The two-year yield was up less than half a basis point, last at 2.60 percent.

"March 7 (Reuters) - Most emerging market stocks fell on Thursday, with Chinese blue-chips losing steam, while developing world currencies broadly held course as they awaited cues on the pace of global growth from the European Central Bank’s meeting. 
China’s finance minister reiterated the country would not seek to flood the economy with stimulus, tempering hopes of further support to the world’s second largest economy and sending blue-chip stocks on the mainland 1 percent lower. 
A 0.6 percent fall for MSCI’s emerging markets stock index ended its four day winning run, while MSCI’s developing market currencies index was a shade lower. The ECB is expected to slash growth forecasts and give its strongest signal yet that fresh stimulus is coming in the form of more cheap loans, known more formally as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). 
“Global risk sentiments may take a backseat today, as market players await the ECB policy decision,” wrote OCBC Bank analysts in a note, adding market speculation was now revolving around a fresh TLTRO round. 
Fears of global growth being continually bogged down by the U.S.-China trade war have sent investors fleeing from riskier assets to safer bets in the developed world over the past months. 
A cut in global growth forecasts by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development rattled risk appetite further. 
South African shares fell 0.3 percent and their Russian peers lost half a percent on Thursday, while those in Turkey managed to eke out a 0.3 percent gain. 
South Africa’s rand weakened 0.3 percent, while Russia’s rouble fell marginally. 
Turkey’s lira dipped 0.2 percent, set to extend losses to an eighth straight session, which would be its longest losing streak since November 2016. 
The country’s central bank matched market expectations on Wednesday by leaving interest rates unchanged, adding it would tighten monetary policy further if needed. 
The stance soothed investor worries that it could loosen policy after inflation fell from a 15-year peak. 
Emerging European currencies weakened against a slightly firmer euro, with Poland’s zloty a touch softer after the local central bank kept its key rate unchanged on Wednesday. 
A package of social spending and tax cuts in Poland does not raise the chance of interest rate increases in 2019 and 2020, the central bank governor said after the decision.

"In Washingtons super soggy 2018, a rainy Election Day morning seemed only fitting. What were initially forecast to be light showers morphed into heavy downpours, soaking voters as they ventured out to the polls. Another brief round of showers, and possibly some thunderstorms, are likely in the afternoon between around 2:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. from west to east. Especially in our east and southeast suburbs, a few storms could generate strong winds. Rain should clear the region between 4 and 6 p.m. So heading to the polls late may be your best bet if you wish to stay dry. Afternoon rain/storm outlook Showers are likely to linger in the region through noon followed by a pause in the rain. Its possible skies brighten a bit before a final round of showers and storms comes through in the middle of the afternoon. A convective line may develop along the cold front and sweep through D.C., with heavy showers but not much lightning and thunder, said Jeff Halverson, Capital Weather Gangs severe weather expert, in an email. The latest forecast models show the line developing between 2 and 3 p.m. in Washingtons western suburbs, sweeping across the Beltway around 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. and then entering the Chesapeake Bay around 5 p.m. These showers and storms, while gusty, should be brief, lasting less than 45 minutes in most locations. The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has placed Washingtons east and southeast suburbs in a zone of marginal to slight risk of severe storms, where damaging winds are possible. The greater chance for any severe storms increases from northwest to southeast across the D.C. region, Halverson said. ""Very strong winds aloft mean there is a chance of isolated damaging wind gusts and tornadoes but that threat is greatest southeast of the District, where the air mass will be more unstable. The morning rain Through the morning, driving rain doused the droves waiting in line to vote. Light drizzle when I went to vote at 7:15 am in MoCo, tweeted Pat Ryan Garcia. Ridiculously heavy downpour by the time I left. Worst Election Day weather I can remember. Washington has received 0.67 inches of rain so far today (through 11 a.m.), pushing its 2018 rainfall total to 55.78 inches, the most on record year-to-date (ahead of 1889s 55.43 inches). With 55 days still left in 2018, this amount ranks as the sixth-highest calendar year total on record, and more rain is possible today and again Friday. Enough rain fell in east-central Prince Georges County to trigger a flood warning, which remains in effect through 1:45 p.m. Western Branch in Upper Marlboro, and other streams in the area, are still at high levels from Mondays rainfall, and flooding is likely later this morning, potentially into the afternoon, the National Weather Service wrote.","Isolated storms could produce damaging wind gusts, mostly east and southeast of Interstate 95.",2018-11-06T16:38:05Z,"After a morning soaking on Election Day, more showers and maybe a gusty thunderstorm this afternoon",The Washington Post,0

"Vehicles are seen piled up on a street after a flash flood in the southern city of Shiraz, Iran, March 25, 2019.
AP
Tehran, March -- The death toll from major floods swamping much of Iran has risen to 21, emergency services said Tuesday, as authorities sent safety warnings to mobile telephones across the country. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message of condolence urging officials to speed up relief efforts and compensation for victims of the floods, which the authorities described as unprecedented.
The disaster, which the energy minister blamed on climate change, struck in the middle of Iranian New Year holidays, with many relief workers on vacation.
Nineteen people were killed and 98 injured in the southern city of Shiraz, while one person died in the western province of Kermanshah and another in Lorestan, also in the west, rescue services said.
At least 110 people were reported wounded, according to the health ministry.
Dramatic video posted to social media showed fast-moving water dragging piles of vehicles down streets that had become rivers. Some of the vehicles being swept away still had people clinging to them or trying to escape. One video, posted on Monday, showed several people struggling to cling to a lamp pole on a flooded roadway before losing their grip and being pulled away by the water.

With 20 of Iran's 31 provinces experiencing floods or facing an imminent threat, the country's National Crisis Management Committee was activated at the cabinet level.
Iran's meteorological service has warned of more heavy showers until Wednesday, and flood warnings have gone out for central provinces such as Isfahan and the capital Tehran.
Overnight the crisis management committee sent out multiple text messages to all mobile telephones in Iran urging people to be cautious and await instructions from official sources.
""Remain calm when facing possible dangers... do not honk your car horns in mountainous regions as it might cause avalanches,"" one of the messages read.
""Do not setup tents near rivers or mountainous areas... and most importantly do not cross bridges when floods are running underneath,"" read another one.
The floods followed extreme rainfall which at times was equivalent to half of the average annual levels within 24 hours.
It follows major floods on March 19 in the northeastern provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran, for which no official casualty toll has been given.
Such a widespread flood threat is unprecedented in arid Iran, which until 2018 was dealing with decades of drought.
""Climate change is forcing itself on our country,"" said Energy Minister Reza Ardekanian, who is in charge of dams and water supply.
""These unprecedented floods in our country are because of climate change worldwide,"" he said on Monday, quoted by the Tasnim news agency.","Energy minister in normally arid nation says ""unprecedented floods in our country are because of climate change""",2019-03-26T14:27:21Z,"Flash flooding ravages Iran, leaving at least 21 dead",CBS News,1

"The Mid-Atlantic ski season so far is best described by one step forward, two steps back, with snow one day and 60-degree rain the next. Late last week, the region got a shot of cold air behind a low pressure system that dropped up to 9 inches of powder in the high-country resorts. It also allowed front-range slopes to make piles of man-made snow.
Ski resort operators were stoked because the holiday season is one of the busiest times of the year, and shredders were gleeful for their favorite gift. Thats all changed now as the temperatures in the mountains are currently in the 50s and some 60s and its been raining hard since last night.
Dave Lesher, who manages the weather station at Canaan Heights, W.Va., which sits at 3,715 feet wrote this morning, Cloudy overnight with a soaking rain beginning shortly after midnight, ending before daybreak. Snow cover sharply reduced. Thats bad news especially for our cross-country friends who frequent Whitegrass Touring Center in Canaan Valley, where there is only a paper-thin snow cover left to slide on.
In good news, Liberty, Whitetail and Roundtop have opened, but it will be interesting to see how all of the resorts hold on to their snowpack in the coming days. Currently most everybody is reporting wet and granular conditions with some resorts opting out of grooming as a snow survival strategy. Timberline, W.Va., reported icy conditions Friday. And the poor Homestead has still not mustered enough snow-making to open for the season.
If you are headed to the mountains this afternoon be advised there is a flood watch in effect until Saturday morning for Massanutten, Wintergreen and Snowshoe. Expect a cool down Saturday, which will allow for some snow-making into Sunday. Its possible several areas may even get scattered flurries. But temperatures rise again by Monday and more liquid returns for New Years Day; so pack your rain gear and make some time to hang around the fire in the lodge to stay warm and dry.

"COLUMBUS, Neb./CHICAGO (Reuters) - Nebraska grain farmer Ryan Ueberrhein was barely breaking even after the U.S.-China trade war pushed prices for his soybean crop to a decade low. Then the nearby Elkhorn River burst its banks as flooding swept across the U.S. farm belt. 
Uberrhein’s farm was left covered in debris after the roiling water receded. He has mounting debts. And he is worried that President Donald Trump may not be able to strike a trade deal with China that would end tariffs on U.S. soybean exports - and allow him to sell whatever grain is left intact at a better price. 
Frustration is building across farm country at what feels like a never-ending season of bad news. 
The trade war “keeps damaging us,” said Ueberrhein, 34, of Valley, Nebraska, who voted for Trump. “What the president is doing, we stand by him, but ... we can’t keep getting hit just because a deal can’t be made quickly.” 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to arrive in China this week for another round of trade talks with their Chinese counterparts. The two sides have yet to agree on many core issues. 
Farmers who spoke to Reuters remained supportive of Trump. 
Soybean exports to China hit a four-year low in February because of the trade war. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, which are the largest single U.S. agricultural export. A near halt in exports has hit a rural economy already struggling after years of oversupply cut farm incomes by 50 percent in the past five years. 
Debt in the agrarian economy has hit levels last seen during the U.S. farm collapse of the 1980s. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2TkUDjk) 
The Nebraska Rural Response Hotline, which provides support to farmers and ranchers, has received a record number of calls about financial distress, said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. Calls about suicide and depression were up, too, he said. 
The latest piece of bad news came on March 11, when the Trump administration released its 2020 budget and proposed a 15 percent cut for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, calling its subsidies to farmers “overly generous.” 
It did not matter to farmers, who helped vote Trump into office, that the budget will not pass muster with Democrats who control the House of Representatives, Hansen said. Some farmers took the proposed cut to subsidies for crop insurance as an insult. 
“How many times do you have to kick us when we’re down?” he said. 
That insurance is crucial to Richard Oswald, who farms near Phelps City, Missouri. The flood has already swallowed his childhood home, many of his fields and more than 20,000 bushels of corn. His four grain bins have burst, after water-logged corn expanded and split open. 
“If our government and leaders can’t step up and start to lead, we’re done for,” he said. 
For years, Oswald paid extra for flood insurance. He hoped that government talk of investing in improving U.S. infrastructure would come through - and bolster the levees and dams throughout the Midwest. 
But this year, as the trade war dragged on, he dropped the policy to reduce expenses. So he will get no insurance money for the lost corn, Oswald said. 
A few days ago, one of his lenders called. Oswald didn’t have to pay the loan right away, the lender said, but he would have to repay it sooner or later. 
“Help needs to come from Congress, but Congress is so divided, I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Oswald said. 
DISASTER DECLARATION 
Trump approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska on Thursday, making federal funding available in nine counties that bore the brunt of the recent floods. On Saturday, he approved one for flood-affected counties in Iowa. 
Greg Ibach, a USDA under secretary, is touring the damage in Nebraska, and Bill Northey, another under secretary, will head to Iowa, agency officials told Reuters. 
U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said the farm belt states would need more aid, suggesting a separate relief bill to offer compensation to farmers for livestock killed in the floods and grains in storage that will have to be destroyed. 
“The United States government has always been the insurance of last resort,” Grassley said in a phone interview on Friday. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts put agricultural flood damage for the state at nearly $1 billion. Iowa officials are projecting losses of at least $1.6 billion, with at least $214 million in damage to the agriculture sector. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said her state would need assistance beyond what is granted through disaster declarations. 
Farmers, meanwhile, are staring at waterlogged fields and expecting more floods. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the flooding would worsen in coming weeks as snow on the ground melts and water flows downstream. 
Iowa farmer Dave Newby said the standing water in his fields was already threatening his planned start to corn in mid-to-late April. Newby, like many farmers, had been looking to boost his corn plantings this year because such a large volume of soybeans had been left unsold because of the trade war. 
The same was the case in nearby Nebraska. Parts of flooded farmland remained under water and farmers had yet to assess the damage the piled-up sand, silt and debris caused to soil. Almost all said planting will likely be delayed, which could lead to lower yields. 
 “Normal planting would take place around May 1, but I doubt we will make it,” said Kendal Sock, a cattle and corn farmer in Genoa. “I wish they’d get this trade deal done, like now.”

Several winter storms are expected to hit large areas of the country with a mix of snow, heavy winds and rain over the next few days as they roll from coast to coast.
Almost 15 million people in parts of northern and southern California, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, are under a flash flood watch, according to forecasters. 16 million people in northern and central parts of the state are under a wind alert.
The National Weather Service predicts wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour in some parts of the Bay Area and warned residents to expect strong winds that could blow down limbs, trees, and power lines. Scattered power outages are also expected Wednesday and Thursday, weather analysts said.

Elsewhere in California, forecasters are predicting storms to dump up to seven feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains. AccuWeather said that storm is expected to hit on Wednesday.
There is also a significant risk of mudslides due to weather conditions Wednesday night and into Thursday morning, forecasters said. Things are expected to calm down by Thursday evening.
The Midwest and Northeast are also in for messy weather. Forecasters said two storm systems will move through parts of those regions over the next several days, bringing snow to places such as Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York City and Washington, D.C.
Blizzard conditions are expected for the Midwest Friday night and into Saturday, forecasters said, adding that it will be a fast-moving storm.
Indianapolis will see snow beginning Thursday morning before it switches to rain by that afternoon, weather forecasters said.
Snow may cause a slight headache for commuters traveling home from work Thursday evening in Pittsburgh but by Friday morning residents are expected to wake up to light rain or snow, according to weather analysts.
In New York City, snow is expected to begin to fall early Friday morning and end that afternoon. Chicago will see snow coming down much of the day Saturday, forecasters said.
Things will begin to settle down by Sunday afternoon, analysts predicted. However, Boston will see some snow early Sunday morning before it tapers off later that night.

"North Carolina was blanketed with too much snow too soon: more than a foot in several areas and winter had barely just arrived. Years' worth of snowfall swept through parts of the state in a little more than a day, causing hundreds of crashes, thousands of power outages and at least two confirmed deaths, officials said Monday. Double-digit snowfall totals dropped in many cities and towns over the weekend, far higher than what the state normally sees this time of year. In one county, five families was stranded while 20 inches of snow buried the area. By Monday, much of the snow has dissipated, but the state which is still recovering from the damage wrought by Hurricane Florence in the summer is not out of the woods yet. A deadly mix of ice and rain will keep roads treacherous, and many could turn into ice rinks overnight, Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference. [ Southern storm dumps historic amounts of snow in Mid-Atlantic: Heres how much fell ] Most of North Carolina has gotten through the worst of the storm, but we need to stay vigilant... The snow and ice and the danger may not go away as quickly as they came, Cooper (D) said. Even the parts of our state that didnt see a flake may feel effects from the storm today, he said. Coastal communities are under flood warnings, and water may wash over parts of Highway 12, which connects the Outer Bankss barrier islands. Cooper issued a state of emergency Friday, and the deluge began Saturday. Just after 4 p.m. Saturday, a tree fell on a moving vehicle in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews. The vehicle crashed into a nearby church. The driver died, while the passenger suffered minor injuries, police said. In Haywood County in eastern North Carolina, a woman in hospice care died in her home, Cooper said. No other details were immediately available. In the eastern city of Kinston, a truck drifted off the road and into a river. Divers have recovered the trucks cab, but the driver has not been found, officials said. [ Winter storm hits parts of Georgia, Carolinas and Virginia, causing power outages and treacherous travel ] In Wilkes County, five families about 20 people, including small children were stranded in their homes. The families had been without power for three days and could not get out after their neighborhoods were buried in more than 20 inches of snow, said Lt. Col. Matt Devivo of the North Carolina National Guard. A team of guardsmen drove on impassable roads and rescued the families, who have since been taken to a shelter. More than 600 collisions have been reported, and about 144,000 households remain without power as of Monday morning. Much of the winters snow in North Carolina usually falls in January and February. Among the worst snowstorms on record happened in January 2000, when Raleigh was buried in more than 20 inches of snow. The winter storm hit other parts of the Southeast, too, including South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia.

"If it seems as if Houston is getting wetter, youre not imagining things. The nations fourth-largest city found itself under multiple flash flood warnings on Friday night as an early winter storm doused Harris County with up to a half-foot of rain. Houstons George Bush Intercontinental Airport picked up 4.7 inches from the storm, 4.31 of which fell on Friday alone. The neighboring suburb of El Lago saw 6.56 inches within 24 hours. Thats Houstons single-greatest one-day rain total since Hurricane Harvey struck in August last year. Friday was also the second-wettest December day on record at the airport, where bookkeeping dates to 1969. In one day, more rain came down than is normal for the entire month in Houston, where the average December total is 3.74 inches. Its all part of a startling trend that bears the fingerprint of climate change. Since 1970, Houston has warmed 3.5 degrees. The most dramatic warming has been in the late summer and fall. Now consider that each degree Celsius the air heats up means that the atmosphere can contain about 7 percent more water. Scientists call that the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. By this metric, the roughly 1.9 degree Celsius warming that Houston has seen should correspond to a 10 to 15 percent increase in rainfall. Thats just theory, though. So what does the historical data show? Between 1970 and 2017, Houstons mean annual rainfall jumped from 47 inches to near 53. Thats a six-inch increase in 47 years or the equivalent of 12 percent more rain each year. Harveys rainfall last year may have spiked the trend upward, so its important to compensate for that. By the same token, droughts like the one in 2011 in which Houston fell two feet behind on rainfall can have the opposite effect. For that reason, we can remove outliers in the data that obscure any long-term trends. More than 85 percent of the years since 1969 in Houston have seen between 30 and 70 inches of rain. Thats a window of 20 inches on either side of the normal annual rainfall of about 50. Four years saw more, and three years less. Axing the data from those years paints a more accurate picture of whats happening. The results are similar showing a roughly 4.4 inch increase in average yearly rainfall since 1970. There are no two ways about it. Houston is trending wetter, and the warming climate is very likely to be the leading cause. Its not just the day-to-day rainfall thats increasing. High-end rainstorms are becoming markedly more common. Of the top 100 rainiest days since 1970 in Houston, 54 have occurred since 2000. Moreover, these top-tier rainy days are twice as common in the 2000-2017 period compared with the 1970-1999 interval. Houston has seen five rainstorms with more than 4 inches in the past year and a half. Assuming these trends do not slow or reverse, the city is likely to deal with even more severe challenges from heavy rainfall in the future.","Since 1970, Houston's average yearly rainfall has ticked up from 47 inches to about 53.",2018-12-10T18:24:30Z,Houston’s latest deluge fits into alarming trend toward more extreme rainfall,The Washington Post,0
"The United States was hit by a barrage of wild weather over the weekend. Tornadoes carved through the South, a blizzard buried the northern plains, and flash floods drenched the Tennessee Valley. But amid the busy weekend, the United States also was struck by something you might not be expecting at this time of the year: a typhoon. 
The U.S. territory of Guam was sideswiped by the beastly storm Wutip on Saturday. It was whirling Monday morning about 300 miles west of the Mariana Islands with 150 mph sustained winds coiled tightly around its foreboding eye. The Category 4-equivalent typhoon is packing gusts topping 180 mph. Early Monday, it peaked at Category 5-equivalent strength, making it the strongest February typhoon on record.
Its also the longest-lived February typhoon on record and the first February super typhoon in more than a century.
The powerhouse storm is like an atmospheric whirlpool, vacuuming air up and out its center. The storms barometric pressure fell to 915 millibars 27.02 inches the air pressure if you climbed to the height of two Empire State buildings.
February typhoons are incredibly unusual. The last such storm to skirt Guam was Irma in 1953. That one dropped 7.88 inches of rain in 24 hours. The island dodged a bullet again this time, as the Guam Daily Post reports that no serious damage or injury occurred.
But it was a wet storm, with 4.21 inches of rain at Guams Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport Saturday, triggering a rare flash flood warning and setting a rainfall record for the date.
There was some flash flooding on the southeastern part of the island, said Mike Middlebrooke, senior forecaster at the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Inaranjan had some issues and picked up more than a foot. 
An automated sensor in the town of Inaranjan recorded 16.9 inches over the weekend its highest two-day rain total on record. Despite the hefty totals, Middlebrook said it could have been worse, adding, we were just on the fringe of this storm. 
There is a silver lining: Guam desperately needs the rain. Scant rainfall in recent weeks has made water planning an issue for the Mariana Islands, including Guam. A statement by the National Weather Service on Feb. 11 painted a drought-stricken picture, stating residents should plan for drier conditions over the next several weeks and perhaps months. 
Middlebrook said: We were close to the point of having to issue fire weather watches. The rain was probably beneficial. 
The Mariana Islands are no stranger to typhoons. Four months ago, Super Typhoon Yutu ravaged Saipan, eerily swallowing the island in its eye after lashing it with sustained 180 mph winds. It became the second-strongest hurricane to make landfall on U.S. soil.
Tinian [an island just southwest of Saipan] was flattened, Middlebrooke said. I was watching it on satellite that night. Ill tell you what its horrible to be helpless and watching something like that as its about to hit people. But theyre doing okay now. 
This time around, no land masses look to be in harms way as Wutip continues to harmlessly churn over open waters. The Joint Typhoon Warming Center estimates it will slowly weaken, remaining at or above hurricane-equivalent strength through midweek before dissipating into a tropical depression on Thursday well southeast of Taiwan.",Guam was sideswiped by a beastly storm – Wutip.

"Vice President Pence will survey the widespread destruction across the Midwest on Tuesday, following historic flooding that has killed at least four people, leveled bridges and submerged huge swaths of the region with bone-chilling floodwaters.
Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin have declared states of emergency after the most powerful late-winter storm in a decade unleashed torrents of rain that melted snow, overtaking rivers and levees in powerful surges.
While floodwaters remain steady in some areas and recede in others, some regions are bracing for more floods to come as rivers vault toward their crest this week and the next, CNN reported.
Nebraska was struck particularly hard; three of the four fatalities occurred in the state. Two-thirds of its 94 counties and four tribal areas declared states of emergency.
It was the most extensive damage our state has ever experienced, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) said Monday.
Farmers and ranchers are expecting at least $800 million in losses of livestock and crops, the Omaha World-Herald reported.
[These images reveal the historic and horrific flooding in Nebraska and nearby states]
Some farmers were marshaled to use heavy equipment for recovery and rescue efforts, with at least one tragic outcome.
James Wilke, a farmer in Platte County, sped to a person trapped in a car.
With the guidance of emergency responders, James drove his tractor over the Shell Creek bridge on the Monestary Road and the bridge gave out. James and the tractor went down into the floodwater below, family friend Jodi L. Hefti wrote on Facebook, according to CNN.
Betty Hamernik, 80, also of Platte County, died after she was trapped in her home by rising floodwater. Aleido Rojas Galan died of his injuries in Lincoln after being rescued in Iowa, and another man was killed by raging waters that overtook a dam in Spencer, CNN reported.
It just looked like the end of the world coming, Niobrara, Neb., Mayor Jody Stark told the Omaha World-Herald.
The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services warned that dirty floodwaters may have contaminated private wells.
A bomb cyclone a hurricane-like winter storm battered the region with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The resulting flooding was particularly intense, because the heavy rain fell on snow that had not melted yet, said Brian Barjenbruch, the science and operations officer for the Weather Service in Omaha.
Barjenbruch said the results have been incredibly damaging in parts of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.
It is some of the worst flooding that weve seen in many years, Barjenbruch said of those areas. In some locations, its the worst flooding on record on many of these river gauges.
Recovery efforts will soon begin in areas where floodwaters recede and reveal the extent of devastation across the region, though it is unclear when that may occur. The 2011 floodwaters that washed away parts of Plattsmouth, Neb., did not retreat for 3 ½ months.

"Californians knew for a while that an atmospheric river was coming in the latter half of this week. But that was about all that was certain, at least until just before it arrived.
A two-day north-south combo punch turned out to be a soaker and it hit almost everywhere.
From Wednesday to Thursday, the river in the sky packed an astoundingly waterlogged wallop.
Combined with a pair of low-pressure systems sliding down from the Gulf of Alaska, it dumped more than a foot of snow on the startled north Central Valley city of Redding, the most there in more than 50 years.
The next day, Palomar Observatory, located on a mountaintop 60-plus miles north-northeast of San Diego, took in 10.1 inches of rain its wettest day ever recorded. Palm Springs posted 3.68 inches, its wettest February day on record and the third heaviest 24-hour rainfall in any month.
In between came report after report of washed-out and flooded roads and highways.
Thankfully for California, it did not suffer intensive flooding caused by rain melting away the deep snowpack accumulated over this wet winter. At Lake Oroville, site of that scary spillway failure two years ago, the reservoir was taking in 66,000 cubic feet per second, yet there was plenty of capacity for this inflow.
Meanwhile, social media was awash in videos and footage of flood-control infrastructure from neighborhood retention ponds to the concrete channel cutting past Angel Stadium of Anaheim doing its collective job by keeping water out of harms way.
Nevertheless, thats not to say California escaped unscathed.
Late Thursday, possible flooding on the Sacramento River prompted the Butte County Sheriffs Office to issue an evacuation order near Chico. Also, there were several water rescues due to motorists getting caught in rising floodwaters.
But the Californian with the worst experience of the AR might have been the 70-year-old woman in Sausalito, on San Francisco Bay just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, who had a mudslide crash into her house and a neighbors. Over 2.5 inches of rain fell in the San Francisco area.
According to the days-old Ralph Scale, which measures the strength of AR events, this was a Category 3 strong. Notably, the scale which factors intensity and duration knocked down the rating from a Cat 4 (extreme) in Northern California because of a lower-intensity IVT and in Southern California because passed through in less than 24 hours.
The forecasting models picked up on this event early, focusing on a Kona low swinging into place, ready to turn on the tap for the West Coast. If that wasnt convincing, there were impressive satellite photos (We see you, newest GOES West! Better late than never!) and reports from a storm-battered Hawaii.
But until just hours before that tropical moisture began streaming across the state, those same forecasting models couldnt reach consensus on how the AR would interface phase, in the technical term with the two storm systems swooping down from the north. The tone of meteorologists forecasts ranged from frustration to ¯\_()_/¯.
The states wet winter doesnt appear to be coming to an end anytime soon. Late Thursday, another storm was dragging a squall line across Northern California, while two more low-pressure systems from the north were expected to arrive Friday and Sunday. But the latter pair dont have the subtropical moisture to tap into, and so arent expected to make much noise.

"Following a predominantly wet second half of 2018 and the same for many places in the first three months of 2019 the Lower 48 is moving into spring with very few regions in drought conditions.
Over the past week, there was no extreme or exceptional drought across the contiguous United States for the first time since the U.S. Drought Monitor began logging data in 2000. Only a few years come close to what were seeing right now, including 2009, 2010 and 2017, all shown below on drought maps but 2019 appears to be the lowest drought level in more than 19 years.
Drought Monitors scale runs from zero to 5, with one being the first true level of drought.
In addition to the total lack of the high-level drought areas, zones of severe drought (2 or greater) are at a low point for the past two decades. With Thursdays update, only 0.88 percent of the contiguous U.S. is under a severe (2) drought. Thats up slightly from last weeks 0.86 percent, but it remains lower than any year prior in the Drought Monitor data.
When it comes to total coverage of no drought, this week is the second-highest at around 80 percent, trailing only a period in May into June of 2017, when up to 85 percent of the country was drought-free.
While areas of no drought ticked down slightly from last week, drought-free locations remain at an exceptional 79.37 percent of the contiguous United States. Thats down from a peak of 81.65 percent last week, but quite a reversal from summer 2012, when less than 20 percent of the Lower 48 was drought-free.
Prior to this year or 2017, to find other recent times with comparatively little drought of any category across the Lower 48, we need to look back to the summer of 2010 and the fall of 2009. Like this year, that was an El Niño winter and spring, which are known for producing wet conditions in much of the country.
Although not included in the stats here, its also worth noting that parts of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico are also under moderate drought. Drought in southeast Alaska has been tied to the persistently warm readings there lately. In Hawaii, it has been something of a cooler than normal winter with north winds and drier air dominating. Puerto Rico has witnessed plenty of sunny days lately, thanks to a high pressure anchored off the southeast coast in recent weeks and months, which has helped pump moisture into the eastern U.S. at the same time.
We never like to talk about extreme drought, so this is all good news. But theres another side to the coin. Flooding has already been a major issue this spring in places like Nebraska as well as neighbors in the Midwest and in areas farther south or east. With an El Niño persisting through spring, NOAA continues to warn of an unprecedented spring flood season.
While experts believe drought may expand further in parts of the Pacific northwest over coming months, no other drought development areas are noted at present. Instead, additional drought removal is expected in parts of the four corners and Texas.",About 80 percent of the country is drought-free.,2019-04-04T16:51:42Z,The area in extreme drought is smallest in nearly 20 years — but there’s a flip side,The Washington Post,0

"Mother Nature cant make up her mind in the Midwest and Northeast, where a number of locations have set record-high temperatures just days after a powerful polar blast brought a rash of record lows.
The lobe of the polar vortex, which carried punishing cold air into the Midwest and Northeast Wednesday through Friday, swiftly retreated over the weekend, and a surge of unseasonably mild air took its place.
The magnitude of the thaw has been remarkable and, in some places, record-challenging.
Wednesday, the temperature at Chicagos OHare International Airport plummeted to a staggering minus-23, climbing to just minus-10 in the afternoon. It was the citys second coldest day in recorded history. The minus-23 was the coldest since 1985.
Fast forward to Sunday. The low temperature only sank to 39 degrees, the warmest for Feb. 3 on record and a 62-degree swing from Wednesday.
Another fun Chicago fact--yesterday's low of 39° was a daily record warm low, set just a few days after consecutive daily record cold lows on Jan 30-31 (-23° and -21° respectively). Here's a look at Chicago's hourly temps in the last week (via https://t.co/hhHNtNPrp3) pic.twitter.com/0lNDxc2o4G
— Radiant Solutions | Weather Desk (@Radiant_Weather) February 4, 2019
On Monday, Chicagos temperature raced up into the low 50s. Considering the wind chill in Chicago crashed to minus-50 on Wednesday, the city witnessed a 100-degree swing in the feels-like temperature in five days.
Chicagos not alone in its remarkable temperature turnaround. Nearby Rockford, Ill., shattered its record low, plummeting to minus-31 on Thursday. The previous record of minus-27 had stood for nearly four decades. Just four days later, on Sunday, the low in Rockford didnt drop below 37 degrees., a record for the date and was a 68-degree swing.
Buffalo was home to another wild fluctuation. It set a record low on Friday of minus-4. Then on Sunday, it set a record high, peaking at a balmy 54 degrees.
While the short-fused spike in temperatures has been impressive in many areas, La Crosse, Wis. might take the cake. Its temperature soared 73 degrees in three days. The National Weather Service office serving the region tweeted that it was the greatest 72-hour leap in temperature since 1951. Thursday morning saw a low of minus-33, before a maximum of 40 on Groundhog Day.
The brief warm-up coincided with Punxsutawney Phils cheerful announcement of an early spring, but make no mistake the springlike weather will not last. A cold front will knock temperatures into the 20s from the Twin Cities and Chicago south to the Interstate 70 corridor Monday night with a stronger cold front to follow late in the week.
Officials fear the rapid freeze-thaw cycle will result in burst pipes, potholes, as well as ice jams and floods. Numerous rivers in northern Illinois were under flood advisories and warnings Monday due to the ice-jam threat.
In addition, melting has led to above-average groundwater in a large swath of the nations middle. The rapid drop in the mercury will lead to quick freezing of water near the surface, resulting in expansion and possible frostquakes. 
These earthquake-like rattlings of the ground are the product of fresh snowmelt or rainwater entering shallow cracks in the ground. When the temperatures plummet swiftly, trapped water becomes ice and expands. That imparts stress on chunks of soil, building until giving way in an abrupt jolt and boom.
Above-average groundwater in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri should help to trigger some frost quakes. Residents in the eastern Corn Belt may experience a few of these so-called cryoseisms in the next 36 hours.

"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) A nearly $3 million grant would allow 14 homeowners in the South Bend area to sell their flood-damaged properties to St. Joseph County.
The South Bend Tribune reports Sunday that the county plans to demolish the Jewell Woods-area homes if it receives the Federal Emergency Management Agency funding.
Rainfall and flooding over the past few years have caused a ditch to overflow, damaging homes in the low-elevated neighborhood just south of South Bend.
Officials say demolishing the homes would make the neighborhood less vulnerable to flooding during storms because more water would flow into open green spaces.
Homeowners would have the right to reject offers from the county which would need to cover a quarter of the grant.
The grant proposal also calls for buying one flood-damaged home in Mishawaka.

"The forecast for Seattle on Monday was for about one to two inches of snow. Instead, 6.1 inches pasted the city, perhaps no surprise during a ten-day stretch which has become historic.
The half-foot of snow pushed Februarys total to 20.2 inches, Seattles snowiest month in 50 years. Its the 7th snowiest month dating back to 1895 and the fourth snowiest since records have been kept at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SeaTac).
Were probably ready to wave the white flag of surrender, only itd likely get lost in the sea of snow, quipped KOMO-TV Meteorologist Scott Sistek.
Mondays snowstorm brought a new round of power outages and travel woes to the region. At least 90.000 customers lost power and more than 400 flights were canceled at SeaTac. Traffic remains snarled, with some roads closed due to the snow and fallen trees.
The latest round of snow was heavy and wet, with unusually high water content packed into it.
In a typical snowfall, the water content in 10 inches of snow is equivalent to an inch of rain. But for this pasty snowfall, the Weather Service office in Seattle reported there was the equivalent of an inch of water embedded within three inches of snow.
The combined weight of the snow from previous storms and Mondays cement-like dump proved too much for many trees, which fell in large numbers.
The heft of the snow also increased the risk for roof collapses. The roof of an outbuilding for a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Shoreline collapsed, injuring two people. Other roof collapses were reported around Tacoma.
As temperatures rose above freezing in much of the area, and the snow changed to rain, the latest concern has become flooding.
A flood warning for small streams and urban areas was issued Tuesday morning and high water closed some roads in and around Seattle.
What comes next
Theres still no guaranteed end in sight to the cold and snowy pattern in the Pacific Northwest.
Another storm system is slated to move toward the region later this week. While the Weather Service forecast for Seattle currently calls for more rain than snow, the new system is taking a path that is similar to recent snowstorms.
Beyond the risk for more snow, it also appears to want to stay colder than normal in the region for the foreseeable future. Forecasts and weather models suggest below normal temperatures should continue for the next one to two weeks.
Given all these wintry factors, it seems likely that additional white flags of surrender will be waved in the time ahead.
Februarys snowfall in perspective
Thanks to Mondays snowfall, the snowiest February on record at Seattle-Tacoma became a good deal snowier. It hopped past four more months into fourth place for any month of the year at that location.
The 20.2 inches of snow so far this February is the most recorded there since 45.4 inches fell in January 1969. This is of course way beyond the average February snowfall of 1.7 inches.
It was also the second six-inch-plus snowstorm of the month. Getting two snow events that large in one month is a rarity for the city. According to Weather Service office serving Seattle, Feb. 2019 becomes the fifth month on record to accomplish this.",More than 20 inches have fallen in less than 10 days.,2019-02-12T17:24:55Z,"Monday’s snow beat expectations in Seattle, and this month is now its snowiest in 50 years",The Washington Post,1
"Marathon Monday is less than a week away in Boston, but that doesnt mean Mother Nature is cooperating. Models have consistently hinted at a cruel combination of wind, rain and unseasonable chill to haunt the races 30,000 runners.
The energy responsible for spawning the soaking storm is more than 1,500 miles southwest of Kodiak, Alaska, near the international date line in the North Pacific. It will move onshore the Pacific Northwest toward the end of the workweek before diving south, lashing parts of the Mid-South with renewed heavy rains and a flood threat. From there, the storm tracks up the Tennessee Valley, bringing strong to severe storms over Dixie Alley and the Deep South Sunday, and targeting the Northeast with its meteorological melancholy on Monday.
Timing is everything. The storm looks to bring Beantown its worst between sunrise and noon. The first batch of marathon runners departs Hopkinton at 9:02 a.m., with the remaining participants setting off in waves through 11:15 a.m. A chilly rain is possible and, if downpours develop, a half to three quarters of an inch of water could fall by early afternoon.
As the race is still six days away, however, the specifics of this forecast could change.
The official forecast is calling for temperatures around 50 degrees, though its likely an easterly wind off the water coupled with cold air draining down from the north could knock Boston back into the lower to mid-40s.
Periods of mist and drizzle may persist into the late afternoon, with even an outside shot of brief snow in the higher elevations of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and the Berkshires.
The atmosphere can be fickle this time of year in southern New England. On Monday, New York City warmed to 78, while Hartford a mere 100 miles away held steady at 43 degrees.
Past Boston Marathons have seen all sorts of wild weather. In 2017, Logan Airport peaked at a balmy 75 degrees just a day after a record setting 86 degrees. But in 2015, temperatures struggled to hit 50, and 0.61 inches of rain fell. And if youre looking for variety, try 2014 the race began in the 30s, flirting with 70 in the afternoon.
Eric Fisher is the chief meteorologist at WBZ-TV in Boston, and has run the marathon a number of times. He says the rain predicted to drench this years race could be dangerous to runners.
Heavy rain like last year can be tough, he said in a message. There were quite a few cases of hypothermia on the course.
If the rain clears out sooner though, that could be good news for runners. Most athletes would prefer a cooler day over the summerlike weather thats baked the course in years past.
After a winter of cold training, the ideal day [for runners] is mostly cloudy and somewhere close to 50 degrees, wrote Fisher. Thats actually a pretty standard day for Boston in mid-April. The average high this time of year is around 56 or 57 degrees.
But thats not always ideal for spectators, he concedes:

"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) At least 30 Afghan villagers searching for gold in a riverbed perished on Sunday in a flash flood in northeastern Badakhshan province, provincial officials said.
Along with those killed, dozens were also injured as a landslide and flash flood engulfed the river in the morning in Kohistan district, an area about 110 kilometers (68 miles), from Fayzabad, the capital of Badakhshan.
Nek Mohammad Nazari, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said the villagers had dug deep in the river, which had in the past been mined for gold, when they were caught in the flash flood. The casualty numbers could rise, he said.
The victims were villagers who were mining for gold illegally, according to the official. ""Rescue teams have been dispatched to the area to help in recovering the bodies,"" Nazari said.
Sanaullah Rohani, spokesman for the police chief in Badakhshan, said seven of the injured were in critical condition. According to Rohani, there were about 50 people illegally looking for gold at the time of the landslide.
Fawzia Kofi, a lawmaker form Badakhshan, gave a higher death toll for the tragedy, saying that 40 villagers were killed.
Afghanistan is a mountainous, land-locked nation that has huge, largely untouched reserves of copper, iron ore, chromite, mercury, zinc, gems, including rubies and emeralds, as well as gold and silver.
Mines are scattered across different provinces of the country, but still the government has not been able to achieve investments in this important sector or establish a thriving extraction industry.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) The Latest on a Southern California storm that raised flood fears in burn areas (all times local): 10:30 p.m. Authorities are keeping a worried eye on fire-scarred hillsides in Southern California after a storm brought flooding fears and prompted evacuation orders for hundreds of homes. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for Los Angeles-adjacent counties ravaged by a summer wildfire. Evacuation orders remain in place Friday for Trabuco Canyon in Orange County and for several neighborhoods in the Lake Elsinore area east of Los Angeles. Other Elsinore areas had the mandatory evacuations downgraded to voluntary evacuation warnings as the storm eased. Forecasters say it will be warmer and drier before another storm moves in next week. Thursday's storm brought record-breaking rainfall to downtown Los Angeles, jammed major roads with mud, rain or snow and sent a landing airliner skidding off a runway.

"For months, President Trump has toyed with the idea of declaring the southern border a national emergency, thereby securing some of the money he needs to build a wall.
Now that Congress has reached a deal, and Trump didnt get anywhere near the amount of money he demanded, it looks like hes going to do just that.
But what exactly makes something an emergency?
We could look at statistics and tell you that the amount of undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border is the lowest that it has been in a decade and that more people actually cross illegally into the country from Canada. We could mention that theres no evidence of terrorists hitching a ride on caravans to sneak in with Latin American asylum seekers.
We could look at the law, but theres no official definition of a national emergency.
So instead well just turn to the dictionary.
Merriam-Webster defines emergency this way:
1: an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action
2: an urgent need for assistance or relief
Ex: the mayor declared a state of emergency after the flood
Lets break that down, shall we.
1. Is the situation at the border unforeseen? 
Well, no. Trump has been talking about the crisis of illegal immigration since he announced his candidacy in June 2015.
2. Does it require immediate action?
Many conservatives, like Ann Coulter, would argue yes, but so far no immediate action has been taken. Trump has been president for just over two years. In that time, Republicans controlled Congress and they did not do anything about the border.
3. Is it an urgent need? 
See above
Not convinced? Lets try another source. Heres Dictionary.com:
1. A sudden, urgent, usually unexpected occurrence or occasion requiring immediate action
The situation at the border is not sudden, urgent or unexpected.
Whether the U.S.-Mexico border constitutes an emergency could end up being decided by the courts. If they go by the dictionary definition, its going to be a hard sell for the White House.
Because, as Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote last month, Presidents dont dawdle in the face of real emergencies.","What's happening at the border is not urgent, sudden or unexpected.",2019-02-15T00:43:46Z,Can the border really be called an ‘emergency’?

"CHICO, Calif. (AP) People have scoured evacuation centers, called 911 and posted desperate online pleas for help finding relatives they haven't heard from since a fast-moving wildfire devastated a Northern California town. A day after tens of thousands evacuated the town of Paradise and the nearby community of Magalia, dozens of people, many of them elderly, remained unaccounted for. Anguished relatives flooded social media asking for help locating their loved ones. Cherri Rolla's family hasn't heard from her 83-year-old aunt, Sylvia Johnson, who lives in Paradise with at least six dogs and three horses. Rolla says a grandson living nearby saw Johnson on Thursday and tried to get her to leave, but she refused. ""When he went back, they wouldn't let him in,"" said Rolla, who lives of North Dakota. ""The hardest part is to be so far away and not figure out what we're going to try to do to find her."" On Friday, they got a call that a woman at a church in Oroville may be Johnson. ""We don't have 100 percent confirmation that it's her,"" Rolla said. ""I'm trying not to get too terribly excited."" Social media sites were filled with gut-wrenching pleas for help, including one from the relatives of Jean Forsman. Diane Forsman, who lives in New Hampshire, said her 83-year-old mother can't walk on her own and relies on oxygen. Her caretaker wasn't able to reach her Thursday morning when the fire swept through Magalia. ""It's terrifying,"" Diane Forsman said by telephone. ""We're trying to remain hopeful until we get word. We don't know what the outcome will be."" She and her brother posted on social media to see if anyone had seen her. They tried calling 911 and other numbers. They were told officials had a list of 300 to 400 welfare checks to do. Finally, they got word through Facebook on Friday morning that someone in her neighborhood had picked up a woman with disabilities. But the Forsmans haven't been able to confirm yet whether it's their mom. Many of the missing are seniors without cellphones or social media accounts who had moved to the Northern California area that's known as a refuge for retirees. ""Paradise, unfortunately, is just one of those (places) there's a lot of elderly, a lot of immobile people, some low income with no vehicles,"" Chico police Officer John Barker said. The missing included Richard Wayne Johnson and his wife, Suzanne Johnson, who live in an RV park in Paradise that is believed to have burned, said his daughter Dawn Johnson of Independence, Oregon. ""He has Stage 4 prostate cancer, she's in her 70s and mostly confined to her bed due to fibromyalgia,"" Dawn Johnson said. The couple moved from Texas to the California foothill town about a year ago and were probably not prepared to evacuate in a wildfire, she said. Johnson hasn't been able to reach them by cellphone, and fellow members of the couple's Jehovah's Witnesses congregation in Paradise told her they have not seem them at shelters. ""I checked all over Red Cross, anything you can think of I've tried to do,"" she said. Families sought help on Twitter from the actor James Woods who began posting and retweeting messages from relatives looking for loved ones using two hashtags he started. Sarah Slate and her family were terrified when it had been more than a day since they heard from her 39-year-old brother, Richard Slate, who has special needs and lives alone. ""All you want to do is cry because you don't have an answer either way,"" said Slate, who lives in central California. ""Not knowing is driving us crazy. You're hoping for the best but in this situation, you're left wondering: 'Is he alive?' By Friday afternoon, Slate said someone had found him, though she didn't know all the details. ""Praise Jesus,"" she said in a text message. Jessica Van Amber, 18, who lives in Magalia but was 15 miles (24 kilometers) away in Chico when the fire broke out, searched several shelters, called friends and appealed to people on social media to help her find her aunt and mom. About 24 hours after she heard they were rushing to flee Magalia, Van Amber posted on Twitter: ""UPDATE: MY MOM HAS BEEN FOUND!!!!!!"" Van Amber said by telephone that she was so relieved they were safe, but ""it doesn't look like there's anything left of our home."" Le reported from Seattle.

"With 3 inches of rain already fallen in the San Francisco Bay Area, a new more powerful storm is approaching the West Coast. Numerous flood, wind and snow alerts have been issued from California to Colorado.
Interested in Weather?
Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
The powerful storm is in the Pacific on Wednesday morning and getting closer to the West Coast -- landfall should be Wednesday afternoon and into Wednesday night.
Very heavy rain is forecast for parts of California, and the threat for mudslides, rockslides and flooding will increase. Powerful winds will accompany the storm, gusting to as high as 100 mph in the mountains.
Snow accumulation will be measured in feet not inches, with some areas in the Sierra Nevada getting almost 6 feet.
A storm western storm is taking aim at the West Coast on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the first in a series of storms that hit the West Coast earlier this week will reach the Midwest Wednesday night and bring some light snow. It will reach the Northeast by Thursday night and deliver a few inches of snow from Philadelphia to New York City and Boston.
At this point, about 1 to 2 inches of snow is possible along Interstate 95 Thursday night, so the Friday morning commute could be slick.
A first storm will move into the Northeast on Friday morning.
The stronger western storm will move into the Midwest on Friday night into Saturday, bringing snow from Oklahoma to Ohio. Several more inches of snow are possible with this storm.
The powerful storm targeting the West Coast on Wednesday will arrive in the Midwest by Saturday.
The storm will move into the Northeast by Saturday night with a mix bag of precipitation in the I-95 corridor.
Heavy snow is expected from Ohio into western Pennsylvania and from upstate New York into New England. Several feet of snow is expected there on Sunday.
The storm will bring heavy snow inland on Sunday morning, but just a mix of precipitation, turning to rain, along the I-95 corridor.
Behind the storm, the coldest air of the season will move into the Midwest and Deep South. There will be wind chills below zero in the Midwest -- and teens into Dallas.
These arctic wind chills move into the Northeast on Monday and Tuesday.
The coldest weather of the year will move into the eastern U.S. on Sunday as the storm exits. Wind chills will be below zero in much of the Midwest and Plains.",About 3 inches of rain fell in the San Francisco Bay area in the past days.,2019-01-16T11:50:41Z,"Heavy rain causing concerns in West, wintry threat to eastern US at end of week",ABC News,0

Freezing rain left roads slippery, cut power to thousands of homes and businesses, and prompted officials to close hundreds of schools in parts of the Midwest on Wednesday, while flooding caused by ice jams prompted evacuations in Michigan and Illinois.
The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory warning of freezing rain, snow and another round of cold weather from Nebraska through Michigan. The warnings also come in the wake of snow, ice and shivering cold hitting normally mild cities in the West. 
School districts including Detroit's were closed Wednesday, as was Wayne State University after residents awoke to a thick coating of ice covering streets, driveways and vehicles. Freezing rain in Kansas and Missouri created icy roadways blamed in two separate crashes that killed three people. The icy conditions prompted officials to cancel classes at dozens of schools in both states.
In mid-Michigan, flooding caused by an ice jam along the Grand River in Portland prompted officials to evacuate about 50 people from homes near the river. Jim Hilligan told the Lansing State Journal that emergency response officials went door-to-door evacuating residents.
""They weren't rushing, but they were like, 'You guys got to get out of your house, the river has broken the banks,'"" Hilligan said.
Major utilities reported more than 50,000 customers were without power early Wednesday in the state, mostly in western Michigan, after freezing rain brought down trees and power lines.
Ice was also breaking up along the Kankakee River in northeastern Illinois, flooding some roads and prompting evacuations. The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning in the area Wednesday morning.
Dangerously low temperatures set in across the Northern Plains, while storms moving into North Dakota and western Minnesota were expected to bring as much as a foot of snow (30.5 centimeters) and wind chills as low as minus 40 (negative 40 Celsius).
Heavy snowfall blanketed states to the West, including Utah, where a winter storm triggered a rare snow day for many students, delayed government operations and snarled morning traffic. Snowfall closed schools and kept snow plow operators busy across northern Arizona early Wednesday, with Flagstaff residents waking up to 9.4 inches of snow (24 centimeters), according to the National Weather Service.
Bitter cold also moved into the Sierra Nevada on Wednesday on the heels of a storm that dropped up to 3 feet (91 centimeters) of snow on the mountains around Lake Tahoe the day before.","Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) The Plains farm aid nonprofit Farm Rescue is launching an effort to bring donated hay to flood-stricken Nebraska ranchers.
North Dakota-based Farm Rescue first activated its ""Operation Hay Lift"" program to help drought-stricken Upper Midwest ranchers in 2017. Dozens of volunteer truckers hauled hundreds of loads of hay to the region.
The organization now wants to do the same for Nebraska ranchers dealing with widespread flooding after a massive late-winter storm, and it's seeking hay donations and volunteer drivers. The Nebraska Farm Bureau says farm and ranch losses in that state could reach $1 billion.
Farm Rescue provides free physical labor for farmers and ranchers dealing with an injury, illness or a natural disaster in six Plains states. It relies on volunteers from around the country, donations and corporate sponsors.

"BEIJING (AP) Huawei Technologies Ltd. showed off a new processor chip for data centers and cloud computing Monday, expanding into new and growing markets despite Western warnings the company might be a security risk.
Huawei and other Chinese technology companies that rely on Western technology are stepping up efforts to develop their own.
The company based in southern Chinas Shenzhen has pushed ahead with commercial initiatives despite the Dec. 1 arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.
Huawei said the Kunpeng 920 chip is designed for servers that handle a flood of data from smartphones, video and other network services a fast growing sector with the development of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The company said it is part of a planned product lineup to support intelligent computing.
Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, is Chinas first global tech competitor and a national champion at the head of an industry the ruling Communist Party is eager to promote. The company says it is employee-owned and rejects accusations by Washington and some other governments that it is controlled by the ruling party and might facilitate spying.
Chinese and U.S. envoys met Monday for talks over a tariff war triggered by American complaints about Beijings technology policies.
The Trump administration, Europe and other trading partners complain initiatives such as Made in China 2025, which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields, violates Beijings market-opening obligations. American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.
The company says its 2018 global sales are forecast to top $100 billion despite curbs imposed on use of its technology by the United States, Australia, Japan and some other governments.
Huawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, has steadily expanded into new industry segments. Its smartphone brand, launched in 2010, passed Apple to become the global No. 2 seller behind Samsung in the third quarter of 2017, according to IDC. The company has developed the Kirin line of chips for its phones and Ascend chips for artificial intelligence.
The Kunpeng 920 chip is based on the ARM system used increasingly in smartphones and distributed computing. It competes in some settings with the x86 standard used by traditional industry leaders Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
Also Monday, Huawei unveiled three servers based on the new chip that are intended for global sale.
Where we see the biggest value for the Kunpeng 920 is in data centers, servers and big data, William Xu, Huaweis chief strategy marketing officer and a member of the company board, said at a news conference in Shenzhen.
Huawei has Chinas biggest corporate research and development budget at $13 billion in 2017.
Those investments have helped to reduce Huaweis reliance on Western technology but its servers, smartphones and other products still use billions of dollars worth of U.S., European, Japanese and other chipsets and other technology.
Executives at Mondays event avoided replying directly when asked whether American security warnings might hurt sales or about concerns U.S.-Chinese rivalry in technology might split the world into separate spheres with their own incompatible standards.
Xu responded to a question about possible industry fragmentation by saying the outlook for the server market is very bright. The general manager of Huaweis server business, Redfox Qiu, added later, in any country or region that we operate, we run our business in strict compliance with local laws and regulations.
Global shipments of Huawei servers grew to 980,000 last year, a twelve-fold increase over 2012, according to Qiu.
Xu tried to play down suggestions the Kunpeng 920 might compete directly with Intel, a major supplier to Huawei.
Intel will remain our most important strategic partner, said Xu. The Kunpeng 920 is definitely not a replacement for Intel processors.

"BARRE, Vt. (AP) Officials in a Vermont city say a flood mitigation project helped break up a potential ice jam that could have clogged up a flood-prone river.
Barre City Manager Steve Mackenzie says the grant-funded flood mitigation project on Gunners Brook prevented several large chunks of ice from clogging up a narrow city channel and potentially causing some flooding.
The Times Argus reports the multifaceted mitigation project removed a bridge that had been a chronic ice choke point in past years installing a pair of ""trash racks"" along a half-mile section of the brook, and excavating an area for flood water and debris to gather without damaging surrounding properties.
Mackenzie says the project passed the latest test with flying colors.

"Adapted from a recent online discussion.
Dear Carolyn: My wife and I have a beach house. When we bought it 12 years ago, we established one firm rule no one could use it when we're not there. And we're very cautious about inviting relatives or friends to stay with us; no one gets invited for more than two days. My wife suggested these rules because she saw how people took advantage of her parents' vacation home when she was growing up, and the rules have served us well. 
My younger sister is getting married soon and she and her fiance have a very limited budget. They've asked to honeymoon at our beach house for a week and I'd like to make an exception for them. My wife is dead-set against it, saying that if we make this one exception, the dam will break and we'll be pestered by everyone. 
I have a very large family who have asked over the years why we're so ""stingy"" with our second home, but I think we can make this one exception and still hold firm with everyone else. My wife disagrees. We're sick of arguing about it so we've both agreed to ask you and stand by your advice.
Beach House Owner
Beach House Owner: Normally Id side with your argument here, because I think gifts are lovely and flexibility is even lovelier; rigid rules and ideologies that allow no room for discretion are my Voldemort.
However: Your very large family has spent years showing zero respect for your boundaries and calling you two stingy! Inexcusable. Your wife sounds rightly concerned that one attempt to be kind would invite a fresh new, years-long cycle of abuse. And it also seems possible, if not probable, that shes already worn to a nub by the 12-year effort to hold firm under rude pressure from your family.
So, Im on Team No.
Unfortunately, your rejecting their request will probably touch off more criticism and pressure anyway. Because, rude.
I bet theres a creative solution available here, though. Would it be worth it, for example, for you and your wife to write a nice check for their honeymoon fund? Do you know anyone else wellll outside the family who owns a vacation home they can use, which you can obtain for them through barter of your home with this other persons? Im just throwing these out as examples and doing so with full knowledge that its not your responsibility to give this couple a honeymoon. I suggest it only because sometimes its worthwhile to buy your way out, principle be damned, of an otherwise no-win situation.
Re: House: I'd rent them another beach house before opening these flood gates. The wife is right about the consequences.

Re: House: Man, that is super stingy.
 Anonymous 2
Anonymous 2: You would think, right? Unless you were in the position of being asked relentlessly and seeing your property treated carelessly. Its a real problem for people with second homes, who often dont say it out loud because they get called stingy and first-world whiny.
So think of it this way: Do you ask other people for their money so you can spend it on yourself? No? Okay then. Thats the same thing as asking to use someones vacation house.

"As he flew aboard Air Force One to an airport hangar rally in Mosinee, Wis., President Trump groused to aides about having to tone down his prepared remarks. Pipe bombs had been mailed to several of his favorite foils, including to the homes of two former presidents and the New York offices of CNN. It was a moment for presidential leadership, less than two weeks before the midterm elections that would deliver a verdict on his first two years in office. But, according to two aides familiar with Trumps objections, the words set to be loaded into the teleprompter didnt match the presidents own plans for closing the campaign, the details of which he had kept from other Republican leaders. He wanted controversy, fury and fear that would push limits and get ratings, paint a caravan of Central American migrants as a mortal threat and color Democrats as their co-conspirators. Now speechwriters were telling the man who encouraged fistfights at his 2016 campaign rallies to call for all sides to come together in peace and harmony. They wanted the real estate promoter who dubbed his Democratic opponent crooked to demand an end to treating political opponents as being morally defective. The midterm elections were always going to come down to a moment like this: President Trump, isolated and imperious, deciding the fate of his Republican Partys electoral hopes. In three short years, he had become an omnipotent force in American life, overturning the customs of the White House, the values of the Republican Party and the rules of public debate. His opponents had reacted fiercely, with the largest street protests since the 1960s and the greatest wave of political engagement as measured by money and volunteer energy that had ever been seen in an off-year election. They were united, as rarely before, against him. But that was just how he liked it, always at the center of attention, going with his gut, selling his defiance as a foundational attribute. He believed in the reactions of his own enormous crowds. They would allow him to defy the prognosticators and polls, show up his media critics, and once again rewrite the rules of American politics. At the White House, a number of senior aides had argued privately that Trumps focus on fanning fears over immigration went too far. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) would call Trump twice in the final weeks to urge him to get off the nonstop immigration talk and refocus on the economy. He argued that Trump should focus on how voters outside the boisterous rallies reacted. Avoid distractions and needless fights, Ryans team argued with White House colleagues. Frame the election as a choice between Republican accomplishment and Democratic rhetoric. [ Conservatives wonder if Trump might leave them in the cold ] Trump would sound like he agreed on the phone, and then veer quickly back to what interested him, while complaining to his own advisers that Ryan, who was leaving office, had allowed too many of his members to retire. Now as Air Force One crossed over Lake Michigan, Trump would once again listen only to himself. He agreed to read the words about unity without abandoning his own strategy of division. To explain the contradiction, he just added a wink and a nod. Do you see how nice Im behaving today? Have you ever seen this? Trump told the crowd, going off script, in a sarcastic aside after calling for harmony. Were all behaving very well. The crowd burst into laughter, providing a nice segue to tease his plans. Wait until you see what were doing with our border over the next two weeks, he said. Our country is assaulted by thousands and thousands of people marching, he said of a group of migrants more than 1,000 miles away. What followed were days of shocks to the political system. The mail-bombing suspect was a Trump booster who had attended his rallies and, authorities said, internalized his name-calling. Three other men suspected of racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist or anti-immigrant delusions allegedly would shoot and kill 15 people in three states over 10 days, at a supermarket, a synagogue and a yoga studio. But Trump stayed the course, consistently raising the temperature of the public debate. He would not make phone calls to the pipe-bomb targets, including former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. He complained about the distraction of domestic terrorism hurting Republicans. For seven days nobody talked about elections, he told a crowd in Columbia, Mo., on Nov. 1. Instead, he rolled out his own news events, without coordinating them with Ryan or the leadership of the National Republican Congressional Committee: new troop deployments to the border, a profane campaign ad that falsely accused Democrats of letting a Mexican cop killer into the country, the threat of answering rock throwers at the border with gunfire by U.S. soldiers, even the claim of a treasonous Democrat-led assault on our sovereignty. Sometimes, he did not coordinate his announcements with his own aides. When the president threatened to undo birthright citizenship with an executive order, Ryan spoke out to defend the Constitution as written, prompting Trump to publicly attack his governing partner. The two men talked by phone later that day. The conversation was short, said three people familiar with the call, and Trump made clear he thought that immigration was still a better message than the economy. It was pure Trump, and it cleared the way for a blow to the presidents governing coalition as Republicans lost the House while keeping firm control of the Senate. Republican losses in the House on Tuesday ran directly through the suburban districts that were most concerned about the presidents divisive behavior, with many races being decided by the thinnest of margins. It was just the latest step in a political realignment a repolarization of politics that began in 2015 with Trumps announcement that he would run for president as a Republican. This account of the battle for power on Capitol Hill is based on more than four dozen interviews with campaign strategists, White House advisers, party officials, government advisers and elected leaders, on both sides of the aisle. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They told the story of a Republican Party battered, emboldened and increasingly redefined. Trump also helped Democrats find a new voice, with a new generation of leaders emerging and a new playbook for winning. The election season began for Dan Sena, the executive director of the Democratic House effort, at a Cracker Barrel in Pennsylvania, where he went to watch diners stream Trumps 2017 inauguration on their phones. There was a woman who was sitting there, he remembered, and she says to her daughter, Were recording this at home. Hes our president. In a blink, Sena saw the challenge. Midterm elections tended to be referendums on the sitting president. Whole parts of the nation, particularly women in well-heeled suburbs, were rejecting Trump. But Sena knew that was not enough, given the way districts were drawn. To win the speakers gavel, Democrats would have to compete for voters who had already forgiven Trump his rule-breaking and liked his policy pitch amid a rising economy. The party would have to break from its instincts, lay off Trump and resist moving left on policy. Sena found himself describing Trump to other Democrats as a godlike figure. Trump held the nations attention in his hands, able to unleash chaos whenever he wanted. I cant control what happens when Donald Trump goes like this to the snow globe, he would say, shaking his hands as if holding one. We knew that to pick up seats in this cycle, we needed a strategy that allowed us to put as many boats into the water, not necessarily waiting on a wave or banking on a wave, but just as many chess pieces on the board as you possibly can. The first step was to come up with a message. A poll by the Democrats House Majority PAC in the summer of 2017 raised alarms: Congressional Republicans scored far higher with working-class whites on issues Democrats believed they should own, such as reducing the power of special interests, rewarding hard work, fighting for people like you. Less than 1 in 4 said Democrats in Congress helped to improve the economy and create jobs, compared with 41 percent who credited Republicans. They were certain that Washington was wholly corrupt, and they were the inevitable losers in that equation, said Jill Normington, the pollster. As the discussions continued, voters kept coming back to the same question: Is there going to be more money in my pocket or less money in my pocket? [ Voters are angry and divided, but still believe in the power of the vote ] Pollsters soon returned with a way for Democrats to claw out of their abyss a broad message focused on fighting GOP plans to raise health-insurance premiums, remove protections for preexisting conditions and cater to special interests. We sort of combined taxes and health care the idea that Republicans were going to cut taxes on insurance companies and they were going to raise premiums on people didnt sit well with people, said Matt Canter of Global Strategy Group, who led focus groups as part of the effort. By the summer of 2018, Democrats had a pocketbook plan that minimized issues like immigration and went after Trump in only a handful of districts where he was deeply unpopular. It was a sharp departure from the Republican strategy in 2010 and 2014 to campaign more directly against Obama. But first Democrats had to find new faces to sell their new message, a task that suddenly appeared far easier than anyone had expected. They were people like Dan McCready, a Marine veteran who had led troops in Iraq before graduating from Harvard Business School. He began talking to an old classmate, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), in the weeks after Trump won. We spent hours on the phone, said Moulton. At one point he told me, Seth, Im 99 percent certain. I just need to know I can be as good a dad as a member of Congress. Moulton told McCready, who would trail in early results in North Carolinas 9th District, that the commute to Washington would not make him a better father. But you werent when you were a Marine, either, Moulton added. You were serving the country. Before long, there were about 20 military-veteran candidates for Congress, including Jason Crow in Colorado, who began trading campaign tips on a private Slack channel organized by Moulton. None identified as liberal crusaders, and most voiced skepticism of the current Democratic leadership. They were joined by a swell of hundreds of female candidates, many of them encouraged by the activist groups that had sprung up in defiance of Trump and in sync with the women in suburban districts who would prove the biggest target of the midterm elections. The rush of new talent with scant political records and more-moderate views was a nightmare for Republicans. Many cut biographical videos for YouTube, filled with military hardware and straight talk, that brought in millions from around the country. M.J. Hegar, a long-shot Democratic candidate in Texas, raised $750,000 in 10 days after posting a three-minute video that went viral. Over the course of the campaign, as the popularity of Trump and Democrats rose and fell, the polling for first-time candidates in the tightest races would hold steady, a sign that they had defined themselves as distinct from the poisonous national conversation that had convulsed the party in earlier campaigns. Republicans had always wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi-style liberals, like they had in the first special election after Trumps win, when Democrat Jon Ossoff had been defeated in Georgia after his supporters were mocked as old San Francisco hippies. But Democrats had learned from that race, and would not make the same mistake. If you get to be seen as a nonpartisan parent of three cute little kids, and before you go to Washington to save the world, you blew up terrorists in the Middle East, you are going to win, griped one Republican election strategist. Pelosi made clear there were no consequences for denouncing her. Just win, baby, became her mantra. Candidates like Kansas Democrat Paul Davis, one of the first to publicly oppose Pelosi, were quietly invited to Washington to receive strategy advice and a pep talk from Pelosi. [ Winners and losers from election night 2018 ] She allowed a large swath of candidates to run against the party without consequence and present themselves as genuine political outsiders, said Andy Surabian, a former White House political adviser who worked for Donald Trump Jr. later in the cycle. Republicans also saw their dream of a socialist rebellion in the Democratic Party fail to materialize. Nominees like New Yorks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made for early targets but quickly became team players. Only one liberal candidate, Kara Eastman in Omaha, won a primary that Democratic strategists believed undermined their chances of winning the seat. In the U.S. Capitol, meanwhile, Democrats moved quickly to diminish the calls for impeachment in their rank and file, and coached candidates away from talking about massive new government programs favored by the Democratic base. Stick with lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks and cleaner government, Pelosi would say, publicly and privately. The health-care issue is dominant its dominant. Behind the scenes, she would speak with more-colorful language about Trump. You cant get in a tinkle contest with a skunk, she told colleagues. You just cant. Members were won over. The message Contain Trump is a stronger political message than Impeach Trump, said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who was one of the first to introduce articles of impeachment for Trump, before deciding he did not want the House to vote on them. Before a Pennsylvania special election in March, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Ryan that would spend $107 million on House broadcast ads, sent a researcher to Pittsburgh for three weeks to find dirt on Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, a Marine veteran who had also served as a federal prosecutor. The effort turned up nothing, a fact that CLFs executive director, Corry Bliss, would later explain to a group of Republicans, including Ryan. So you are saying he is a good person? asked Ryan. Yeah, it sucks, Bliss responded. Republicans, meanwhile, were having less luck in the candidate department. Early in 2018, Republican strategists convened a focus group to screen a positive ad about Rick Saccone, Lambs opponent. Several women in the group reacted with laughter. When asked why, they pointed to the candidates close-cropped mustache. Lamb, who was 26 years younger, looked like a clean- shaven action hero, and he beat Saccone in March by 627 votes, or 0.2 percent, in a district Trump had carried by nearly 20 percentage points. Even before that defeat, the sense of looming disaster had been spreading through the party. Between 1930 and 2016, there had never been more than 27 Republicans retiring from the House in a single election cycle, according to the Brookings Institution. On Tuesdays ballots, 41 Republican-held districts, including Ryans, lacked an incumbent on the ballot, either because of retirement or resignation. Of that group, at least 15 were vulnerable to Democratic takeover, more than half the number Democrats needed to take the majority. Tens of millions of dollars had to be set aside to defend these seats, and in several cases there was little hope. If we had half as many [seats to defend], we would keep the House, predicted one Republican strategist of the retirements. Inside the caucus, years of dysfunction had taken a toll. Leaders had little sway with members, and former committee chairmen had little incentive to stick around. At the White House, political advisers were taken aback as the names started dribbling out. There was no strategy to keep people around, said one person involved in the effort. More often than not, party leaders found that out someone was heading out the door only after the decision had been made. Over at the NRCCs office, staffers could be heard screaming when news broke on Twitter of another key lawmaker throwing in the towel. Other members debating retirement found themselves captive to the new wave of anti-Trump activism sweeping the country, with protesters camped outside their offices. In early 2017, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the NRCC chairman, responded with an all-hands-on-deck effort to stop Republicans from even holding town halls, lest embarrassing video result. Those who insisted on meetings were instructed to follow clear rules: Enter and exit the event separately from voters, bring security, make sure the participants were constituents and try to get questions submitted in advance. In New Jerseys 11th District, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen had been expected to continue his familys Republican dynasty of elected leadership that dated to his states founding. Since 1994, he had never won his Democratic-leaning district by less than 58 percent of the vote, but now the resistance was camped outside his office, with a surprisingly sophisticated operation. We had a full-on research team. We had a data analysis team that was looking at the entire area, said Sally Avelenda, the executive director of NJ11th for Change. We showed up at every farmers market, every town event that wouldnt shut us out. Frelinghuysen complained about Avelendas political work to a board member of her employer, Lakeland Bank. She says a supervisor later warned her that the congressman was a friend of the bank, prompting her to quit her job and go public with the story, which the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee cut into a digital ad. Frelinghuysen called it quits less than a year later, allowing Democrats to pick up the seat with Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor who became an early favorite. Out in California, the weekly rallies against Rep. Darrell Issa (R) grew over the course of 2017 into a sort of street carnival, with a sound system manned by a former musician for Sha Na Na and a retirement cake baked into the shape of a Hawaiian shirt. Ellen Montanari, a corporate consultant who had seen Trumps election as a catastrophe, made sure everyone stayed on message. When one speaker took the microphone to thank Democrats, Montanari grabbed it away, and quickly thanked independents and Republicans as well. I said to her, Dont ever do that again, Montanari remembered. Issa tried to engage, speaking several times at the rallies against him. But in the end his heart was not in it. He decided over Christmas without telling party leaders, paving the way for a likely Democratic pickup. It was really a growing frustration with how the House was operating and the absence of an ability to get things done, said Dale Neugebauer, Issas former chief of staff. With the deck stacked against them, Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) decided their best option was to try to get both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue on the same page. At a Camp David retreat in early January, McCarthy stood before the president to perform his best imitation of a TED Talk, with a slide show of animated charts and graphs. McCarthy explained that the presidents party typically lost more seats in midterm elections than Republicans could afford if they wanted to stay in power. But there were two recent exceptions in 2002 after the attacks of 9/11 and in 1998 after the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when Republicans also overreached by shutting down the government. That second example, McCarthy argued, could provide a model, especially since Democrats were headed toward a shutdown over Trumps decision to end legal protections for migrants who had been brought to the country as children. The key, McCarthy said, would be to minimize losses with ­college-educated women in the suburbs and keep the partisan advantage of Democratic House candidates at less than six points, according to a person familiar with the briefing. He recommended focusing on legislative efforts to curb the ­opioid epidemic and limit human trafficking, along with an aggressive plan to sell the tax cut issues meant to project a sympathetic face to voters outside Trumps base. Notably, the presentation did not focus on immigration, the topic Trump would choose to obsess over in the fall. But for Trump, whose entire brand was anchored in disruption, sticking to a plan based on soothing suburban women was a challenge. At an April tax cut roundtable in West Virginia, he announced that his prepared remarks were a little boring and threw the paper into the air. What followed was a rambling preview of the closing message. He decried birthright citizenship and claimed, without any evidence, that a group of asylum seekers then walking through Mexico included women who had been raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before. GOP strategists watched Trump nervously as the generic ballot polls fluctuated like a stock market ticker, rising and falling with national events and the presidents actions. The failure to repeal Obamacare and the struggles over tax law discouraged Republicans, just as the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh encouraged them. Trumps reaction to the 2017 white-nationalist protests in Charlottesville, the Parkland shooting and the bungled Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin all inflated Democratic energy. House Republican leaders wanted Trump to talk about economic issues. Trump wanted to talk immigration. The president became upset when his campaign produced an ad that focused on economic gains through the eyes of a mother hoping her daughter would succeed, surprising his own political advisers. He repeatedly said that his voters wouldnt come to the polls for the economy, advisers said, and that they did not like Congress. So he ordered the ad to be replaced with a spot focused on the dangers of immigration. He thinks what is good for the base is good for everybody, said one senior Republican official, who noted that issues like crime and national security did not play the same in all competitive districts. You just work around him. At the White House complex, Trumps political team had examined every House and Senate district to see where he could have the most impact. In an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the wall was plastered with details of his 2016 performance. The aides concluded that there was little he could do for some in the House, but substantial sway that he could bring to Senate races by reminding Republicans in rural states why they voted for him. The message matched Trumps own desire, never changing, to be out there on the trail, dominating cable television news. The decision only magnified divisions in the party that Stivers, the NRCC chair, had long struggled to navigate. In early November 2017, weeks after former White House aide Stephen K. Bannon had appeared on 60 Minutes to declare that Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) opposed Trumps populist economic agenda, Stivers met with Bannon at his home base on Capitol Hill. The hope was to form a truce within the party, but the immediate effect was the opposite. Josh Holmes, an adviser to McConnell, was enraged. Fellas this is genuinely hard to believe, he wrote in an email to Ryans staff. Neither House nor Senate leaders had been given advance warning about the meeting. Late in the cycle, as suspected hate crimes came to dominate the news, Stivers became defensive. He had been criticized for a Sunday show appearance in which he defended Republican ads that called out George Soros, the Jewish financier who was often the target of anti-Semitic propaganda. After a story broke about Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) traveling to Austria to meet with representatives of a party with neo-Nazi roots, Stivers announced on Twitter that he strongly condemned Kings behavior without first consulting other Republican leaders. He had a debate scheduled back in his own district that night. It is the NRCCs job to win races, not to be the morality police, said one former NRCC aide. Once you start commenting on one thing, you have to comment on everything. Pressure built throughout the House caucus. Many realized they would have to fend for themselves, without any cover from the president or the national party. Birthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution, so no @realDonaldTrump you cant end it by executive order, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) tweeted after Trump floated the idea. In Colorado, Rep. Mike Coffman (R) would take an even harder public line, announcing that Trumps attempt to demonize migrants as criminals is simply wrong. Coffman was a classic victim of all that had changed about his party the polarization that pulled the suburbs away from Republicans, the rush of anti-Trump enthusiasm among Democrats and the sometimes crossed signals among Republicans desperate to hold the House. He also was a symbol of those crossed signals: On the same day in September that the Congressional Leadership Fund announced that it was pulling $1 million in television advertising out of Coffmans district, the NRCCs independent expenditure arm announced a $600,000 investment, only to pull out of the race weeks later. Candidates like Coffman, a moderate critic of Trump who had long outperformed his party in the Denver suburbs, had another problem: the flood of Democratic spending. In past races, Coffman had invested heavily in digital and cable, where Democrats did not compete, but now even these platforms were filled with ads for his opponent, Jason Crow, a former Army infantry captain who had served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Coffmans campaign staff would gather around the computer every week when ad buys were announced to find out if they would be outspent by 4-fold or, once, even 13-fold on broadcast television. At one point, 16 Democratic groups were attacking him, compared with just three Republican defenders for the cycle. The Democratic plan to expand the map had taken its toll, and Republican strategists in Washington told Coffmans team that they had to cut bait. The general answer was, Look, the map is so freaking big, said Tyler Sandberg, a consultant for Coffman. It was just an onslaught. After winning by eight points in 2016, Coffman was headed for a loss by about the same margin on Tuesday. For Republicans, the money flood felt ubiquitous. Through the beginning of November, Democratic candidates were outspending Republican candidates on broadcast advertising by $173 million to $93 million. The conservative billionaires were chipping in, but they could not compete with ActBlue, the liberal donation-processing company that made it in­cred­ibly simple to convert anger at Trump or the GOP into a $5, $10 or $50 donation on the phone. The platform raised $1.5 billion for liberal candidates and causes during the cycle, nearly twice as much as during the 2016 presidential campaign. Of the 4.7 million small-dollar donors, 63 percent were giving for the first time. Money given directly to candidates could be used to purchase airtime, under the law, at far cheaper rates than paid by outside groups who collected bigger checks. Democratic super PACS, meanwhile, had found new ways of coordinating their efforts. Priorities USA, a group that backed Clinton in 2016, devoted itself to digital advertising, creating a dashboard so that all the liberal efforts could coordinate their purchases on Hulu, YouTube, Facebook and other platforms. House Majority PAC, which coordinated more than $200 million in spending, created a separate clearinghouse that combined polling, online interviews and spending to provide predictions for key House races. The group also expanded the online testing of ads, after being surprised by how many spots actually had a negative effect on the goal. One-third of the ads we tested actually caused backlash, said Jesse Stinebring, a data scientist at Civis Analytics, who worked on the project. Clients were encouraged to test small ad runs before any major buys. By summer, Republicans began to worry that the party was losing the definition battle. Brian Baker, a political strategist for billionaire donors Todd Ricketts and Sheldon Adelson, tested more than a dozen ads to try to paint Democrats as extreme. One focus group began on the day Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) encouraged supporters to harass Republicans in restaurants and department stores. Even the Democratic focus groups were turned off, Baker said. His groups would put $15 million behind a national advertising effort that promoted GOP accomplishments and painted Democrats as a screaming, violent mob of socialists and anarchists who would burn the flag, raise taxes, open the borders and impeach the president. But even this effort was swamped in the final weeks by a billionaire with murkier partisan leanings. After splitting his donations between parties in 2016, Michael Bloomberg would invest more than $115 million of his own money in the Democratic cause, most of it in the final weeks, including about $44 million into the House campaigns. Its a backbreaker in a lot of races, said a second senior Republican official. Without any donors to answer to, Bloomberg went into the most expensive suburban media markets, in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. He also had money to experiment. Howard Wolfson, a former Democratic House strategist who ran the Bloomberg effort, ranked all the districts by educational attainment, in a search for highly educated districts that might have flown under the radar. He then polled for opportunity, eventually deciding to pump nearly $1 million into the suburban Atlanta district of Rep. Rob Woodall (R), who had already been outraised by more than $1 million by his Democratic opponent. Even though he had won by nearly 21 percentage points in 2016, Republicans were forced to scramble for cash to bail him out, only to find donors and strategists resistant, furious that the candidate had done so little to prepare. Woodall, who spent most of the cycle in what Republicans considered a safe seat, held on to a narrow lead with 99 percent of precincts reporting. As a candidate in 2016, Trump always believed that his opponents underestimated the power of grabbing peoples attention. By the time he got to Pensacola, Fla., three days before the elections, he felt he needed to educate his critics. Why doesnt he talk about the economy? Why does he talk about immigration and whats coming up with the caravan? he asked the crowd rhetorically. We can talk about the economy, but the fact is we know how well were doing with the economy and we have to solve problems. His advisers kept trying, anyway. Some continued to tell Trump that he faced both a base motivation problem and a suburban women problem. He only seemed fixated on the former. Even his strategy to bring female aides on stage was less calculated strategy, White House aides said, and more that they were standing beside him before he went out and he thought the crowds would love them. In what seemed intended as a hint, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, told ABC Newss This Week on Sunday that the president was focused on the economy; only the media, she said, focused on immigration. On Monday, the White House placed an opinion piece on Fox Newss website, under the presidents own byline, that contradicted Trumps points on the stump. Vote Republican and continue the jobs boom, the headline said. It was a hallmark of Trumps politics. There was no shame in contradiction, misinformation or vilification. When several companies, including Fox News and Facebook, refused to run a version of his closing campaign ad demonizing immigrants as murderers, he responded breezily to a reporter. A lot of things are offensive, he said. Your questions are offensive. What he was after was attention. You know the midterm elections used to be, like, boring, didnt they? he said at a Monday rally in Cleveland. Now its like the hottest thing. At the White House, aides had already begun to lower expectations for the House. Trumps efforts to awaken the Republican base had been effective in rural areas and in states where Senate Democrats were struggling to stay in office, they argued. There was just no more talk of the red wave Trump had once promised. The final average of public polls showed Democrats had a 10-point advantage, far higher than the six-point benchmark set by McCarthy at Camp David. But Trumps own approval rating had ticked up from its lows, and he appeared to have energized his own voters down the stretch. His fingerprints were all over the Senate contests, where Republicans gained ground in conservative states like North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, while beating back a moderate Democratic challenge in Tennessee. These are NOT red states or Republican states they are Trump states, White House political director Bill Stepien wrote in an internal memo that was leaked before Halloween. It was enough for Trump to declare victory, in a tweet that betrayed no misgivings. Tremendous success tonight, he tweeted as the results came in, ignoring his defeats in the House. Thank you to all!

"TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) Newly released court documents show a Tucson woman told authorities she shot her twin autistic grandsons before she tried kill herself.
Pima County Sheriff's officials say 55-year-old Dorothy Flood remains jailed on suspicion of two counts of first-degree murder.
She's being held on a $250,000 bond and has an April 15 preliminary hearing.
A motive for the slayings remains unclear and authorities believe Flood will try to kill herself again if she's released.
Flood was arrested after 8-year-old Jaden and Jorden Webb were found dead inside a home on Tucson's northwest side last Thursday.
Court records show the boys were shot multiple times.
Authorities found Flood with symptoms of an apparent overdose from taking an unknown quantity of prescription medication.

"Kimberly Krawczyk says she would do anything to keep her students safe. A year ago Thursday, the Parkland, Fla., high school math teacher barricaded students behind her classroom door during one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.
But one of the unconventional responses the local Broward County school district has said could stop another tragedy has left her deeply unnerved: an experimental artificial-intelligence system that would surveil her students closer than ever before.
The South Florida school system, one of the largest in the country, said last month it would install a camera-software system called Avigilon that would allow security officials to track students based on their appearance: With one click, a guard could pull up video of everywhere else a student has been recorded on campus.
The 145-camera system, which administrators said will be installed around the perimeters of the schools deemed at highest risk, will also automatically alert a school-monitoring officer when it senses events that seem out of the ordinary and people in places they are not supposed to be.
The supercharged surveillance network has raised major questions for some students, parents and teachers, like Krawczyk, who voiced concerns about its accuracy, invasiveness and effectiveness. Her biggest doubt: that the technology could ever understand a school campus like a human can.
How is this computer going to make a decision on whats the right and wrong thing in a school with over 3,000 kids? said Krawczyk, a 15-year teacher who was on the third floor of whats known as Marjory Stoneman Douglas High Schools freshman building when the shooting began. We have cameras now every two feet, but you cant get a machine to do everything a human can do. You cant automate the school. What are we turning these schools into?
The specter of student violence is pushing school leaders across the country to turn their campuses into surveillance testing grounds on the hope itll help them detect dangerous people theyd otherwise miss. The supporters and designers of Avigilon, the AI service bought for $1 billion last year by tech giant Motorola Solutions, say its security algorithms could spot risky behavior with superhuman speed and precision, potentially preventing another attack.
But the advanced monitoring technologies ensure the daily lives of American schoolchildren are subjected to close scrutiny from systems that will automatically flag certain students as suspicious, potentially spurring a response from security or police forces, based on the work of algorithms that are hidden from public view.
The camera software has no proven track record for preventing school violence, some technology and civil liberties experts argue. And the testing of their algorithms for bias and accuracy how confident the systems are in identifying possible threats has largely been conducted by the companies themselves.
[Billions are being spent to protect children from school shootings. Does any of it work?]
Elizabeth Laird, a former state education official in Louisiana and the District of Columbia and a current senior fellow at the think tank Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said systems such as Avigilon have faced little public testing for their validity or long-term impact. As they multiply across campuses, she fears they could leave a chilling effect over a place where students are taught to think independently, express themselves and learn from their mistakes.
School officials, she added, often lack the experience or know-how to understand all the data these systems can gather and the potential pitfalls if they get something wrong. Administrators pressured to do something, anything, to increase school security may regard this kind of technology as a cure-all, even when its implications arent entirely understood, she said.
Were seeing that the uses of AI and technology like this are coming with unintended consequences, things the education sector has not experienced before, that may endanger the students it intends to protect, she said. Students could be mischaracterized as dangerous based on how they were dressed or where they were walking, she said. And security officials could be overwhelmed with false alarms, making it harder for them to focus on actual threats.
If the Avigilon contract wins final approval from county leaders in the coming weeks, the school district will spend more than $600,000 in federal and local funds activating the AI-powered system around the high school campuses with the highest security incidents, contracting records show. The camera system will run independently alongside another 10,000 cameras already recording across the countys schools.
Many aspects of the program, however, remain a mystery, and its unclear how exactly the surveillance systems data and performance will be regulated, measured or tested for potential flaws. The school district rejected a Washington Post request to see records relating to the project, including officials communications with the company, citing a broad Florida statute exempting any information related to surveillance systems from public-records law.
[Unproven facial-recognition companies target schools, promising an end to shootings]
No school-security measure has grown more than the use of surveillance cameras, according to survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics, expanding from nearly 20 percent of all public schools in 1999, the year of the Columbine shooting, to over 80 percent in 2015.
But its unclear what effect the cameras have had on mass violence. The number of school shootings every year has remained flat or grown slightly over that period; there were 25 shootings last year, in what was the worst year for mass school violence in at least two decades, a Post analysis found.
Avigilons technology does not use facial-recognition software that can directly match a persons identity to images in a database. Schools and community centers across the country are installing similar software in hopes of flagging or blocking entry to unauthorized visitors.
But in some ways, Avigilon is more powerful, because its appearance search capability allows people to be tracked as long as their body is visible to the camera no facial identification required.
The artificial-intelligence software has been trained on millions of images to comprehend the basic look and movement of people, and its builders say it can now recognize students from afar by their appearance taking into account the shape of their body, their hairstyle, their facial attributes, and the look and color of their clothes.
It then uses those processed images to search through a vast array of other camera footage for other places that person appeared, building a precise timeline of their movement within seconds, a feat thats nearly impossible for a human alone.
The company markets the technology as helping revolutionize public surveillance, transforming video from old evidence, to be looked at after a crime, into a tool that can in the moment think and react on its own. The systems are advertised as hyper-observant, constantly watching and invulnerable to distraction a necessity for watching thousands of video streams, 24 hours a day.
Schools today are monitored by someone sitting in a communications center, looking at a video wall, when the attention span of the average human looking at a single camera and being able to detect events that are useful is about 20 minutes, said Mahesh Saptharishi, the chief technology officer at Motorola Solutions. But when something bad is happening you need to be able in a matter of seconds to figure out where that person is right now.
Motorola, which also makes body cameras and two-way radios, said when it bought Avigilon last year that its AI-powered surveillance systems could help capture a booming market for the military and police.
Avigilon representatives would not say how many schools theyre working in now, but an online list of clients includes hospitals, stadiums, restaurants, and schools across Georgia, Missouri and Tennessee. The company said education is one of Avigilons top markets worldwide.
[A Florida schools answer to campus shootings? Combat veterans with semiautomatic rifles and Glocks.]
Michael Dorn, the executive director of Safe Havens International, a consulting firm that Broward hired to assess its security, said video-analysis systems like Avigilon are becoming increasingly popular among schools seeking to maximize their surveillance capabilities, and security staff use them to watch for students hopping fences, climbing onto roofs or loitering around campus.
But that capacity for widespread monitoring has some students concerned that it could be overused to police students time, movement and activity.
My fear is this will become targeted, said Kenneth Preston, a Broward high school senior who has criticized the districts spending. Maybe Johnny isnt performing exceedingly well, so lets track him to see why. And you dont even have to sit by those cameras to watch him. Its a system that can be abused and will be abused.
The Feb. 14, 2018, shooting in Parkland that left 17 students and school staff dead highlighted devastating flaws in local emergency response. A report commissioned by the state and released last month found that security-system failures had badly hamstrung law-enforcement and medical officials shooting reaction and rescue attempts: Deputies did not have real-time video access, school officials werent trained to play back footage, and first responders mistakenly believed they were watching live video of the shooter when it was on a 20-minute delay.
The report criticized a significant misunderstanding and overapplication of several privacy laws governing student health and education records that it said prevented school officials from more quickly assessing the potential threat. It also urged Florida lawmakers to consider changes to school-privacy laws and invest more thoroughly in surveillance and information-sharing technologies that could potentially fortify the schools against assault.

Lori Alhadeff, who was elected to the Broward school board after her 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was killed during the shooting, said that the school board has not been given a demonstration of Avigilons technology but that she believes the system is worth deploying on any campus where its monitoring capabilities could mean the difference between life and death.
Parents are in the mind-set now, with all these different school shootings, that they want to send their kids to school and know theyll come back home alive, Alhadeff said. Theyll do whatever it takes to make that happen.
But the systems are far from perfect. Avigilons appearance search, a two-year-old feature that would allow a school official to find or highlight people based on what theyre wearing, has an accuracy rate that varies widely depending on factors like lighting and time of year, Saptharishi said. The system would be less accurate, for instance, in wintertime, when students are going to school in heavy coats.
Its unusual motion detection feature is advertised by the company as a way to automatically sense when students are running toward a brawl or away from an attack. But some students wondered just how much the computer could comprehend about the chaos of a typical high school, where frenzied movements and sudden gatherings are an everyday event. One teacher asked whether the system would know the difference between a boyfriend and girlfriend kissing each other and two people about to start a fight.
Saptharishi said the technology is a tool for security staff, not the final decision-maker itself, and that its performance in Broward schools and other early adopters could help further refine the results.
Today I dont know of any quantitative results that clearly show these tools are bar-none effective or bar-none ineffective, Saptharishi said. But he said the company has researched the systems closely and continues to train them, including with data taken from some participating schools. We believe they have a net positive human impact, he said.

The desire for technological solutions to the human problem of school violence has nevertheless emboldened a flood of tech and surveillance start-ups competing for public customers. Schools and other education-related buyers are the fifth-biggest market for surveillance systems across the world but the top market in the United States, with $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017, said Jon Cropley, a senior analyst at the market research firm IHS Markit.
Surveillance-camera algorithms are also increasingly being deployed in unconventional and sometimes unproven ways. The start-up Athena Security, for instance, offers a surveillance-camera software that it says can automatically detect when someone pulls out a gun or knife. The system, trained on a data set of weapon images, is active in a Pennsylvania high school.
Company chief Lisa Falzone said that the system has undergone no independent testing but that internal trials have shown it can be 99 percent accurate. Critics of similar technologies, however, have worried that an inaccuracy alerting when someone pulls out a cellphone instead of a gun could have fatal consequences.
Dorn, the school-security consultant, sees video-analyzing software as an increasingly necessary component of all school surveillance. But he added that it has not been proved to stop mass violence and should be regarded as one tool among many.
There is still no replacement, he added, for the human touch: better training for teachers and deeper relationships between students and staff. But he said he worries that schools growing interest in advanced surveillance techniques could lead to students and parents being deceived about the limits of what the systems can do.
Ive been doing this for 36 years, and Ive never seen as much bad stuff out there in terms of training concepts and gadgets unsound stuff, where theyre just promising stuff folks want to hear, Dorn said.

"FARGO, N.D. (AP) The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has completed its environmental review of a revised Red River diversion project, which will help determine whether the agency will issue a permit for the channel around the flood-prone Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota area. The DNR in October 2016 denied a permit for the original project, leading a federal judge to stop construction that had started southwest of Fargo. The new design by the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority is meant to reduce impacts to land in Richland County in North Dakota and Minnesota's Wilkin County. The DNR is accepting public comments on the environmental review through Nov. 29. The DNR has given mostly favorable reviews to the new project, mainly because fewer acres will be required to hold back water during times of serious flooding. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) The city has spent about $10.5 million to buy 78 homes damaged by June's flash flooding in Des Moines.
The Des Moines Register reports that most of the residences are situated along Fourmile Creek in northeast Des Moines, the area hardest hit. Demolition began this week.
The city used money generated from stormwater utility fees rather than relying on state or federal sources, which can slow the process. City officials have said buying the most flood-prone properties and demolishing the homes reduces the chances of more damage or resident injuries in the future.
The average purchase price of the 78 homes was more than $136,000. The city offers were up to 110 percent of the homes' assessed values.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) Federal Emergency Management Agency officials are scheduled to conduct preliminary damage assessments in 54 Tennessee counties affected by flooding caused by a deluge in February.
The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency says four weather-related deaths have been recorded after heavy rainfall caused flooding of homes, farms and businesses starting Feb. 23.
TEMA says 83 of 95 counties reported flooding damage. Work continues on Interstate 24 in Middle Tennessee and Interstate 40 at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line, after landslides and rockslides blocked those highways.
Preliminary damage assessments by FEMA are scheduled this week. The assessments are part of the process for requesting a major disaster declaration, which could lead to federal assistance.
TEMA says recent rainfall and releases from dams ""are keeping water levels high on rivers and tributaries.""
