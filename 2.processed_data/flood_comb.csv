Authorities warn that Cyclone Owen could still reform offshore on Monday. Severe weather and flood warnings are in place. Owen hit land as a category 3 cyclone at around 03:00 on Saturday (17:00 Friday GMT), 70km (43 miles) from Kowanyama.

The cyclone's 120km/h (74mph) winds weakened as it moved south-east. Queensland's Emergency Service received 400 calls for help over Friday night, according to local outlet News.com. Rescue services are warning that heavy rainfall and flash floods could still follow between now and Tuesday. ""Please do not be complacent, particularly in that northeast tropics area where the rains will continue,"" Queensland Fire and Emergency Services commissioner Katarina Carroll said. The weather system is expected to reach the North Queensland towns of Ingham and Innisfail by early Sunday. Meteorologists predict it will move back out over water before tracking down the state's east coast.

Several Midwestern states are reeling from historic flooding which hit the area a few weeks ago.
Thousands of people have been evacuated, and vast swathes of farmland has been destroyed. 
For many in Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota the recovery effort has been slow and painful, as people return to their homes.
As images of submerged farms were broadcast across the country, many looked for ways to help.
Here are some of the acts of kindness to emerge in the wake of the devastation.
'Any shoes are better than wet shoes'
When Addy Tritt, 25, noticed her local discount shoe shop was closing down she decided to buy out their entire stock.
Ms Tritt then donated the 204 pairs of shoes, valued at $6,000 (£4,555), to families affected by the floods. 
""I wanted them to go to people who actually needed them,"" Ms Tritt told CBS News.
After spending two hours negotiating with the the shop's head office, Ms Tritt paid just $100 (£76) for the entire stock. 
Image copyrightAddy TrittImage caption
 Addy Tritt donated 204 pairs of shoes to Nebraska flood victims
Of Ms Tritt's haul, 162 pairs were baby shoes, two were men's shoes and the rest were women's, according to the the Associated Press.
""Any shoes are better than wet shoes,"" Ms Tritt said. ""If people feel lost, they should try volunteering and donating. It gives me such fulfilment and I want others to feel the way I do.""
The shoes were part of a shipment to Nebraska farmers organised by a local student agricultural group. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said farmers were some of the worst affected by ""the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our state's history"".
'Island hopping in Nebraska!'
With many roads in the region made impassable by floodwater, some volunteers took to the skies to rescue stranded residents. 
Adam Marshall, has been a private pilot for three years, and when he started to receive calls for help from people trapped in the nearby town of Fremont he fired up his small propeller plane. 
Mr Marshall told CNN that he has made more than 30 trips, and described it as ""island hopping in Nebraska"".
""My phone just started blowing up, and I told my wife, 'I think I'm going to be gone for a couple of days'.""
""I transported the entire Midland University dance team to Omaha so they wouldn't miss their commercial flight and a woman named Allie who has five kids and had been cut off from her family,"" he said.
Surrounded by rising floodwaters, Gary Fouraker was rushed to hospital after doctors suspected he had blood clots in his lungs. 
However, there was no room for his wife Marcia to travel with him in the helicopter. 
""I've never been scared like I was [at that point]"", Ms Fouraker told CNN. ""The roads weren't open.""
Mr Marshall came to her rescue, delivering Ms Fouraker to her husband's bedside an hour later. 
""I just really admire the way he, and so many other pilots, have really stepped up to help people,"" Ms Fouraker said.
""Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride,"" Mr Marshall reflected. ""I got a lot of hugs the last few days!""
'I've never escorted hay'
Derek Jilek, from North Dakota, knew he wanted to help when he saw photos of flooded farms across the Midwest. 
He posted on Facebook calling on his ""farm and ranch neighbours"" to donate a few hay bales to those who had been hit by the floods. 
Vast swathes of farmland was destroyed by the floodwater, and many farmers have struggled to feed their livestock.
What started as a small effort to collect donations, turned into a nine truck convoy carrying thousands of dollars worth of farming supplies and equipment. 
""I guess when you're helping or volunteering, I always heard that you do what you know. We know cows and we know trucking, so that's what we did,"" Mr Jilek told local news station WOWT. 
The convoy received a police escort for part of the 600 mile (965km) journey, with a new police department taking over as the trucks crossed county boundaries.
Sgt Dan Kensinger, from the Stark County Sheriff's Department, said, ""This was new to me. We've done funeral escorts and various other things.

 A man injured in the cyclone in Zimbabwe is carried away from a helicopter.
Cyclone Idai, which struck the coastline of Mozambique on 14 March, has caused devastation and heavy loss of life. 
The UN says 1.7 million people in Mozambique lived in the path of the cyclone, with a further 920,000 people affected in Malawi and many thousands more in Zimbabwe. 
So how common is extreme weather in southern Africa, and were these countries sufficiently prepared? 
Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. 
Most form in the central Indian Ocean, sufficiently far enough off the coast for some preparations to be made. 
Cyclone Idai was unusual in that it formed in the Mozambique Channel, close to the coastline, giving governments and aid agencies less time to issue warnings and make plans.
""The cyclone was by no stretch of the imagination the most powerful... but what made it so devastating was where and how it hit,"" said Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization.
""The ocean floor along the coast by Mozambique is conducive to give storm surges, which reached roughly 3.5m-to-4m in the coastal city of Beira - which is absolutely huge.""
The low-lying coastal areas of central Mozambique are highly vulnerable to natural disasters but the budget for preparing and responding to them is very small. 
Last year, the government received support from international donors for a disaster fund of $18.3m (£13.9m) for 2018 and 2019.
This contingency plan is the main source of funding for any disaster response and is intended specifically for search and rescue within the first 72 hours.
For a major disaster such as Cyclone Idai, most of the funds for recovery and reconstruction are raised after a disaster has struck. 
And even without this latest emergency, Mozambique was facing economic strains as a result of a controversial loan deal in 2016 which resulted in a suspension of some international donor aid to the government.
Media captionAerial footage showing the disaster in Mozambique
How much warning?
The meteorological office of Mozambique, Inam, issued weather alerts as the storm developed.
Three days before the cyclone struck, the government raised the alert to the highest possible level, telling people to evacuate threatened areas. 
Some people were moved out by boat beforehand, but many didn't respond to warnings or weren't aware of them. 
""These public alerts were made in a timely fashion but it's always down to actors along the chain to decide how to act on this type of information,"" says Joao de Lima Rego, an adviser at Deltares, a research organisation focusing on coastal regions and river basins that has helped develop a forecasting system in Mozambique. 
As part of the forward planning for severe weather, safe zones had been created in rural areas for evacuation above the flood plain. 
On this occasion, however, the flooding was far more severe than anticipated.

Preparations in urban areas
The port city of Beira, with a population of half a million, had introduced measures to strengthen resilience to cyclones and flooding. 
Preparedness has focused on drainage systems, says Dinis Juizo, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo. 
Drainage canals and flood-control protection, such as a large water basin, have also been introduced.
However, much of the population of Beira outside the city centre live in informal housing often made of materials unable to withstand severe weather.
""The level of investment has not been high enough for an event of this scale,"" says Dinis Juizo.

 Aid agencies have faced challenges in getting resources to flood-hit areas of Mozambique
Malawi and Zimbabwe
The storm that eventually became Cyclone Idai had caused deaths in Malawi, to the north of Mozambique, in early March.
People in lowland areas were warned, but because warnings about flooding and rainfall are an annual occurrence during the rainy season, many people were reluctant to move and didn't anticipate the extent to which the country would suffer.
In Zimbabwe, there were also warnings about the approaching storm. 
But Zimbabwe's Minister of Defence, Oppah Muchinguri, has said her government failed to anticipate its strength. 
By the time the storm reached Zimbabwe it had weakened considerably and was no longer a tropical cyclone.
Nevertheless, it had a severe impact on the eastern regions of the country.

Flood-hit Iran is evacuating more towns and villages as forecasts show further rain is expected on Saturday.
Heavy downpours are set to strike the south western provinces of the country as officials plan to release water from key river dams that are near capacity. 
Women and children are being moved to safer areas while men are asked to stay and assist with relief efforts. 
In recent weeks, much of the country has been submerged and the death toll currently stands at 70.
Towns such as Susangerd, with a population of 50,000, will be left at risk and it will be evacuated on Saturday, along with around five other communities in the province of Khuzestan.

Around 70 villages in the province have already been evacuated over the past week. 
The region is rich in oil and energy companies placed in the area have been assisting with the flood relief by using pumps to remove water. 
Extremely heavy rain began on March 19, in total affecting about 1,900 cities, towns and villages. Many thousands of roads, bridges and buildings have been destroyed. 
So far, 86,000 people are living in emergency shelters, of which about 1,000 were airlifted to safety. 
Aid agencies are struggling to cope with the demands and Iran's state budget is under pressure due to US sanctions on energy and banking. 
Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has accused US sanctions - reimposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year - of impeding aid efforts to affected areas, saying that it has caused a shortage of rescue helicopters.
""This isn't just economic warfare; it's economic terrorism,"" Mr Zarif tweeted on April 1.
The government has maintained that people, especially farmers, will be compensated for their losses. 
The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said the armed forces were ""using all their power"" to minimise damage. 
By BBC Reality Check
Environmental experts believe that deforestation has been one of the major causes of flooding in recent years in the country.
According to Iran's Natural Resources and Forestry Organization, widespread and unregulated deforestation has destroyed around half of Iran's northern forests, areas where major floods have occurred.
According to the organisation, the northern forests area has been reduced from 3.6 million to 1.8 million hectares during the past 40 years.

Parts of southern Africa have been left devastated after Cyclone Idai swept through Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands more have been affected. Even though the cyclone hit Mozambique over a week ago, aid agencies are warning that the disaster is getting worse. Here are three reasons why:
1. More floods
The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday 14 March, and the subsequent flood submerged much of the city. 
But aid agencies warn that other areas continue to be at risk of becoming submerged. 
That's because it is still raining.
Two rivers, including the Buzi, burst their banks after rain in Zimbabwe and Malawi at the weekend, sending even more torrents of water into Mozambique.
And more rivers risk bursting their banks, says Rotafina Donco, Oxfam programme manager in Mozambique.
She told BBC Newsday that this rain was affecting most of the rivers in Mozambique that flow into the Indian Ocean. 
She said she expected more casualties. 
As late as Tuesday, she received information that people in Manica province, near the Zimbabwean border, much further inland from the epicentre of the crisis, Beira, were stranded on rooftops because one of the rivers had burst and the area had become submerged. 
In Mozambique waters are expected to rise by up to eight metres, putting at least 350,000 people at risk, says the Disaster Emergencies Committee (DEC).
A similar situation is playing out in Zimbabwe. 
Herve Verhoosel, spokesperson for the UN World Food Programme said in a statement that heavy rains in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces continue to cause massive destruction. 
The Marowanyati dam in Buhera, Manicaland has overflowed, raising river levels, he added.
2. Cholera
An outbreak of cholera could lead to the death toll increasing exponentially. 
Cholera is spread through human waste in the water supply. 
The flood water itself isn't the primary risk. Instead the risk comes because the existing drinking water supplies having been damaged by the flooding. 
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 Water supplies have been cut in Beira since the cyclone hit
This means people are finding it harder to find safe water. Larger groups of people are also sharing the same water supply, which increases the risk of cholera spreading quickly. 
""It's bound to rear its head at some point,"" says Paolo Cernuschi, Zimbabwe Country Director at the International Rescue Committee.
But that doesn't mean inevitable disaster. 
That's because cholera is relatively easy to contain when there is good healthcare available - people just need rehydration salts and to be put on an IV drip, he says. 
So, Mr Cernuschi says, there is the ""race against time"" to get the healthcare all set up before an outbreak happens.
More on Cyclone Idai: 
The worst-case scenario is that cholera breaks out in an area that is inaccessible, where there is no health care and spreads, Mr Cernuschi, said. 
Currently an area his organisation is finding it difficult to access is Zimbabwe's south-eastern town of Chimanimani - making it difficult to tell whether cholera has already begun to spread. 
Other waterborne diseases like typhoid and malaria also pose a risk, Mr Cernuschi says. 
Malaria in particular is likely to spread because the aftermath of the flood there is an increase in stagnant water - the preferred breeding ground of mosquitoes that spread malaria. 
Standing water also creates a risk of diarrheal diseases, Christian Lindmeier of the WHO told Newsday. 
Even though there is water everywhere it is not safe enough to drink.

Access to safe water is vital to prevent any further disease, says Mr Lindmeier.
Relief efforts need to deliver clean water or water purification tablets.
And that's the issue. 
""Getting there is the biggest challenge,"" he says.
The floods have cut off land routes and the only way to get to people is by air or water. 
3. Starvation
While people may make it through the next few weeks with the energy biscuits and water purification tablets that are currently being airdropped, a more long-term threat of starvation still looms.
Mr Cernuschi explains that the cyclone has compounded a crisis that was already there. 
He says drought in parts of Zimbabwe had already written off an estimated 75% of crops in the areas affected by the cyclone.
""Whatever crops that were being grown despite the drought have now been destroyed in the floods,"" he says.
He warns of a food insecurity crisis in the next six to 12 months - when people will face starvation as a result of the cyclone destroying their crops. 
As for the country that is worst hit by the cyclone, Mozambique, a total of 600,000 people are believed to be in need of help, writes Andre Vornic from the World Food Programme.

 Queensland's northern cattle region was devastated by floods in February
Like many other Australian graziers, Matt Bennetto could only start to count the dead after the rain had stopped.
Flying in a helicopter over his sodden cattle station, he was confronted by the ""nightmare"" of mass cattle losses.
Animals were strewn across pastures which had turned into water and mud.
""We probably flew over 10,000 carcasses that day, just going over my place and the neighbours',"" he told the BBC.
His cattle at Julia Creek were among an estimated 500,000 livestock wiped out when a flood disaster hit northern Queensland earlier this month.
Image copyrightCOWAN DOWNS STATION/REUTERSImage caption
 Animals seek higher ground to escape the waters
""To see them all dead along the fence lines and in the corners - can you imagine that scene?"" he said.
""You spend your whole life trying to breed beautiful animals and then you see something like that. It's beyond heartbreaking.""
Massive rainfall
Queensland's cattle industry, worth A$8.6bn (£4.7bn; $6bn), is reeling after the losses in the state's north.
Rain pummelled 13 million hectares of dedicated farming land - an area about the size of England - killing a third of cattle there. The bulk of flooding stretched, in rough terms, between towns Normanton and Winton.
Some areas received three times their average annual rainfall in a week. 
At first the deluge was welcomed by farmers, who had sustained their cattle through years of drought. 
But as waters rose, the situation quickly turned and led to animals drowning. Many more died from exposure to the elements.
""These cattle are bred in hot, dry conditions,"" Mr Bennetto said. ""Right before the rain they had gone through a week of over 40-degree [Celsius] temperatures.
""For an animal who can live in such extreme heat, they're not good at surviving in that cold rain.""
Logistical challenges
The Queensland floods have come in an Australian summer that has been marked by natural disasters.
A number of other mass wildlife deaths have been recorded amid record-breaking heatwaves, and bushfires have destroyed homes in three states.
In the coastal Queensland city of Townsville, floodwaters led to two deaths.
Media captionThe coastal city of Townsville, east of the cattle regions, was also flooded
Further west, in the region of the mass cattle deaths, the floodwaters have receded but a crisis remains.
""Producers are attempting to save as many cattle as possible, getting them out of mud and water, and providing them with fodder and medical attention,"" said Michael Guerin, head of AgForce, the industry's peak body in Queensland.
The army has helped bury carcasses and fly hay bales to surviving animals.

 The army has assisted the recovery effort
Charles Adler from Rural Aid, a charity which organised drop-offs, described it as a logistical challenge.
""Some of these stations are 150km long, so finding alive cattle was a very difficult exercise. And then they're scattered everywhere in small mobs, so we're ferrying bales by chopper one at a time,"" he said.
He said animals stuck in mud were starving, while others were dying from shock, pneumonia and Three Day Sickness - a bovine fever spread by mosquitoes. 
Another grazier, Rachael Anderson, has lost at least 2,000 animals - about half of her herd - at her station in Julia Creek. She said the numbers were continuing to rise.
""We had lots of mothers birth just after the rain, but then die from exhaustion. So I'm hand-rearing 12 calves but there will be more,"" she said.
""Lots of people are in the same boat. We are just saving whatever lives we can.""
'Rebuilding from scratch'
The estimated half a million deaths represent only a portion of Australia's total cattle industry, which numbers about 27 million. 
But for northern Queensland, the toll is immense.

 An area the size of England was flooded, authorities say
Authorities have put the combined financial loss for about 800 graziers at more than A$5bn. Some farms will not have cash flow for up to three years, AgForce warns.
The region's industry now has to ""rebuild itself almost from scratch"", according to Mr Guerin. He said restocking may take years, while replacing prized ""bloodlines"" could take decades.
Some graziers find it almost too hard to contemplate. As Mr Adler said: ""They've struggled for seven years to keep their animals alive in the drought, and now they're left with the futility of all that.""
Mr Bennetto, who lost more than 70% of his livestock, said he had chosen to suspend operations at his station for now.
""We're just not in a position to come back right now,"" he said. ""Maybe in a couple of months, we can get back on our feet and keep going. But I've already started a new job this week just so we can afford to pay our bills.""

 Rebuilding will be a very long process, graziers say
The government has offered up to A$75,000 in aid for each grazier.
But Ms Anderson said recovery would be ""very, very hard"", and in her case take at least 10 years.

 The town of Sentani was one of the worst affected areas
At least 58 people have been killed in flash floods in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.
Rescue workers are struggling to reach remote parts of the province, and there are fears the number of dead may rise.
Roads have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, and floodwaters have damaged two bridges and more than 100 houses.
More than 4,000 people have been forced from their homes, and some are sheltering in government offices.
Local residents said torrential rain began on Saturday evening and continued into the night, triggering mudslides and flash floods.

""Our house was flooded with thick mud... we immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbour's [two-storey] house to seek refuge,"" said mother-of-two Lili Puji Hastuti, quoted by Agence France-Presse.
""It's hard to get out of the area because many roads are blocked... I'm worried, sad and scared all at once.""
The search for victims continues in the town of Sentani, one of the worst affected areas. 
Fifty-one people were killed in the town, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, quoted by Reuters news agency.
The other seven confirmed deaths were in the nearby provincial capital Jayapura, Mr Nugroho added.
However, a five-month-old baby was rescued in the city after being trapped under the rubble for hours, according to the military.
Meanwhile a propeller aircraft was partly crushed on the runway of Jayapura airport.
Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the October-April rainy season.
In January, floods killed at least 70 people on the island of Sulawesi, and heavy rain in West Java earlier in March displaced hundreds.
Emergency officials say that in recent months they had warned the Papuan authorities of flood risks due to deforestation of mountains surrounding Jayapura.

,"Media captionSimon Allen: ""We'd like to see this upscaled to the whole of High Mountain Asia""
The flood danger posed by glacial lakes across the Tibetan Plateau has been assessed in the most comprehensive study of its kind so far.
Swiss and Chinese scientists looked at 1,300 of these water bodies that have built up in front of ice streams and which are dammed by rocky debris.
The fear is that these lakes can overtop their barriers and send floods downstream that overrun settlements.
The team has found 210 (16%) to have the potential to threaten communities.
It is information local decision-makers can now use to prioritise strategies to mitigate the risk, says Simon Allen, whose group at the University of Zurich worked alongside colleagues from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research in Beijing.
""One of the key aspects of this study is that we identify important situations where lakes have developed in China, but most of the threat is downstream in Nepal, across the border,"" he told BBC News. 
""We call these 'transnational boundary threats'. So, these are important because it is much more complex to manage the response of two countries.""
Dr Allen was speaking here at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly. 
Image copyrightDaniel Alton Byers CC BY-SA 3.0Image caption
 Lakes that get too big will sometimes be drained by local agencies
He said the assessment carried out in the central Himalaya should be repeated across High Mountain Asia.
There are several mechanisms that can generate a Glacial Lake Flood Outburst (Glof). But the one of the most common in the Tibetan region sees an ice avalanche come down the steep slope of a glacier into the lake to drive a large wave over the dam.
It was the potential for just such a scenario that the team's automated satellite survey considered. But, crucially, the reality of humans actually being in the way of any flood was also taken into account. 
""A lot of the unstable lakes are far too remote to affect people,"" said Dr Allen. ""Only 210 out of these nearly 2,000 lakes could potentially threaten human settlements. So, this is already useful information for policymakers - they can then focus on these lakes. These are the hotspots of risk.""
Image copyrightUniversity of ZurichImage caption
 The team takes a small boat to the lakes to measure their depth, and therefore a volume
Top of the list of the team's 30 most dangerous lakes is Cirenmaco, which has experienced three major disasters in the past 100 years. In 1981, 200 people died in a lake outburst. 
Second on the list Galongco, a lake with 10 times the area of Cirenmaco. The scientists have recently been to Galongco to measure its depth, to work out a volume. 
""These type of studies have to be repeated every five or 10 years because these lakes are growing and new lakes are formed all the time,"" Dr Allen told reporters at EGU. 
""We would like this study to be replicated across High Mountain Asia - in countries like India and Pakistan - because there is a lot of money going into Glof projects, but this kind of study should be the starting point so that we're not wasting money in the wrong regions or on the wrong lakes.""",A comprehensive study assesses the flood danger posed by glacial lakes across the Tibetan Plateau.,,2019-04-10,BBC News,Study identifies danger glacial lakes across Tibetan Plateau,

 Harpreet Kaur wrote to the prime minister, requesting him to change the name of her village
Across the northern Indian states of Haryana and Rajasthan, many villages with ""embarrassing"" names have been pushing to get them changed for years now. BBC Punjabi's Arvind Chhabra talks to some of the people who have been leading this campaign.
""My village's name is Ganda [meaning dirty or ugly in Hindi],"" Harpreet Kaur wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016 in an attempt to officially change its name. She added that just the name of the village was enough to prompt humiliating taunts from whomever she met. 
""The situation was so bad that even our relatives mock us relentlessly,"" she said. 
In 2017, Mr Modi directed authorities to change the village's name. Today, the renamed village of Ajit Nagar stands proudly in the northern Indian state of Haryana.
The village council chief, Lakwinder Ram, said they had been trying for years to get the attention of the government and change the name. ""When that didn't work, we thought that perhaps a young person writing directly to Mr Modi might move him,"" he said. ""There was not a soul in the village who didn't want the name to change.""
Locals say that Ganda got its name when a flood ravaged the area decades ago. An officer who visited in the aftermath of the disaster saw all the debris that had been swept in and remarked that it was extremely dirty or ""ganda"". Since then, they say, the name just stuck. 
Mr Ram added that the name of the village also drove away potential grooms since they did not want a bride from a village that had such a humiliating name. ""We are extremely relieved now,"" he said. 
But Ganda is hardly a unique case. 
Representatives from more than 50 villages have pestered the Indian government for a name change in the recent past. The reasons are varied - some names are seen as racist, others were just bizarre and a few more downright embarrassing for its inhabitants. 
""The requests of some 40 villages have been accepted and implemented,"" Krishan Kumar, a senior federal government official, said. 
Among these, is a village called Kinnar which means transgender in Hindi. That became Gaibi Nagar in 2016. 
And in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, a village in Alwar district used to be called Chor Basai. But since the word chor means thief in Hindi, the village's new name is now just Basai. 
Image caption
 Mughalsarai is located about 20km from the holy city of Varanasi in northern India
But the process to get the name of a village changed is not that easy. 
To begin with, the state government must be convinced enough to take up the issue with the Indian government, which has the final authority. 
But before they can grant the request, the government also has to get clearances from other official units including the railways and postal department as well as the Survey of India. This is to ensure that the new proposed name does not exist anywhere else in the country.

 A sign board in Lula Ahir
For residents of Lula Ahir village in Haryana state - a derogatory term for a disabled person in Hindi- the process has been fraught with bureaucracy. They first wrote to the state government in 2016, unhappy with the village name.
""We wanted to change the name to Dev Nagar,"" village council chief Virender Singh said.
They waited for a response for six months - only to receive a rejection letter since a village named Dev Nagar already exists somewhere else in the country.
Back at the drawing board, the village council decided to try once again with another name - Krishan Nagar. ""We wrote to the administration again and kept following it up with them,"" Mr Singh said. ""But it just went from one department to another."" 
In July, they thought their luck had changed when the state's chief minister announced that the village had a new name. Instead, they found out that the decision hadn't been formally implemented by the central government yet. Officials confirmed that the request is still ""under process"".

She was not alone. Some 3,000 supporters turned out to oppose a Shield and Sword (SS) festival taking place in a hotel on the outskirts of the town, metres from the Polish border. ""Why Ostritz?"" a journalist asked Thorsten Heise, the head of the extreme-right National Democratic Party (NPD) in the nearby State of Thuringia, and one of the organisers of the neo-Nazi event. ""Why not?"" he responded. ""There's not enough going on in Saxony. We're making politics more lively."" Support for far-right parties has blossomed here. In the 2017 federal election more than 30% of people in this district voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD). But many townspeople and their supporters are determined not to let Ostritz become the poster-town for the extreme right. East's far-right surge Ostritz, population 2,400, lies in Saxony, a state that has become a cradle for far-right ideas in Germany. It was once part of East Germany, and many people here are still affected by the changes that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. When the factories closed, thousands left for the West - including Eva Hauptfleisch's parents, who fled to Frankfurt, where she was later born. Image caption Ostritz has just under 2,400 residents and lies just west of the Polish border Many of those who stayed lost their livelihoods, as their new compatriots from the west took over businesses and bought houses. Twenty-eight years later, many former East Germans are entering retirement on the poverty line. Angela Merkel's decision to welcome one million refugees to Germany in 2015 ignited fears in the east of of further losses at their expense. The rally at the end of October was the second time this year that Eva Hauptfleisch returned to Ostritz to protest. Image caption A heavy police presence followed the neo-Nazi festival - along with the media She and many others were here in April too to challenge the first neo-Nazi event organised by the NPD in their town. ""This town was sleeping,"" she says. ""Many people are depressed because they lost their work and they didn't have the chance to go somewhere else."" Yet the return of the far right has jolted Ostritz awake. The far right in eastern Germany The neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD) was elected to Saxony's state parliament in 2004 and 2009 Its support base halved as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party made electoral gains AfD won 13% of the vote in the 2017 German elections, winning 92 seats and becoming the biggest party in opposition Support for AfD in the east is on average double its size in the west, but the party is now represented in all 16 states It is the weekend of the neo-Nazi festival, and the cobbled market square is filled with young families. A procession in rainbow colours, led by a man in leopard print, dances through the streets. Image caption Bright colours abound at the counter-protest by residents and their supporters ""We have to act now to preserve our valued democratic system, which is being jeopardised by neo-Nazis, far-right extremists and their assistants within our state parliaments and within the government,"" Michael Schlitt, the organiser of the peace festival, tells the crowd. ""We must not voluntarily grant them any space - not one single metre."" Across town, hundreds of armed police surround the neo-Nazi festival in the paint-splattered Hotel Neisseblick. Inside, young men and women browse merchandise stands selling CDs by popular ""hatecore"" bands, whose lyrics invoke images of a war-torn Germany defended by patriotic men. Image caption So-called ""hatecore"" music is popular with the neo-Nazi crowd, and widely available at the festival T-shirts bear slogans with barely concealed Nazi messages. Tattoos of banned symbols, such as the swastika, are covered up with tape. 'We have woken up' Hans-Peter Fischer, the owner of the hotel, says he is happy the neo-Nazis have returned to Ostritz as their festival brings in revenue. ""This was the only way to make sales here,"" he says, pointing out that he did not receive any compensation when his property was damaged in a flood. Four similar events are planned at the hotel in 2019. Image caption In contrast with the rainbow procession outside, black is the colour of choice at the festival But the village will oppose them, vows Ostritz mayor Marion Prange. One evening, she joins the townspeople as they light candles and encircle the square, singing in harmony, while police look on.

 Cyclone Idai is an ""unprecedented natural disaster"" that no-one could have predicted, a Mozambican minister has said
The UN has said the final casualty figure after Cyclone Idai tore through southern Africa more than a week ago will only be known once the flood waters have receded. 
At least 417 people have now been declared dead in Mozambique, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia has said.
The new figure puts the overall death toll at about 700 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
It is expected to rise further.
The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Saturday that the Buzi and Zambezi rivers were at risk of breaking their banks again.
""We're going to have to wait until the flood waters recede until we know the full expanse of the toll on the people of Mozambique,"" OCHA co-ordinator Sebastian Rhodes Stampa said.
Thousands remain trapped by the floodwaters, and many of the Mozambican government's relief centres have only just started receiving food supplies - more than a week after the storm first struck. 
Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods.
Media caption'It has become an inland sea'
On Friday, cases of cholera were recorded in Beira in central Mozambique.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria.
Idai made landfall near Beira, a city of 500,000 people, with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March.
Aid workers are slowly delivering relief, but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and helicopters scarce.
Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. 
Nearly 90,000 Mozambicans are thought to be sheltering in temporary sites, while thousands of others are still stranded in floodwaters, AFP news agency reports.

 People in China can pay with their phones to enter make-up rooms, complete with cosmetics
A new trend of ""shareable make-up rooms"" aimed at urban women is igniting debate in China, as companies try new ways to grab a slice of the world's largest market for beauty products.
The rooms represent a new frontier in China's vast sharing economy. Some think they are an affordable way to get to use expensive make-up, while others shudder at the thought of sharing a lipstick with a stranger. 
Although they have been springing up in many Chinese cities since late last year, a recent opening in eastern Wuhan has prompted a flood of discussion online.
But how do you use one, and are they likely to take off elsewhere? 
How do they work?
Using their phones, customers scan a Quick Response (QR) code to pay a small fee, and enter a room with a chair and dressing table. 
An array of beauty products is spread out on the table, including products from high-end Western brands.
Users can help themselves to a range of products: moisturisers, powders, eye shadows and lipsticks. The room also provides brushes and other application tools for people to use. 
Image copyrightChutian Metropolis DailyImage caption
 Users can help themselves to a variety of make-up products
Products in the Wuhan store are worth an estimated 4,000 yuan ($590; £460), according to the Chutian Metropolis Daily newspaper, so it is not surprising that CCTV watches over users as they beautify themselves.
It costs a small amount to use one of the rooms from anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes. In the Wuhan branch, the maximum a customer can expect to spend in one sitting is 58 yuan ($8.50; £6.70). 
How are they viewed?
Young women who have tried the rooms and who the BBC spoke to had mostly positive impressions.
""I thought the shared make-up room was great, a very creative idea and a very novel invention,"" said Ms Liu, a woman in her twenties from Wuhan. Though she added: ""I may not go often because I don't think they're very practical.""
Another in Shanghai said she would use them again, because she felt her skin was especially damaged and she needed to have access to high-end products. 
Online comments suggested a more mixed response.
Image copyrightPear VideoImage caption
 Ms Feng told Pear Video that she would go back if make-up rooms provided authentic products
Some on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo service said that they thought the concept would make money because it allows people to try products without ""being bombarded by servicewomen at make-up counters"", or forced into an expensive sale for something that might not be right for them. 
One user in eastern Shandong province said she thought the room was ""good"", especially as disposable application tools were provided. 
But others have concerns about the idea of sharing certain make-up products with strangers. 
""Lipstick, for example, lots of people will use - that's not very hygienic,"" one Wuhan-based user told the Pear Video website. 
""Cosmetics are personal items, I can't really accept this,"" another said. Others expressed concern about contracting viruses or skin conditions.
Chinese shareable make-up pods could ultimately attract up to 80 customers a day, one seller told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. But at present just a handful of people are visiting.
Image copyrightPear VideoImage caption
 Ms Hu said that while the pods were a good idea in principle, sharing products like lipsticks was ""unhygienic""
Are they really a new concept?
Self-contained shareable make-up pods are still a relatively novel idea, and they have only begun appearing in China since October 2018. They are largely being set up by private companies, not the cosmetic brands themselves, and are now found in major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Nanjing. 
Large public dressing rooms offering similar services have been around in Japan and South Korea since as early as 2014. 
The concept is part of a wave of shareable products that have hit the Chinese market in recent years. Well-known services include shareable bikes and phone chargers; but the country is also home to more obscure rentable goods, including umbrellas and basketballs. 
China promotes shareable technologies for having both economic and environmental benefits, and in the case of luxury brands, helping Chinese users distinguish between fake and real goods in an increasingly saturated market. 
So will they take off?
It is entirely possible, given the surging spending power of urban consumers and their willingness to spend their disposable cash on cosmetic products.
Research from OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants says that China has the largest skincare market in the world, worth US$22bn, followed by the US. 
Chinese women, according to the group's findings, have added more steps and products to their daily beauty routine in recent years, with the average Chinese woman surveyed having a 6 or 7-step daily skincare regime before applying make-up. Some had as many as nine daily steps. 
Pascal Martin, a partner at the company, says China has a ""massive [cosmetics] market with massive growth opportunity"". 
""International brands used to be dominant; it's a market in which everyone is competing,"" he says. ""Yet, you can see Chinese brands gaining share year after year."" 
The appeal of young, fresh-faced celebrities like the popular TFBoys band has also led to a surge in spending on skincare products, with consumers splashing out on products because of the associations with their favourite icon. 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The male beauty industry is also taking off in China
So-called ""little fresh meats"", men who have delicate or feminine features, have become key influencers among young, urban Chinese and are known to team up with local cosmetics brands.
Social media platforms have also seen a rising trend of video make-up tutorials.
And with young Chinese increasingly working longer hours outside the home, and spending more time online, the concept of a shareable make-up room may well prove desirable.
But Pascal Martin says that they are still in the experimental stage, and he is not convinced they will see mass take-off. 
He says that concerns about hygiene could pose a significant risk.
""It is not impossible that the promoters of this concept may have convinced investors to put money in it, even if the concept is not bullet-proof.
""There are many examples in China of original concepts that suddenly take off with the backing of massive venture capital, and then hit reality before scaling down or disappearing.""

Almost half its people 49% say they faced ""fake news"" in the week before the survey was taken. In Germany, it is just 9%. Every day brings new outlandish and unverified claims in the media. This is fodder for a nation addicted to conspiracy theories where a senior adviser to Mr Erdogan claimed the president's enemies were trying to kill him with telekinesis and that foreign TV chefs were spies. Image caption This Turkish story called the BBC's correspondent a ""provocateur"" sent to cover a march involving Turkish opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu Inflammatory rhetoric pervades the media, 90% of which is estimated to be pro-government. That is because opposition outlets have been steadily shut down, branded ""terrorist propaganda"", or financially crippled. Newspapers that survive serve not as models of journalism but as government mouthpieces, which were recently handed the leaks from the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. That led the world to swallow what they printed, rather than treating them with the usual caution. Turkey is the world's largest jailer of journalists, ranking 157 of 180 countries in the press freedom index of the watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Just 38% here trust the news, the Reuters study shows. How a website debunked 500 fake stories Fertile ground, then, for Turkey's first independent website devoted to fact-checking online material. Teyit.org takes its name from the Turkish word for confirmation. Founded in 2016 by a young journalist, Mehmet Atakan Foca, its team probes the authenticity of photographs and stories that circulate online. Foca, who did an internship at the BBC Turkish service, says they now get more than 30 tip-offs a day about suspicious-looking material, and use a variety of core journalistic skills and digital technology to check them. Image caption The Teyit team have debunked hundreds of stories in their first two years ""To tackle the problem of fake news, it's not enough to publish articles about misinformation,"" he says. ""We want to educate people and give them the tools to strengthen their capacity for verification."" Over the past two years, Teyit has debunked 526 false stories. Many are political, using doctored photographs or false social media claims about politicians. Others have even more serious consequences. This story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us. For more visit www.bbc.co.uk/beyondfakenews When photos of three men were published online and labelled as those who killed 39 people in an attack on Istanbul's Reina nightclub, Teyit traced the men and disproved the allegations. One of the wrongly accused, Metehan Alim, told us a defamation case against six media outlets is ongoing. Image copyright Teyit Image caption Many of Teyit's debunked stories are political, or deal with social issues ""Turks are fundamentalists with our beliefs,"" he told the BBC. ""We want to read what we already believe. We resist science or facts. We believe in myths instead."" Some of the stories debunked by Teyit are international. At the height of the violence in Myanmar against Rohingya Muslims, the Turkish finance minister tweeted photos that allegedly showed victims. Teyit discovered they were from elsewhere. The Myanmar government formally complained and the minister was forced to delete the tweet. Even former Ankara mayor Melih Gokcek, notorious for conspiracy theories, retracted a tweet showing a photograph purportedly of flood damage to a road. It had been debunked by Teyit, and he even credited the fact-checking website. How I became a target for fake news But I am still waiting for Mr Gokcek to retract his unfounded claim that the BBC rented a hotel room overlooking Besiktas football stadium just before it was attacked by suicide bombers in 2016. Supposedly, that allowed me to broadcast live within minutes - and suggested that we were complicit or knew of it in advance. Media caption Mark Lowen reported on the Besiktas bombing some 90 minutes after the attack The absurd allegation was disproved by Teyit, showing my first live broadcast from our BBC office 90 minutes after the attack and debunking a video that falsely translated my words. Image caption Teyit debunked the Besiktas allegations, showing that the live report came from the BBC office After four years in Turkey, I'm getting used to such baseless claims. Pro-government dailies frequently allege I've been sent from London as a provocateur to stir up social unrest. One needs a thick skin in this country. Rise of the 'fake fact-checkers' ""News literacy is very low in Turkey,"" says Mehmet Atakan Foca. ""It's more about propaganda. People live in an echo chamber, accusing others of being terrorists or pro-government, creating false stories to strengthen their opinions."" Even fact-checking itself is used as a tool in a country riven by mistrust and division. One website claims to be an independent verifier of news, but is actually run by a prominent columnist for Sabah, the main pro-government daily, and her husband. Instead of authenticating sources or photographs, it pushes the government line, discrediting perceived criticism of President Erdogan. ""There is no freedom of information in Turkey"", Mr Foca says, ""so fake fact-checking websites are used as propaganda."" ""They're another weapon of government"", he adds. Controlling information, peddling false stories, fuelling the ""us and them"" narrative: these are all tactics of authoritarian governments. They are all major challenges for the fact-checkers aiming to go beyond fake news.","Fake news in Turkey is rampant, and targets many, including the BBC.

,"The 12th hole at Augusta is arguably the most famous par three in the world
2019 Masters
Date: 11-14 April Venue: Augusta National
Coverage: Watch highlights of the first two days before live and uninterrupted coverage of the final rounds on BBC Two, with up to four live streams online. Live radio and text commentary of all four days on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and mobile app. Full details
In 1986 I was allowed to stay up late to watch the end of the Masters. I knew little about the tournament, other than that my dad was a fan, but he was allowing me to be up way beyond my bedtime so I was all in.
It proved a decent introduction. Jack Nicklaus destroyed Greg Norman by taking just 30 shots for the last nine holes to win a record sixth Green Jacket. 
The roars were loud, the colours vibrant, water everywhere. The roars got louder. The television commentary was sublime. I was hooked.
It's taken 33 years to visit Augusta National for the first time. Here are five reasons it's been on my bucket list.
The traditions
The Masters is about so much more than the four days that decide the winner.
The tournament is neatly packaged between the honorary starter's drive on Thursday and the presentation of the Green Jacket in the Butler Cabin on Sunday.
But even before the opening tee shot, there is Tuesday's Champions Dinner and Wednesday's par-three contest to lighten the mood.
The menu for the Champions Dinner is created by the previous year's winner. In 1997, England's Nick Faldo chose tomato soup followed by fish and chips. In 2012, Charl Schwartzel requested a South African braai - a type of barbecue - with monkey gland sauce.
Defending champion Patrick Reed has opted for the safer option of steak, mac and cheese, and creamed vegetables.
""I'm definitely going to fatten everyone up,"" said Reed, who has included grilled chicken and seafood ""to try to please the 30-something men"".
The par-three contest has a relaxed air, with players' partners, children and friends donning the caddies' white boiler suits and allowed to hit tee shots and putts.
Beware the 'par-three curse' though - in the 58 years it has been contested, nobody has won it and then gone on to secure the Green Jacket.
All the while the patrons - always patrons, never spectators - move serenely around the course. They have to, or they risk being chucked out.
The rules are simple. No running. No shouting. No mobile phones. And if you have a Masters-approved chair, you can plonk it in your favourite place, wander off for the day and return safe in the knowledge nobody will have touched it.
The patrons are handsomely rewarded for their good behaviour. Pimento cheese sandwiches - a local favourite - set them back a little over £1, while a local beer is not much over a couple of quid.
And then there's big John Daly. He's becoming something of a Masters institution. The 1995 Open champion is in Augusta again this year, but not to play. He has set up his van in a parking lot just round the corner from the entrance, selling memorabilia.
The great shots
All majors have their fair share of memorable shots, but what helps the Masters feel more special is the fact it is in the same place each year so certain shots and pin positions become imprinted in our minds.
In the video below we have compiled our top 10, although there have been so many to choose from we're bound to have missed one or two. And even if you can't view the video you can still cast your vote for your favourite from our list.

Masters 2019: Choose your favourite Masters shot of all time from this top 10
One shot we've not been able to include is 1935 champion Gene Sarazen's ""shot heard around the world"". It's arguably the greatest of them all because it helped catapult the infant Masters into the mainstream. 
But because there was no television footage, his albatross two from 230 yards on the par-five 15th will forever remain a mystery to all but those who were there.

Masters 2018: Patrick Reed holds nerve to beat rivals and win Masters
It's hillier even than I was warned to expect but under the gloomiest of skies, Augusta National is picture perfect.
The azaleas are blooming. The fairways are perfectly manicured. The greens are slick and true.
But where to go first? There are obvious pilgrimages. Behind the 16th tee is a bronze plaque dedicated to four-time winner Arnold Palmer. There's one for honorary starter Nicklaus on the way to the 17th tee.
Other popular places are to the left of the 16th green, from where Tiger Woods holed 'that chip' in 2005 (and to watch players skimming their tee shots across the water on to the green), and down the right of the 10th to see how Bubba Watson hooked a wedge 40 yards to win in 2012.
Amen Corner affords views of the second half of the 11th, the whole of the perilous short 12th, and the first half of the 13th. It's busy, though, even on practice days.
I stroll on, and wonder how 2017 champion Sergio Garcia managed to stick five balls in the pond at the 15th last year.

Masters Memories: Sergio Garcia's 13-shot ordeal from the 2018 Masters
After standing behind the 18th tee and picturing myself threading a driver down the middle of the narrow, tree-flanked tunnel that opens out on to the fairway, I amble down to inspect 'Sandy's bunker' - the one Scotland's Lyle smashed a seven-iron out of in 1988 on his way to becoming the first British winner.
The front nine is not as instantly recognisable. The long shot down the hill to the well-guarded second green is perhaps the most familiar, after Louis Oosthuizen's albatross two in 2012.
The uphill par-five eighth is a monster with a long, sinewy green but it really is all about…
…the back nine on Sunday 
There is an old saying that the Masters doesn't really start until the players hit the back nine in the final round.
So many championships have been won and lost on some of the most storied holes in golf. I've watched them all, and memories flood back as I see the shots for real.
Faldo won his third Green Jacket in 1996 when Norman bogeyed nine, 10 and 11 before finding water on 12 as a six-shot lead turned into a five-shot deficit.
American Jordan Spieth, who birdied four successive holes to lead by five with nine to play, looked nailed on to retain his title in 2016 but dropped shots at 10 and 11 and hit two balls into the water at 12 as England's Danny Willett won.
Then there was Rory McIlroy in 2011. The Northern Irishman started the final day with a four-shot lead but dropped six shots in three holes from the 10th, including taking four putts from 20 feet on the 12th. Schwartzel went on to win.
The stories
Woods claimed the first of his 14 majors at Augusta in 1997 - he has since won the event a further three times
There are so many to go at. Will McIlroy finally complete the career Grand Slam of all four majors? He has the game for Augusta National, with top-10 finishes in his previous five Masters, and he's in form having won the Players Championship last month.
Will England's world number one Justin Rose break his Masters duck after a couple of runners-up spots in recent years? Is his compatriot Tommy Fleetwood, who has twice gone close at the US Open, ready to win his first major?
Of the Americans it's impossible to ignore Woods. At 43, he is back up to 12 in the world rankings, the highest-ranked player in the field to have won here, albeit the last of his four triumphs was 14 years ago. Nicklaus won his last Masters 11 years after winning his fifth at the age of 46.
Spieth may have dropped to 33 in the world rankings but the 25-year-old 2015 champion also has two seconds and a third in his five appearances.
Rickie Fowler, who has finished runner-up in three of the four majors, and third at the 2014 US PGA Championship, is overdue a victory. The 30-year-old was 12 under for his final two rounds last year to push Reed close.
The truth is I could run through more than half the field and make a claim for them pulling on the Green Jacket on Sunday.
I'd love to see McIlroy complete his Slam, or Woods end his major drought, but there's little room for sentimentality in sport and I think there will be an English Rose overshadowing the azaleas on Sunday.","The shots, the course, the traditions.

,"Image copyright Susannah Savage Image caption Young women in the village are anxious about having children and providing for them In small villages along the eastern coast of Bangladesh, researchers have noticed an unexpectedly high rate of miscarriage. As they investigated further, scientists reached the conclusion that climate change might be to blame. Journalist Susannah Savage went into these communities to find out more. ""Girls are better than boys,"" says 30-year-old Al-Munnahar. ""Boys do not listen. They are arrogant. Girls are polite."" Al-Munnahar, who lives in a small village on the east coast of Bangladesh, has three sons but wished for a girl. Once she thought she would have a daughter, but she miscarried the baby. She is among several women who have lost a baby in her village. Image copyright Susannah Savage Image caption Almost all the food they eat in Al-Munnahar's village now has to be bought at markets some distance away While miscarriages are not out of the ordinary, scientists who follow the community have noticed an increase, particularly compared to other areas. The reason for this, they believe, is climate change. The walk to Failla Para, Al-Munnahar's village, is arduous: in the dry season, the narrow track leads into a swamp, and in rainy season, into the sea. The village itself is not much more than a mound of mud with a few shacks and a chicken pen perched precariously on the slippery surface. ""Nothing grows here anymore,"" says Al-Munnahar. Not many years ago - up until the 1990s - these swamp lands were paddy fields. Image copyright Susannah Savage Image caption The village, in the district of Chakaria, is built on salty mud, and families often live in wet, damp conditions when the water gets into their home If rice production back then was not profitable, it was at least viable. Not anymore. Rising waters and increasing salinity have forced the wealthiest among the villagers to change to shrimp farming or salt harvesting. Today, few paddy fields remain. ""This is climate change in action,"" says Dr Manzoor Hanifi, a scientist from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (ICDDRB), a research institute. ""The effect on the land is visible, but the effect on the body: that we don't see."" Brine and bribery ICDDRB have been running a health and demographic surveillance site in and around the district of Chakaria, near Cox's Bazaar, for the last thirty years, enabling them to detect even small changes in the health of the communities they monitor. Over the last few years, many families have left the plains and moved inland, into the forest hill areamostly those with enough money to bribe forest wardens. ""We paid a 230,000 Taka ($2,752, £2,106) bribe to build the house,"" says Kajol Rekha, who moved to the hills from the plains with her husband and two children three years ago. ""Because of the water, my kids would always have a fever, especially when our house remained wet after the flood. Everything is easier here."" These environmental migrants are faring relatively well, able to grow crops and nearer transport routes to access jobs and schools. They are also in better health than those they left behind. In particular, women inland are less likely to miscarry. Between 2012 and 2017, the ICDDRB scientists registered 12,867 pregnancies in the area they monitor, which encompasses both the hill area and the plains. They followed the pregnant women through until the end of the pregnancy and found that women in the coastal plains, living within 20km (12mi) of the coastline and 7m above sea level were 1.3 times more likely to miscarry than women who live inland. The difference may seem small, but the number of miscarriages on the plains seems to be growing, says Dr Hanifi. Moreover, when comparing the whole Chakaria region to Matlab, another area monitored by ICDDRB, in a part of Bangladesh far removed from the coast, the scientists also saw a noticeable difference. In Chakaria, 11% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. In Matlab it is 8%. This difference, the scientists believe, is to do with the amount of salt in the water the women drink - the increase of which is caused by climate change. Families with no choice Sea levels are rising, in part because of the melting of icecaps, but also because the earth's rising temperature effects atmospheric pressure: even a small change in this causes an inverse effect on the sea level. ""With a one millibar decrease in atmosphere pressure,"" says Dr Hanifi, ""the sea level rises by ten millimetres: a series of depressions in atmospheric pressure can cause a considerable rise in water levels in shallow ocean basins."" When sea levels rise, salty sea water flows into fresh water rivers and streams, and eventually into the soil. Most significantly, it also flows into underground water stores - called aquifers - where it mixes with, and contaminates, the fresh water. It is from this underground water that villages source their water, via tube wells. The water that the village pump in Failla Para spews out is a little red in colour. It is also full of salt. This does not stop villagers drinking from the pump, though - nor from bathing in it and washing and cooking their food in it. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people consume no more than 5g of salt per day. In Chakaria, those living in the coastal zone consume up to 16g per day - over three times what those in the hilly areas do. In countries like the UK, health campaigns have cautioned against excessive salt consumption for years. It causes hypertension, increasing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and, among pregnant women, miscarriages and preeclampsia. These Bangladeshi families have no idea of the health risk from the water they are drinking, and even if they did, they have little choice. Image copyright Susannah Savage Image caption Fifty-year old Janatara would never consider leaving ""Salt is bad for crops,"" says 50-year Janatara, who was born in the village and has never left. When asked if she or her family would leave Failla Para she laughs: ""No, of course not! I've been here my whole life, and anyway, where would we go? We are poor."" 'Life is so hard here' Her neighbour, 23-year old Sharmin would like to leave. She is uncertain what future there can be for her two sons in Failla Para: ""Life is so hard here,"" she says. Despite this, though, she plans to have another child soon. At the moment, the chance of miscarriage for women like Sharmin and Al-Munnahar is only slightly elevated. But unless something is done, says Dr Hanifi, ""this will only get worse, as Bangladesh feels the effects of climate change more and more."" Image copyright Susannah Savage Image caption Sharmin has two daughters, both of whom were delivered without a midwife As a low-lying country, full of flood plain land, Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to changes caused by global warming. But other countries elsewhere, are also likely to experience similar repercussions from rising sea levels. Across the Indian Ocean, the destruction caused by the 2005 tsunami caused saltwater to contaminate agricultural lands and freshwater drinking sources. In the American state of Florida, rising sea levels has also led to saltwater encroaching on bodies of fresh water. Surprisingly, however, the Chakaria health and demographic surveillance site, which monitors the health-related impact of climate change, is one of the only sites of its kind. ""A lot of money is being thrown at climate change interventions,"" says Dr Hanafi, ""but almost known of it goes into research - not for the public health impact anyway. Everyone is thinking about environmental disasters. No one is thinking about public health.""

 The Ilisos emerges overground
An ancient river could see the light of day again, thanks to a collapsing tramline in the centre of the Greek capital Athens.
Years of lax maintenance and natural erosion have left the route in such a poor state that trams stopped running last October, but this very modern problem could also turn into an historic opportunity, the Avgi newspaper reports.
The River Ilisos was mentioned by Plato, and saw philosophers from Socrates to the Cynics teach on its banks.
'Crimes of Athens'
But it was paved over as part of the post-war urban development drive, in what the Kathimerini daily called ""one of the many crimes that took place in Athens in the name of progress"".

 The 1950s saw the rapid development of Athens
It now runs in a tunnel under Vasileos Konstantinou and Kallirois Avenues, only to emerge briefly in a thicket behind the Temple of Olympia Zeus, where local enthusiasts have long been trying to clear space to show it off to better advantage
But all this may be about to change.

 The river Ilisos emerges briefly in reed beds behind the Temple of Olympian Zeus
He proposes to create a broad band of parkland on both banks of the newly-exposed river, running south from the Panathenaic Stadium - home of the revived 1896 Olympic Games - for 1.2 km (0.7 miles).
Mr Belavilas says the idea, which he first floated in November, is now a firm plan that has won some ""important allies"", Ethnos newspaper reports.
'Doesn't bear thinking about'
The Athens transport and water companies are on board with the scheme, which will involve re-routing the tramlines to create a direct pedestrian route from the Temple of Olympian Zeus to the National Gardens.
This route has been long-cherished by Athenians, but fell foul first of planning for the 2004 Summer Olympics, and then the 2008 financial crisis, Kathimerini recalls. 
But it is not just a simple matter of reclaiming the city's past, but also of saving its present.""If the Ilisos tunnel collapses, it will block the natural course of the river, and could flood the entire city centre,"" Mr Belavilas warns - ""That doesn't bear thinking about.""

The seedling of the mighty oak has had an unusual start in life. Raised using techniques pioneered in fertility labs, it is the product of new efforts to preserve the seeds of wild plants. The world is losing plants at an unprecedented rate, with about one in five thought to be at risk of extinction. ""It's an insurance policy against extinction in the wild,"" says Dr John Dickie of Kew's Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst in West Sussex. "" In situ conservation, in a reserve, is always the best, because then evolution can happen all the time. This is a very cost-effective back-up in case that system fails."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Oak tree in the countryside As a back-up in the event of doomsday scenarios such as war, seeds of crops and wild plants are being stored in bomb-proof, flood-proof, radiation-proof vaults. The goal is to store at least 75% of threatened plant species by 2020. But new predictions suggest this is unlikely to be achieved, because many seeds cannot be stored using conventional means. According to models published in the journal Nature Plants, 36% of critically endangered plant species, 33% of all trees and about 10% of medicinal plants fall into this category. ""Not all the plant species can be banked in the way of dried seeds in the freezer like we do in the seed bank,"" says Daniel Ballesteros, who works on cryopreservation at the Millennium Seed Bank. ""For example, we have the oaks and the chestnut that have desiccation-sensitive seeds and if we dry them, we kill them."" Researchers are investigating techniques such as cryopreservation for these hard to store seeds, which include staples such as coffee, chocolate and avocados, as well as heritage trees like the oak. Image copyright Royal Botanic Gardens Kew Image caption Cryopreservation relies on freezing plant embryos Cryopreservation involves removing the plant embryo from the rest of the seed, then freezing it at very low temperatures in liquid nitrogen. In this way, trees such as the oak can be stored for the future. But new investment will be needed to perfect the techniques and to build cryopreservation facilities alongside conventional seed banks. The Millennium Seed Bank already houses almost 40,000 wild plant species, which are stored, dried and kept at -20C in the vaults. Others around the world focus on crops, such as rice and their wild relatives. In a laboratory above the vaults, seeds collections manager, Janet Terry, is sorting through a shipment of seeds from Tanzania, which will be added to the collections. They could have value as foods, fuels or medicines. ""We don't know what's in them,"" she says. ""But the really important thing is that with our changing climate - we collect and preserve these things before they've gone - and then we can use them for any purpose we can find for them.""

,"Image copyright SSTL Image caption Sydney Harbour: The famous bridge and opera house captured at night Sydney Harbour and the Egyptian pyramids feature in the debut images from the first all-UK radar spacecraft. NovaSAR was developed jointly by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited of Guildford and Airbus in Portsmouth, and launched to orbit in September. Its pictures are now being assessed for use in diverse roles, including crop analysis, flood and forestry mapping, and maritime surveillance. The intention ultimately is to fly a constellation of NovaSAR-like sats. Such a network would enable repeat images of locations to be acquired more quickly - something that is important if changes detected in a scene require a rapid response. Reacting to an oil spill at sea would be a good example. Image copyright AIRBUS DS Image caption NovaSAR has something of the look of a cheese-grater Satellite radar's great advantage is that it sees the Earth's surface in all weathers and at night. Many other types of Earth observation (EO) spacecraft need daylight and cloud-free skies to gather their data. The picture of Sydney Harbour, with its famous bridge and opera house, illustrates this point: it was taken after dark. The image is resolving objects that are six metres across and larger. ""What interests me most in this picture are the boats,"" said Luis Gomes, the chief technology officer at SSTL. ""NovaSAR is seeing not only large vessels but also much smaller pleasure craft. We can't see the shape of them, but we can certainly see that they are there. And that's encouraging because one of the main objectives of NovSAR will be maritime surveillance,"" he told BBC News. The satellite is equipped with a receiver that can pick up Automatic Identification System (AIS) radio signals. These are the positional transmissions that large ships are obliged to broadcast under international law. Vessels that tamper with or disable these messages very often are engaged in smuggling or illegal fishing activity. If such ships appear in NovaSAR's radar pictures, they will be reported to the authorities. Image copyright SSTL Image caption Cairo: The radar picks up a range of different terrains The Cairo scene, featuring the Great Pyramids, showcases the satellite's ability to discern different land uses. The picture includes buildings, cultivated fields, trees, and desert/rock. Martin Cohen, a radar expert with Airbus, commented: ""The first image from orbit is always a key moment for everyone involved in such a mission, and this is no exception. The quality of the imagery is a credit to the hard work and dedication of the whole team here in Portsmouth. ""We look forward now to supporting SSTL through the rest of the commissioning phase, and seeing the mission begin full operational use."" There are a range of partners involved in assessing NovaSAR's capability. These include EO specialists in India and Australia. The UK's Ministry of Defence also wants to see what the spacecraft can offer Britain's armed forces. UK engineers have long worked in space radar but their technology has previously always gone on broader missions, such as those for the European Space Agency. NovaSAR, in contrast, is solely a British initiative. Science Minister Sam Gyimah is visiting SSTL on Friday. The UK government invested £21m in the project. ""Yet again we can see UK research and innovation that is truly out of this world,"" he said. ""This 'eye in the sky' can capture an image a dozen times wider than the Strait of Dover and the data it provides can help crack problems from illegal shipping to alerting us to damaging pollution that needs to be countered.""

,"Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira It's a year since movie mogul Harvey Weinstein checked himself into a sex addiction clinic after the flood of rape and sexual harassment allegations that gave rise to the Me Too movement. The BBC's Sangita Myska has been meeting people who say they've suffered from sex addiction, in order to understand whether it really exists, and if so, what it is. Neila's first job in the UK, after she arrived from Central Asia 15 years ago, was on the trading floor of a finance company dominated by what she describes as ""alpha-males, earning million-pound bonuses"". She was one of only two women on the team, and her male colleagues would sometimes try to provoke them by playing pornography on the big screens that should have been showing market data. ""I didn't like it but I was at the start of my career, making my way in the city. It was good money and a glamorous job and I didn't want to lose that,"" she says. ""I knew the men in the office were looking for a reaction - they wanted to shock me. So I started going home and watching porn videos and DVDs on my own, so I could brush it off in the office."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira But quickly Neila got hooked. Her upbringing in a socially conservative family where sex was never discussed left her ""defenceless"" she says. Every day she was thinking about how quickly she could get home to choose a film and a sex toy and start to masturbate. She describes the process for me. ""It starts slowly. You get aroused. And then you just watch and simultaneously you switch on your equipment. All your senses are stimulated, watching something so exciting. Your mind goes elsewhere. You know it's not going to stop until you press the button. You know you're in control of it, of every aspect of your pleasure, and it gives you orgasms you just can't have with another human being - and certainly not a man. ""The whole process of masturbating and coming will take you a maximum of five to 10 minutes but you pull back because you don't want to exit this state you are in, which is basically like being intoxicated."" Using this technique, called ""edging"", she was watching porn for two to three hours, seven days a week. Find out more Listen to Addicted to Sex by Sangita Myska on Radio 4 on 5 November at 20:00, repeated on 7 November at 11:00 Download the Addicted to Sex podcast - six full and very frank conversations Sangita recorded for the programme Her behaviour was compulsive, she says. If she couldn't watch porn, she craved it. She would also spend hours justifying it to herself, however detrimental it had become: ""Everything is safe, you're not going to catch an STD from watching porn, you don't have to wear make-up. Everything on your terms and with guaranteed results."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira But to continue getting those guaranteed results, the type of pornography she was watching took a darker turn. ""Usually you start watching vanilla porn - that means male-on-female or female-on-female, normal stuff - and after a while it doesn't work any more. Your body gets used to this release. It's similar to drug addiction, you need to increase the dose, so in order to increase it you watch more hardcore stuff. ""So you start watching anal, and then after a while that becomes a new normal for you so you need to watch something more hardcore and then you start searching for extreme stuff like gang bangs."" This was very uncomfortable for Neila, who began to worry that she was ""a perv"", as she puts it. This issue of shame is a big one for every person who believes they are a sex addict. Shame simultaneously makes them want to hide away and drives them further into their compulsion. ""It's a cocktail of arousal and shame,"" Neila says. Porn also changed her attitude towards men. It meant that when she looked for a potential partner, their personalities and character became almost irrelevant. ""I would look through their shirts to see if they had a six-pack,"" she says. ""The average UK penis size wasn't enough for me... but it's not a good way to choose a life partner."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira She had a series of failed relationships, but it was the fact she felt compelled to watch films featuring violence against women to get a ""high"" that really began to terrify her. ""I had to ask myself, what's next? Will I end up watching a snuff movie just to satisfy my addiction?"" she says. Neila left the City and re-trained as a counsellor. Now in her 40s, she specialises in treating other patients who believe they are sex addicts. She trained at the Laurel Centre in central London, one of only a handful of clinics in the UK providing specialist support of this kind. To get it you have to pay, sometimes hundreds of pounds per hour, because the NHS doesn't recognise sex addiction as a genuine condition. But it's estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of people seek treatment in the UK each year, the vast majority of them men. Does sex addiction exist? The World Health Organization recently added Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder to its list of recognised disorders The UK's National Health Service doesn't recognise sex addiction as an illness - and doesn't keep official statistics The NHS web page on addiction notes that addiction is most commonly associated with gambling, drugs, alcohol and nicotine - and adds: ""being addicted to something means not having it causes withdrawal symptoms"" Private clinics in the UK claim that hundreds of people, if not thousands, approach them every year for help Where to get help Part of the reason for this may be that women are more ashamed and find it harder to confess to the problem. But whatever the explanation, Paul is more typical of those seeking help for this condition - both because he's a man, and also because he got his thrills from having sex rather than watching porn. In his 50s, tall and well-dressed in a crisp white shirt and jacket, Paul tells me his addiction began 30 years ago at university. He had a loving relationship with his girlfriend but one day, it seems, that wasn't enough for him. ""I loved her, I really did but for whatever reason I went to see a prostitute,"" he says. ""I was desperate for a thrilling sexual encounter and I knew that this was something I shouldn't be doing. I'd never be unfaithful to her with another girl but this felt like something different."" Within weeks, his behaviour had changed completely. ""I had about six girlfriends on the go at the same time and I was seeing two or three sex workers a week. It's almost like ordering a pizza in because I was hungry. I want something, I order it in, I forget about it."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira He says he knew something was very wrong. But just as he began considering whether or not to confide in someone, or even get help, he landed his first job in London - and found himself in an environment where this kind of behaviour was actually encouraged. ""Life was unbelievable. Flying around the world on Concorde, earning a lot of money, frequenting the lap-dancing bars of London - you find yourself going out for a sexual thrill with the people you work with,"" Paul remembers. ""So at this point [I'm thinking] 'Maybe I haven't got a problem, maybe I'm just a normal sort of guy?'"" Even then, a nagging doubt remained at the back of Paul's mind. He would go with colleagues on a ""grand night out"" to the lap-dancing bars - so-called because each spent £1,000 per night - on a Tuesday, perhaps, and maybe again on a Thursday. But Paul would be the only one going back on a Saturday. Like Neila, Paul says he began to ""chase the high"". So much so, that despite being heterosexual, for 10 years he also had sex with men. ""I switched completely from women to men. So all my physical acting out was with men. I can honestly say that I haven't got one ounce of homosexuality in me. It's really just seeking a higher thrill, that's what it came down to. And throughout this whole period I had some very very nice girlfriends."" Again, as with Neila, Paul says his behaviour was compulsive. If he wasn't having sex, he craved it. And again it wasn't reaching orgasm that was the goal - it was the set of behaviours around it that he was hooked on. Like Neila, he would stretch out the experience for hours at a time. ""The thrill is the build-up, the anticipation of what you're going to be doing the very last thing that you want to do is to ejaculate because at that point the whole process is over."" It took Paul a long time to get hooked on porn, after first discovering it at the age of 12. ""I did come across some magazines in my parents' house. I found them hidden when my parents were out. So it was a reasonably early exposure to porn. But, if I'm honest I can't remember feeling sexual excitement."" That changed when high-speed internet arrived. At that point his focus shifted from sex workers to online porn, which he would watch for hours on end. Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira Paul has received long-term support from the Laurel Centre, and now believes he is well on the way to recovery. He has not used sex workers for several years or watched porn for months, he says. His goal is to settle down with one woman. ""It's a lonely disease You get to the point where you realise that you've got a limited amount time on the planet. I've never had an enjoyable sexual relationship with someone I care for and love. That's the one thing that's been missing for 30 years."" In June, the World Health Organization officially recognised what it calls Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder in its international classification of diseases. Therapists I've spoken to say that even though this falls short of classifying the condition as an addiction, it may encourage the UK government to provide counselling services on the NHS. In the last few weeks I have spoken to many other people who believe they are sex addicts, and I no longer believe it's important whether the condition is called an addiction or not - because all of them clearly need help to solve a problem that is wrecking their lives. When it comes to Weinstein, and the suspicion that checking into a sex addiction clinic could signal an attempt to dodge responsibility for his behaviour, the people I've spoken to understood the difference between consensual sex and rape even at the height of their compulsive behaviour. None, as far as I know, has committed a crime. In my view, sex addicts primarily hurt themselves and their partners - sex predators abuse victims and attempt to disguise it.

,"Image copyright Bloomberg Image caption Researchers gained unprecedented access to participants' phones to follow sharing behaviours A rising tide of nationalism in India is driving ordinary citizens to spread fake news, according to BBC research. The research found that facts were less important to some than the emotional desire to bolster national identity. Social media analysis suggested that right-wing networks are much more organised than on the left, pushing nationalistic fake stories further. There was also an overlap of fake news sources on Twitter and support networks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The findings come from extensive research in India, Kenya, and Nigeria into the way ordinary citizens engage with and spread fake news. Participants gave the BBC extensive access to their phones over a seven day period, allowing the researchers to examine the kinds of material they shared, who they shared it with and how often. The research, commissioned by the BBC World Service and published today, forms part of "" Beyond Fake News "" - a series across TV, radio and digital that aims to investigate how disinformation and fake news is affecting people around the world. In all three countries, distrust of mainstream news outlets pushed people to spread information from alternative sources, without attempting to verify it, in the belief that they were helping to spread the real story. People were also overly confident in their ability to spot fake news. The sheer flood of digital information being spread in 2018 is worsening the problem. Participants in the BBC research made little attempt to query the original source of fake news messages, looking instead to alternative signs that the information was reliable. These included the number of comments on a Facebook post, the kinds of images on the posts, or the sender, with people assuming WhatsApp messages from family and friends could be trusted and sent on without checking. Widespread sharing of false rumours on WhatsApp has led to a wave of violence in India, with people forwarding on fake messages about child abductors to friends and family out of a sense of duty to protect loved ones and communities. Media caption The digital epidemic killing Indians According to a separate BBC analysis, at least 32 people have been killed in the past year in incidents involving rumours spread on social media or messaging apps. We examined one case in detail - the deaths of Nilotpal and Abhishek in Assam - while another reporter travelled to Mexico to see how WhatsApp rumours fuelled similar deadly violence there. The research in Africa suggested that national identity was insignificant in the spread of fake news. In Kenya, scams related to money and technology were a stronger driving force, contributing to around a third of stories shared on WhatsApp, while fake stories relating to terrorism and the army were widely shared in Nigeria. In both countries, health scares were prominent among widely-shared fake news stories, and many news consumers visited both credible and fake news sources without distinguishing between them. Researchers spent hundreds of hours with 80 participants across the three countries, interviewing them at home about their media consumption as well as examining how they shared information via WhatsApp and Facebook during a seven-day period. They also conducted extensive analysis of how fake news spreads on Twitter and Facebook in India, to understand whether the spread of fake news was politically polarised. About 16,000 Twitter accounts and 3,000 Facebook pages were analysed. The results showed a strong and coherent promotion of right-wing messages, while left-wing fake news networks were loosely organised, if at all, and less effective. The methodology By Santanu Chakrabarti We set out with this research to try to answer the question of why ordinary citizens spread fake news - a little-understood part of the fake news equation. When a phenomenon is new or not very well understood, qualitative research techniques are useful. These techniques - in this case, in-depth interviews and up-close observation of sharing behaviours - allowed us to explore fake news with nuance, richness and depth. Because we wanted to know what was spreading in encrypted private networks like WhatsApp, ethnographic approaches - visiting people at home - were essential. This is the first known research project in these countries that uses these methods to understand the fake news phenomenon at the level of ordinary citizens. It is also the first to use data science and network analysis techniques to understand how known sources of fake news are organised on Twitter and Facebook, and what their connections are with audiences. This story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.

,"Image caption Houses in Llanelli suffered flooding on numerous occasions before the work was carried out It was the worst flooding seen for 30 years - but while all around were knee-deep in water, one town escaped. A 21-year-old man was killed in a nearby landslip, homes were flooded while transport was severely disrupted because of the amount of rain. But amid October's deluge, one town kept its properties above water despite its Victorian drainage system. Llanelli's new £95m anti-flood scheme has been hailed as the saviour that protected the Carmarthenshire town. Before the scheme was introduced, during times of heavy rain, the excess water gushed into the antiquated drainage system, causing flood water to become contaminated with sewage. This often meant that - as in the 2010 storms - that sewage water would back up in homes, causing severe damage. But a new project, known as RainScape, was introduced in 2013 which uses a series of shallow basins, channels and porous paving to help divert flood water away from the sewerage system. It does this by separating rain water from the existing system, slowing it down and redirecting it to local rivers and watercourses or into the soil. As a result, not a single home in the town was flooded, despite nearby Carmarthen being badly affected. Image copyright Angharad Lewis Image caption One of the main streets in Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire, was hit by flooding Computer modelling from Welsh Water shows that, were it not for RainScape, it was likely more than 100 homes would have been flooded. ""We have had a history of sewer flooding listed on our risk register in Llanelli,"" Teresa O'Neill, of Welsh Water told the BBC's Eye on Wales show. ""Llanelli has a combined-sewer system, collecting water from inside homes, as well as rainwater from roads and roofs. ""Now the climate is changing and it rains more heavily and more often, sometimes our sewers can't cope when this happens."" Image caption Steve Wilson, managing director of Welsh Water, in front of one of the ""planters"" used in the flood defences The project follows examples in the Swedish city of Malmo and Portland in the USA. It uses computer-based modelling - and records of previous flooding events - to predict where flooding was most likely to occur and sought to intervene. In Storm Callum, Welsh Water say it saw off 1,690 tonnes of flood water and stopped it from reaching the sewerage system. Properties in areas that commonly flood, such as Dafen and Pemberton, also remained dry. ""The RainScape scheme has been developed in recognition of the geography of Llanelli, with steep slopes coming down onto a narrow coastal strip, meaning we are susceptible to surface water,"" said local MP Nia Griffith, It is now likely to be tested again as Storm Diana hits west Wales. ""Now that this huge investment has been made, the planning committee of Carmarthenshire County Council needs to take the utmost care not to grant planning permission to developments that could flood or could increase the risk of flooding to the surrounding area,"" added Ms Griffith. From January 2019, it will be a legal requirement for all new developments in Wales to have sustainable urban drainage schemes and the country's second system will be put in place in Grangetown in Cardiff.","When the deluge came down, one coastal town escaped flooding thanks to a £95m scheme.",,2018-11-28,BBC News,How Llanelli avoided flooding during Storm Callum,

,"Media captionDog-loving Harvey finds comfort in the funny films
A terminally ill boy has been inundated with videos of animals from well-wishers after a social media post about him was seen around the world.
Harvey Hawkins, 11, is being given end of life care at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff.
A Facebook post about him meeting the Wales rugby team mentioned his love of dogs and the videos started coming in.
His mother said: ""If Harvey could talk, he would thank everyone from the bottom of his heart."" 
Harvey, from Merthyr Tydfil, has suffered from a series of complex conditions since birth.
He met the Wales team at the Principality Stadium last week, just before their Six Nations Grand Slam victory, and Noah's Ark Charity - which arranged the meeting - posted about it on social media.
Harvey's cousin, who lives in Canada, shared the post and mentioned the little boy's love of dogs - prompting the influx of more than 1,000 videos.
His mother, Jamie-Louise Wallace, said: ""We have been overwhelmed with the response and the number of videos. 
""We have had videos of people's dogs singing or saying 'hello'. We had one dog saying 'I love you', and another dog playing the piano.
""It's not just dogs. There are videos of turtles, cats, chickens, horses, snakes and fish. Messages have come in from Alaska, Australia, and Mexico.
""We are encouraging people to use #HoundsforHarvey and we hope to show Harvey every video we are sent.""
Harvey has about 30 different health conditions and, in January, was diagnosed with complete gut failure and a condition called intestinal pseudo-obstruction. 
He can no longer be fed, and the family said doctors have done all they can.
Jamie-Louise, 29, said: ""We didn't think we would run out of time so quickly, but we are now preparing to go home to spend the time we have left together with his little brother and sister.""

Harvey was also recently visited by a therapy dog called Nico.

In a see-sawing tussle, Luke O'Neill's curling 25 yard extra time free-kick put the League One club in front for the first time, and Elliott List added number four after the second half restart before Tyrone O'Neill scored a third Pools goal in the 115th minute. Tom Eaves' penalty kick with virtually the last kick of injury time had finally brought the sides level after Pools had gone 2-0 up in an excellent first-half display. Carl Magnay headed in the opener from a deep, curling free-kick and Patrick McLaughlin followed up to bury the second after Marcus Dinanga's shot was saved. Max Ehmer smashed in after the break to draw Gills back into the contest, but it looked as though their flood of pressure would be in vain until Eaves slotted home from the spot. Hartlepool boss Matthew Bates can be proud of his side for giving their higher division opponents a tough test, but this loss stretches their winless run to seven games. In front of a vibrant Victoria Park crowd, Pools survived an early scare when Eaves had a free shot in the box which Scott Loach saved and then began to impose themselves on the game. Gills goalkeeper Tomas Holy hesitated when Liam Noble swung in a free-kick, and Magnay nodded in at the back post to open the scoring. Pools soon added a second when McLaughlin steered in on the rebound. Sharp one-touch football for the remainder of the half had the visitors scrambling after shadows, but when they returned after the break the Gills finally found their form. Ehmer's shot, from a cute clipped pass by Mark Byrne gave them hope, and after bombarding the Pools box for the final 10 minutes, they eventually got their reward when Eaves buried his spot-kick following a Noble handball.

 Debris at one of the church fires in Louisiana's St. Landry Parish
The outpouring of generosity in response to the fire at Notre-Dame cathedral has led to a renewed focus on fundraising for black churches in the United States which were destroyed by an arsonist earlier this year.
On Monday as French firefighters tackled the blaze at the 850-year-old building, Louisiana resident Megan Romer tweeted her sadness over the cathedral's destruction. 
However, she also took the opportunity to divert her followers' attention to three other churches devastated by fire that did not have billionaires queuing up to save them.
Skip Twitter post by @meganromerThe GoFundMe has racked up another $20k in the past several hours, which is wonderful &amp; touching.

End of Twitter post by @meganromer
""If you are going to donate money to rebuild a church this week, I implore you to make it the black churches in St. Landry Parish,"" Ms Romer wrote. 
She was referring were three historically black churches in Louisiana that were subject to arson attacks in late March and earlier this month. St Mary Baptist Church, the Greater Union Baptist Church and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church were razed to the ground. 
When Ms Romer wrote her appeal, the fundraising page of the three churches was far short of its $1.8m goal - with fewer than $100,000 raised. 
While acknowledging the huge importance of the French cathedral, she wrote: ""Remember that famous history isn't the only history. Imagine the courage it took to build and fill a black house of worship in post-bellum rural Louisiana. And now.""
She also reminded people that the parish had been the site of the deadly Opelousas massacre in 1868.
Since Monday, her tweet has been shared more than 37,000 times as word spread all over social media. Influential figures like Hillary Clinton and CNN anchor Jake Tapper pushed the fundraising page to their followers.

""The rebuild of Notre-Dame will be well-funded,"" wrote journalist Yashar Ali, who donated $1,000 to the fund. 
On Wednesday, total donations for the three churches passed $1m with more than 18,000 people donating.
""It shows that the church is not only fireproof, but it's also faith-proof,"" Pastor Mason Jack told local news channel News15. ""To get calls from New York, and across the country and to show love for our sister churches means a whole lot to us,"" he said.

 Floods have swept through Iran in the past few weeks, killing at least 45 people
Iran has ordered the evacuation of about 70 villages in the south-western province of Khuzestan due to a growing risk of floods, state media report. 
At least 45 people have died in the past two weeks after heavy rains, with flooding affecting at least 23 of the country's 31 provinces. 
The orders come as Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused US sanctions of impeding aid efforts to affected areas.
""This isn't just economic warfare; it's economic terrorism,"" Mr Zarif tweeted.
US sanctions imposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year have caused a shortage of rescue helicopters.
The Iranian authorities have requested military assistance, including helicopters and amphibious armoured personnel carriers, to help with rescue efforts.
Evacuation orders were issued to seventy villages near the Dez and Karkheh rivers in the oil-rich province of Khuzestan, the governor of Shush country told the official Irna news agency. 
Storms forecast for the coming days are predicted to affect the west and southwest of the country.
Tens of thousands of people have already been displaced, with many being housed in emergency shelter, according to state media.
Two more people died in Hamedan province on Tuesday, Irna said, citing an official from the Red Crescent aid agency.
Authorities in the western province of Lorestand brought in the armed forces to evict those who did not comply with the evacuation order.
Governor General Mousa Khademi told the Isna news agency that they had lost all contact with the town of Pol-e Dokhtar.
""We do not have any information on the situation there,"" he said, adding that they did not know how many people had been affected.

 Many thousands of illegal miners across Africa risk their lives looking for gold
At least 23 gold panners in Zimbabwe are feared to have drowned underground after heavy rains flooded two mines.
Police said rescue teams were trying to pump out the water and search for bodies and any survivors at the mines near the town of Kadoma. 
The two mines, called Silver Moon Mine and Cricket Mine, are run by registered companies, according to local media.
But the illegal workers are said to have gone underground late on Tuesday without the owners' knowledge. 
Heavy rain then destroyed a dam wall, causing the floods.
A total of 38 artisanal miners went underground across the two mines, state broadcaster ZBC reported.
It's the third deadly mine disaster to hit the continent in a fortnight.

A stranded motorist in Mozambique spent days trying to get from the port city of Beira to his home in Chimoio in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, which has destroyed towns and villages in its path and left floods of up to six metres deep.
Graham Taylor, a Zimbabwean agriculture and forestry adviser who has lived in Mozambique's Manica province for 10 years, had gone to Beira on Friday to help his son with emergency repairs. He told the BBC about his return journey and the scenes he witnessed days before any aid agencies arrived.
I left Beira on Saturday at around 9am, about an hour and a half out going west to Chimoio, I encountered huge flood waters crossing this main newly built highway - vast amounts of water half a metre deep, six to seven kilometres wide.
I managed to get through this and reached a little sugar town called Lamego. It was here that I became stranded, as ahead it turned out was a further seven kilometres of flooded road, and where I witnessed the most horrific scene.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Hundreds of thousands of people have been affected by the floods
About 95% of the houses had been levelled and destroyed, especially those constructed out of poles and mud. If there was a roof remaining, people were on it. There were people on roof tops and trees - families, kids and babies on trees as far as the eye could see.
'Saving lives with rope and plastic containers'
For two full days there was absolutely no sign of any assistance anywhere, except for one young white gentleman who lived in Lamego, he may have been with the American Peace Corp.
He had managed to get two 100m length ropes and a lot of empty 20-litre yellow plastic bottles, the containers in which cooking oil is sold.
He threaded a rope through the handle of the bottles and using a little boat made of tree bark, he took the rope to a building, tied it to a window frame and then the people climbed out of the building and held on to the floating rope.
He had 10 people working with him and they ushered people along these two ropes in the water. Once the people were off that building they would take the rope to a tree or another building - a slow process until they reached safety.
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Plastic containers like these were tied to the ropes in Lamego to save people
For a solid 48 hours while I was there they never stopped working - throughout the night, they had the vehicle lights shining on the rope and the people. It was a human train of people being ushered and assisted to safety. He did a fantastic job. 
This was in a 1,000m radius around him - but my biggest concern was the remaining 200 sq km of flood plain heading in the direction of the Buzi and the Pungwe rivers - that's where most communities live, they reside on the banks of the river.
The depth of the water by the road was three or four metres deep - flowing water. In the distance there was just the most enormous volume of water - a lake, it's just too big to comprehend.
'Walking by cell phone light'
I had tried to go back to Beira on Saturday but by midday the road had been totally washed away behind me. I sat it out for two nights, sleeping in the car accompanied by two Zimbabwean truck drivers who were also stranded and we strategised together, and we would try and walk through the water, but it was not possible.
After two days the water had subsided a fair bit so we left at 0300, walking with hundreds of other members of the local community moving to safety. 
As we walked using a torch on our cell phones we heard crying and sobbing continually for a solid 10 to 15km stretch.
People were mourning as dead bodies were being washed up against the side of the road. We approximated between us that we saw between 200 and 350 bodies, including children - it was really sad.
When I saw that I just said to myself: ""How many more people are dead way inland?""
Surprisingly, we met quite a number of families coming back looking for missing relatives.
I saw things that really humbled me, elderly ladies carrying their husbands for kilometres through flood water - that's physically demanding - and how everyone was helping everyone. 
We were talking to people along the road, and asking: ""Why are you still staying here?"" And they would say: ""No I'm waiting, I'm missing family. I'm looking for the bodies."" 
Some were trying to rescue small amounts of corn that was remaining but most of the crops on the flood plain had not matured so they were not ready to harvest. 
'Massive deforestation'
After seven hours and 25km we reached a little town called Nhamatanda. It was overpopulated with people who had been affected by the floods - there was transport and buses taking them further inland up the road for safety. I caught the local little buses and hopped along all the way to Chimoio.
More on Cyclone Idai:
Where we were, we didn't see any sign of crocodiles - there are a lot of crocodiles in the upper reaches of the Pungwe but this flood came from the Buzi river, so they would probably not be in these flood plains. There are never floods here - speaking to a 90-year-old man on the side of the road, he said this hadn't happened in 90 years.

 Huge swathes of Mozambique remain under water
There is massive deforestation taking place in Mozambique now and this is part of the cause of the problem. Also rural communities cultivate and have vegetable gardens right on the banks of the river and in the river beds. There needs to be projects funded that use solar-powered drip irrigation schemes that can work 100m or 50m away from the river.

 Workers left the site after the meeting
Construction company Dawnus has gone into administration, according to subcontractors.
People who work for the Swansea-based firm were called to a meeting on Thursday morning.
But they were sent home afterwards, and could be seen removing tools from the site.
It comes after work on the £12m Kingsway redevelopment in Swansea and a road project in Manchester were both halted.
Powys council said three school building projects could be delayed as a result, including one which is scheduled for completion in September. 
Dawnus - which runs construction projects across the UK and overseas - has been contacted repeatedly by the BBC but has not commented.
However, people leaving the Swansea meeting said they had been told the firm had gone into administration.
On Tuesday, the road project in Manchester was stopped, with diggers abandoned as workers claimed they had not been paid by Dawnus Ltd.
The following day, workers in Swansea were sent home by their bosses.

 Dawnus has been contacted repeatedly by the BBC but has not commented
Dawnus has its headquarters in Swansea but runs construction projects across the UK and overseas.
Among its past projects across the UK were the Great Western Air Ambulance Charity and National Police Air Service Air Operations in South Gloucestershire, a creative industries centre at Kingston College in London, and South Wokingham Secondary School in Berkshire. 
Dawnus has previously operated in Liberia and Senegal in west Africa. 
It won awards for its work at Tata steelworks in Port Talbot and Monmouthshire Housing Association. 
Among Dawnus's other projects in Wales are the £5.6m Roath flood risk management scheme in Cardiff, Bont Evans tree works and stabilisation in Machynlleth, Powys, and St Asaph flood defence works, Denbighshire.
The most recent company accounts show the company had a turnover of £170m in 2017, but it also posted a pre-tax loss of £1.35m. 
However last September, the company said it employed 700 people and was optimistic about the future.
In Powys, Dawnus Construction has contracts to build three new schools - two new primary schools in Welshpool, and a replacement for the county's first all-through school Ysgol Bro Hyddgen in Machynlleth.
 One of the primary schools is scheduled for completion in September while the other two projects have not yet started work. 
""The council has not received any formal contact from the company. Dawnus is a key partner in a number of our school modernisations projects and we will be working to mitigate any potential issues which arise,"" said Councillor Myfanwy Alexander, cabinet member for learning and Welsh language.
Meanwhile, businesses in Swansea said they were concerned about having a building site remaining in the city centre.
Mark Hanford, co-owner of of Boosh Salon, said it was ""disappointing"" that there will be ""more disruption"" to the area.
""Any business in Swansea has already taken a hit,"" he told BBC Radio Wales.
Mr Hanford added that although he has contacted Swansea council, there had not been given any reassurances about the future.
David Price, finance editor of Construction News, said there had been rumours Dawnus was facing trouble after reports of losses.
""In 2014-2015 they made significant losses of around £13m, connected to work in Africa, and they have struggled to recover from that since then,"" he said.

""I asked Flood how long it was going to take me to 'make it' - he said 'At least a decade',"" she explains. ""For me the tea-making route felt like the easiest one but there's so many courses and avenues in music. We're all just a bunch of nerds."" That first job taught her ""the fundamentals"" of production and led her to work outside of Flood's studio with The Futureheads.

""At the end he asked what I thought. I go 'Well, would you be interested in doing it again?' and he said 'No'. ""So I told him 'In that case it's amazing'.

As the clock ticks closer towards the deadline of midnight on 31 January to complete self-assessment tax returns, nearly two million people are estimated to have left it until the last minute.
Last year almost 750,000 people faced a fine of £100 by being late.
Some of those had imaginative (and unsuccessful) excuses for their tardiness. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has revealed some of the ""outlandish"" reasons they heard last year:
My mother-in-law is a witch and put a curse on me
I'm too short to reach the post box
I was just too busy - my first maid left, my second maid stole from me, and my third maid was very slow to learn
Our junior member of staff registered our client in self assessment by mistake because they were not wearing their glasses
My boiler had broken and my fingers were too cold to type

 HMRC has been running an awareness campaign
HMRC said it would provide help for those who had a genuine excuse for not submitting their return on time. 
Those could include the death of a partner or family member, serious illness, fire, flood or theft, computer failure or issues with HMRC online services.
But as the deadline for 2017/18 tax returns fast approaches, some people just can't help leaving it until the pressure is really on.
Skip Twitter post by @CraigPatonThe HMRC should have a prize for those who fill out their tax returns with the least amount of time to spare before the deadline. I think I could be in with a chance of winning that.

Others admit procrastination is to blame.
If that applies to you here are some tips for procrastinators, from productivity expert Moyra Scott:
Try to minimise interruptions like email notifications. Putting your phone on airplane mode or going somewhere to work where you won't be disturbed will also help
Being ""busy"" is easier than doing the thing we are avoiding. Instead of doing the task at hand, we do other stuff instead and kid ourselves that we don't have the time. You do have the time. You just need to make it
HMRC has been reminding people that if their tax return is late, they will receive the penalty even if they do not owe any tax.
And the longer the delay, the bigger the penalty.

 The council has until the end of the month to give a written response to the public inquiry
A council has told a public inquiry the case for approving a £25m flood protection project in Dumfries is ""clear, compelling and detailed"".
In its closing submission it said there was no ""valid, relevant or significant"" reason to reject the Whitesands plan.
Campaigners against the scheme have said that ""massive doubts"" remain about the proposals.
The inquiry will decide whether to approve, modify or reject the project later this year.
Closing submissions formally bring the proceedings to an end in the hearing which started in November last year.
A full report will now be compiled but that is likely to take at least two months.

 Part of the A93, west of Ballater collapsed in during the 2016 floods
The number of Scottish homes and businesses considered at risk of flooding has more than doubled in three years.
The new National Flood Risk Assessment estimates that around 284,000 properties are vulnerable to rising river and sea levels. 
This compares with 108,000 found to be under threat in 2011 and 2015.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said it now had a better picture of the scale of the problem.
Steve McFarland, of Sepa's flood risk planning and policy team, said the rise in the figure for ""at risk"" homes was largely down to improved modelling and knowledge, rather than an increased physical risk
But he also warned of the impact of climate change. 
'Better understanding'
He said: ""This is our best understanding yet of flood risk in Scotland, with a wider and more detailed national picture than ever before.
""Scientific knowledge and understanding of flood risk is constantly evolving. Better data and access to improved mapping and modelling has advanced our understanding of the location of properties at risk. 
""This means Sepa and its partners are better able to reduce the risk to people, properties, businesses, communities, infrastructure and the environment from the potential impact of future increased flooding.""
The latest assessment predicted the problem will get worse with climate change which, by 2080, is set to increase the numbers at risk by 110,000. 
This equates to one in eight homes and one in five businesses, compared to one in 11 homes and one in seven businesses at present.
Image caption
 The floods caused misery in some Ballater homes
Mr McFarland added: ""Homeowners, businesses and communities need to recognise their risk, get prepared and take action to help reduce the impact that flooding has on their life.""
Technology has allowed experts to build a more comprehensive picture of the problem and the latest figures take into account more than just an address.
For example, complex sites like universities, which would previously have been counted as one property, have multiple buildings and workshops.
Sepa said hazard maps, based on intelligence from local communities, have also been updated to identify new vulnerable areas.
When Storm Frank hit Scotland around Hogmanay 2015, it caused widespread flooding across the country. 
More than 100 flood warnings were issued and Sepa's 24/7 contact centre received over 3,300 calls.

 Some roads in Ballater were completely under water
In Ballater in Aberdeenshire, more than 300 properties were affected when the River Dee burst its banks and the final flooding bill ran into millions.
David Cobban and his wife Wendy run the Brakeley Gift Room which was flooded just 12 weeks after it opened.
He recalled: ""There was already about four feet of water in the shop by the time we arrived in the morning and it wiped out 100% of our stock. 
""So we had to strip everything back the bare stone and refurbish.""
The Aberdeen-based quantity surveyor said the shop was unable to trade for four months.
He added: ""People in the village went out of their way to come to the shop and the local community was really supportive of all the businesses in Ballater. That really helped. 
""There's a lot more liaison now between retailers and businesses in the village and I think we're probably trading better than ever.""
Emergency flood kit
The Cobbans signed up for free flood warnings from Sepa's Floodline in the aftermath of Storm Frank and made other winter readiness preparations.
These included fitting flood gates, with expanding seals, to the shop's three doorways. 
Ballater also created its own Flood Resilience Group to help alert and support local businesses and residents during times of heightened risk.
Sepa has been working with the Scottish government, local authorities and other partners to help assess and manage the impact of flooding through the National Flood Risk Assessment, which was first published in December 2011.
As well as signing up for free Floodline messages the agency encourages people to leave their home or business well protected if they are away.

A Scottish Bakery was fined £6,000 on Tuesday over the April 2018 incident. 
Mr Bingham and his wife, from Holywood, County Down, checked the ingredients on the label but they did not list eggs.
Nevis Bakery who are based in Inverness-shire pleaded guilty to not referring to the presence of eggs in its Empire Biscuits.

Authorities in Townsville, Australia have warned residents to beware of crocodiles and snakes spotted in floodwaters in residential areas.
More than 1,100 people have been evacuated from the town amid a ""once in a century"" flood.
On Sunday, the city authorities released a dam which had swollen to double its capacity following a week of record rainfall.
Authorities have said more heavy rain is expected in coming days.
Up to 20,000 homes are at risk of being inundated.

Emergency workers and the army said they had received more than 1,000 calls for help. They've been using boats and helicopters to move people to higher ground.
""Crocodiles may be seen crossing roads, and when flooding recedes, crocodiles can turn up in unusual places such as farm dams or waterholes,"" said Queensland's Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch.
""Similarly, snakes are very good swimmers and they too may turn up unexpectedly.""
One local resident, Erin Hahn, shared pictures of a crocodile sitting in shallow water at the end of her father's drive. Another was photographed climbing a tree in the floodwater. 
Local police also warned people of other dangers in the floodwater, including leaking sewage.
Townsville has received more than a metre (3.3ft) of rain in the past week - more than 20 times the average for the time of year.
""This is unprecedented, we've never seen anything like this before,"" said Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.

 Tariffs will remain on Chinese ceramic products
Chinese car tyres, steel products and ceramic goods will continue to be penalised after Brexit, under trade remedy measures announced by the government.
The European Union applies tariffs to imports that have been judged to be traded unfairly.
The UK government said that 43 such remedies to trading will be maintained.
They will be continued if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement or after the transition period.
Chinese products in particular have been penalised for being dumped on international markets at low prices.
The International Trade Secretary Liam Fox also announced that 66 measures designed to protect European Union producers will not apply after Brexit.
That includes tariffs on Thai sweetcorn, mandarins from China and solar glass from China, used to make solar panels.
""The decision on whether to maintain measures was based on whether those measures mattered to the UK. We are scrapping measures that don't significantly benefit British businesses and this will see savings for people throughout the country,"" Mr Fox said in a statement.
He added that there would be a review of the tariffs to see if they needed changing.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The ceramics industry is concerned about trading conditions after Brexit
""What's crucial is what's missing from the Government's announcement today,"" said Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation.
""We still do not know what they are going to do with those underlying, most favoured nation tariffs, onto which trade remedies are added. 
""If Government drops these to zero in a no-deal Brexit, then ceramic tiles and tableware, and many thousands of other goods manufactured in this country will be in jeopardy, because a flood of imports will cause untold damage to our domestic markets,"" she said.
'Mammoth task'
The body representing steel makers welcomed the trade remedies announced today, but warned that the UK is not ready to manage trade issues.
""Even a highly experienced authority would struggle with the sheer volume and complexity of reviewing all the transitioned measures, implementation of the UK's new steel safeguards as well as taking on a brand new investigations into dumping and subsidies,"" said the Director General of UK Steel Gareth Stace.
""UK steel producers are at risk of exposure to unfair trading practises whilst the fledgling Trade Remedies Authority wrestles with this mammoth task and plays catch-up with its EU counterpart,"" he said.

 International Trade Secretary Liam Fox
In 2017, Mr Fox said the UK would be able to replicate 40 EU free trade deals by Brexit day.
But so far the department has only been able to finalise continuity agreements with seven of the 69 countries and regions with which the EU has trade deals.
These include Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, Eastern and Southern Africa, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
Last week it emerged that a deal with Japan would not be read in time for a no-deal Brexit.
It was one of the most important EU trade deals the UK hoped to replicate ahead of the 29 March withdrawal date.
The trade department also said it would not be able to roll over the EU's customs union deal with Turkey on time.
WTO options
If the UK left the European Union on 29 March without a deal, it would automatically fall back on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
The average EU tariff is low, about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but in some sectors tariffs can be quite high.
The UK could choose to lower tariffs or waive them altogether, in an attempt to stimulate free trade. That could mean some cheaper products coming into the country for consumers but it could also risk driving some UK producers out of business.

Don't be fooled by the Japanese characters emblazoned on its hoodies - Superdry was always a thoroughly British success story. 
From a small stall in Cheltenham market, it went on to become a truly global phenomenon and a commercial success. 
But 16 years after its founding, the firm started by James Holder and Julian Dunkerton is on the decline. 
Its shares have lost more than 70% over the past year. In December it issued a profit warning, and last week the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs.
Now the blame game is playing out in public.
'Misguided strategy'
The fallout began when Mr Dunkerton stepped down from the firm's board, in March of 2018. At the time, he departed quietly enough, citing ""other demands on his time"".
But as Superdry's fortunes began to worsen, the multi-millionaire found his voice. 
He criticised the retailer's ""misguided strategy"" - including a reduction in stock both in stores and online - which he claimed he had always predicted would fail miserably. 
Instead, he wanted Superdry to focus more on the jackets and hoodies that made it famous, and offer a far wider range of variations on the web.
Mr Dunkerton also dismissed Superdry's caution late last year that it was losing business due a prolonged spell of good weather in many of its key markets, causing customers to delay purchases of warmer clothing. Rival brands, he argued, had fared better, while facing similar economic conditions. 
Yet as Julie Palmer, a partner at consultancy firm Begbies Traynor points out, falling profits in retail ""has not been a problem exclusively experienced by Superdry"".
Big chains, she argues, ""are no longer in a position to bend the will of the customer to their own styles"".
Image caption
 Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003
Winter of discontent
Superdry's styles have been at the heart of Mr Dunkerton's battle with the board.
The firm says he oversaw the Autumn/Winter 2018 range, which subsequently flopped. 
But Mr Dunkerton claims he was cut out of the design process, and never signed off on the collection. 
Regardless of who was responsible for that particular decision, Superdry's brand was on the wane, according to fashion retail analyst Kate Hardcastle. 
Superdry customers, she says, ""want to be seen to be on trend"" and while the company was once seen as fresh, ""newer brands filled the space and cheap competitors provided the look for less"".
Its rise, she adds, ""was hugely motivated by influencers, who have moved on to other products"". 
To make matters worse, Ms Hardcastle says, Superdry's bold branding is an ""easy target"" for counterfeiters, in a similar way that the Burberry check was vulnerable in the 1990s.
Image copyrightReuters
Both Mr Dunkerton and Superdry disagree - they see plenty of scope for the brand to regain its cool.
But Ms Hardcastle says the company expanded too quickly, and in an attempt to maximise the brand's potential, it may have ""diluted its appeal"".
""When something is a must-have, you have to be careful not to flood the market,"" she tells the BBC. 
""Soon it becomes commonplace and everyone wants the new best thing."" 
Mr Dunkerton remains Superdry's biggest shareholder with an 18.5% stake.
His aim now is to convince fellow shareholders to believe in his ability to turn the company around, and to bring him back into the boardroom.
Mr Dunkerton's return may not be the ""silver bullet"" the company needs, says Julie Palmer, but she predicts that while Superdry bosses have labelled his bid ""extremely damaging"", shareholders ""may yet flex their muscles"".
""A change back to what was successful before could be tempting, especially in a climate where we see high profile administrations on an almost weekly basis,"" she says.",The blame game over the decline of the British retailer is playing out in public.,,2019-03-12,BBC News,What went wrong at Superdry?,

 Some new build homes are making owners feel like 'ripped-off cash cows'
Paying unexpected costs on new-build homes has been dubbed the next PPI scandal waiting to happen, and has homeowners and MPs alike wanting solutions.
But how safe from the charges are you?
Owners of leasehold properties, for example, are finding out that while a brand new home may look like a dream, it could turn into a nightmare.
As they only own the building, not the land it is built on, they can be charged expensive ground rent and other fees which might make their homes difficult to sell in future.
But freeholders, who own their homes and the land they're built on, aren't immune from the problem either. 
Imagine owning a new home on a new estate - along with the land - but having to pay annual fees anyway. That's when freehold becomes ""fleecehold"", critics say.
What is the problem?
Leasehold owners can end up paying money - including fees for altering the building - to the party which owns the land, often the house builder. 
While freehold owners might seem exempt at first glance, they can still sign contracts which see them forking out annual maintenance fees for the upkeep of the wider, fledgling neighbourhood.
These ""estate fees"" emerge when a local council decides not to adopt the new area, leaving the builder - or more likely a third party management company - with responsibility for roads and green spaces.
Freeholders saddled with the charges say it's effectively a second tax on top of the one they already pay to local authorities.
They say it's doubly frustrating because the estate for which they pay a private company is nevertheless public space, which can be used by anybody.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 New build, new problems?
Criticism ranges from alleged mis-selling to a lack of clear information for prospective buyers about what might lie ahead.
Whether freeholder or leaseholder, those liable for charges say they are in a tenant-landlord relationship, despite their new-build homes putting them on the property ladder. 
""I feel abused and ripped off""
Image caption
 Terry Stringer is angry about maintenance charges
Freeholder Terry Stringer moved on to the Church Meadow estate in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in 2015. He calls it ""probably the worst mistake of my life"".
He pays money to SDL, the company that took over responsibility for the estate from housebuilder Bovis. And the fees are rising.
Mr Stringer says he's seen the maintenance bill go from £12,000, shared across 80 estate homes, to £32,000 - £400 per household per year.
He said: ""I just wish I wasn't here, I wish I was in the old house.
""I feel abused, ripped off.""
Mr Stringer also feels the price hike has not improved a site he sees as poorly maintained. ""We were told all of these wonderful things about what was happening and how much it was going to cost us and it hasn't transpired.""

 A resident of Church Meadow estate in Bromsgrove says he wishes he had never moved
He wants the council to take over, especially as ""everybody in the country can use this place"".
But Bromsgrove District Council says it can only take on the land at the builder's request, and has not been asked.
Meanwhile, SDL says there is still work to be done on the development and it liaises with all stakeholders to inform them of actions being taken.
Freeholder Halima Ali has lived on Rochdale's Newbold Hall Drive estate for four years.
She faces a £150 annual fee to live there but has refused to pay it, saying the estate's shared spaces are of inadequate standard.
Her fears, though, run deeper.
Image caption
 Freeholders still liable for additional fees call the situation 'fleecehold'
She thinks the practice - which makes ""cash cows"" out of homeowners - is not only a dereliction of council duty, but one that leaves residents with potentially unsellable homes.
""Once this scandal becomes more well known, you can imagine how the value of our homes will drop. This is simply unacceptable. 
""Our home for the average person is one of our biggest investments and it should not be the case that a third party has an interest in our property.""
The private company managing Newbold Hall Drive was contacted for comment. The estate's builder Persimmon said: ""The residents are legally obliged to pay the fees and have the right and ability to change the management company should they be unhappy with the costs and service provided.""
How can you avoid these costs?
Those already in the situation cannot avoid them - they are subject to binding contracts between builders and maintenance companies. 
The key is to be armed with information about the situation before entering into it.
But that is not as simple as it sounds and a shortfall in clear information on costs and obligations is something campaigners are worried about.

 What protection is there against a hike in fees?
There also seems little protection against a hike in estate fees. 
Helen Goodman, Labour MP for Bishop Auckland, is seeking to raise the profile of freeholders' plight and wants a cap on the charges. She says freeholders have no legal recourse in the event of a dispute.
Campaign group Home Owners Rights Network (HorNet) claims 478 estates - with 87,000 households - are in dispute with management firms.
One breakthrough might come by way of local authorities adopting the neighbourhoods that spring up where there were none before.
Image caption
 Dr Matt Cole says residents seem to have little control of rising fees or ways out of their agreements
However, a local government expert from the University of Birmingham says that would buck a trend. According to Dr Matt Cole ""councils are quite happy not to add to their burden of work"".
The House Builders Federation says councils are even refusing to adopt land, leaving people reliant on the private sector for services publicly delivered to others.
Is anything being done?
Where leaseholders are concerned, there's been some movement.
This week, a group of MPs concluded leaseholders in new builds were treated as a source of profit, adding claims of mis-selling should be investigated.
The Communities and Local Government Committee (HCLG) also wants a standardised key features document to be developed for would-be buyers at the start of the sales process.
That's because, it said, ""it is clear that many of the leaseholders we heard from were not aware of the differences between freehold and leasehold at the point of purchase"".

 Helen Goodman said the ""trickle"" of complaints about maintenance charges has become a ""flood""
Meanwhile, Helen Goodman MP, with a focus on freeholders' problems, says homeowners' complaints have gone from a ""trickle"" to a ""flood"".

 Thomas Jones, 18, went missing in the early hours of 19 September
A student who was found dead in a river was ""more than likely"" responding to a cry for help, an inquest heard.
Thomas Jones, 18, disappeared nine days before his body was recovered from the River Severn in Worcester in September.
CCTV cameras near where he was last seen picked up a cry for help moments before he apparently slipped and fell down an embankment at around 03.50 BST.
Coroner Geraint Williams recorded an open verdict, but said he was satisfied the student drowned.
Image caption
 Thomas Jones's parents Vicki and Ian said the past few months had been ""unbearably difficult""
The 30-minute hearing at Worcestershire Coroner's Court heard West Bromwich Albion fan Mr Jones had an alcohol level in his system which would have meant he was a little over twice the drink-drive limit.
Police officer Chris Buffery, who gave evidence at the inquest, said he could not be certain but it was likely the University of Worcester student had either gone to help another person or gone to the river to urinate.
But the coroner said Mr Jones was ""exactly the sort of person who would have seen if he could have helped"".
Mr Williams appeared to become upset as he looked at a photograph of Mr Jones before recording the conclusion.
He said: ""I have been doing this job for 30 years and it still gets to me.
""We do not have any sufficient evidence to say that this was an accident or indeed anything else.
""From what I said I think it is likely your boy heard someone calling for help and went to see if he could help.""

 Floral tributes were left on Sabrina Bridge
Speaking after the inquest, Mr Jones's father Ian said: ""The past few months have been unbearably difficult to come to terms with life without Tom and we very much appreciate the overwhelming support and respect from all involved, including the media, during this time and trust this will remain whilst we continue to rebuild our lives and work around the devastating loss of Tom."" 
Mr Jones was starting a primary teaching course and had moved to the city from his home in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, on 16 September.
He was thought to have crossed the footbridge, near to Worcester Racecourse, at about 03:50 on 19 September, and walked on to a footpath that runs along the top of flood defences.
His body was recovered from the river on 29 September.

 Many of the civilians who have fled the fighting in Hajin are living at the al-Hol camp
Fifteen displaced Syrian children - 13 of them aged under one - have died in recent weeks due to cold weather and inadequate medical care, the UN says.
Eight deaths have been reported at the Rukban camp on Jordanian border, where some 45,000 people are stranded.
The other children died while fleeing fighting between US-backed forces and Islamic State militants in the eastern Hajin area of Deir al-Zour province.
Bad weather has also wreaked havoc in Syrian refugee communities in Lebanon. 
Several days of strong winds, heavy rain and snow last week caused flooding and damage at more than 360 makeshift sites hosting 11,300 refugees. 
An eight-year-old refugee girl was swept away by a flood in the northern town of Minieh, while at least 600 refugees had to be relocated in the Bekaa valley.
Media captionRefugee homes under water
The UN children's agency, Unicef, said the extreme cold and lack of medical care for mothers before and during birth, as well as for new infants, had exacerbated the already dire conditions at Rukban camp, where 80% of the population are women and children.
Families seeking safety amid the heavy violence in Hajin had meanwhile faced difficulties leaving the conflict zone and had been left waiting in the cold for days without shelter or basic supplies, it added.
""The lives of babies continue to be cut short by health conditions that are preventable or treatable,"" warned Geert Cappelaere, Unicef's Middle East regional director. ""There are no excuses for this in the 21st century. This tragic manmade loss of life must end now.""
""Without reliable and accessible healthcare, protection and shelter, more children will die day in, day out in Rukban, Deir al-Zour and elsewhere in Syria. History will judge us for these entirely avoidable deaths.""
Mr Cappelaere said the need for assistance in Rukban was ""beyond urgent"" and called ""on all sides"" to urgently facilitate a humanitarian convoy so lifesaving supplies and services can be delivered.
People have been stranded since 2015 at Rukban, a cluster of more than 10,000 makeshift tents and mud huts in Syria's remote eastern desert, just north of a raised sand barrier where the Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi borders meet.
The camp's residents want to cross into Jordan, but the kingdom sealed the crossing near Rukban in 2016 after six soldiers were killed in a bomb attack.

It also said its fire engines were having to pump flood water away in order to protect properties in Sowerby Bridge and Todmorden. 
The Environment Agency, which issues flood warnings in England, said river levels were high and flooding was expected in some areas after persistent heavy rain. 
It said on Twitter: ""Our teams are out on the ground operating flood defences and installing temporary flood barriers to keep communities safe.""
A flood warning is more severe than a flood alert and means immediate action is required as flooding is expected. 
However, it is not as serious as a severe flood warning which means there could be a danger to life.

Newcastle have England international Mark Wilson, Simon Hammersley and Andrew Davidson back for their crucial Premiership fixture against Leicester.

Leicester have named a star-packed side in their bid to avoid being dragged into danger, with Manu Tuilagi, George Ford and Ellis Genge involved.
Graham Kitchener and Matt Smith both play their 150th Premiership games.
The Tigers are one of the most successful outfits in English rugby history - with 10 titles, two Heineken Cups and John Player and Tetley Cup wins - but this season has been one of struggle.

""Invariably when you get a game like this it doesn't turn out to be a humdinger in the way that anyone would like it to be, but there will passion and intensity on show.""
Richards' presence is one of many shared links between the two sides, with ex-Tigers Toby Flood, Calum Green, Vereniki Goneva, Logovi'i Mulipola and George McGuigan all involved for Newcastle.

The storm hit one of the worst places
The storm first struck Beira - Mozambique's fourth-largest city and a port that sits on the mouth of the River Pungwe.
Its geography, with parts of it lying below sea level, makes it vulnerable to extreme weather.
The city bore the brunt of the storm, which caused flooding, knocked down buildings and engulfed roads. A large dam also burst, cutting off the last road into the city. The hospital has also been damaged.

Beira airport, which was partially damaged by the storm and temporarily shut, has reopened and is operating as the relief operations hub. 
Air force personnel from Mozambique and South Africa have also been drafted in to fly rescue missions and distribute aid while roads are out of action.
Aid workers in the area say they have only two to three days of clean water left.
Cyclone Idai was powerful
Idai was one of the worst tropical cyclones ever to hit Africa and the southern hemisphere.
It formed off the eastern coast of Mozambique in early March and hit the country's coast a first time before heading back out into the Mozambique Channel. 
It intensified, weakened and intensified again before hitting the Mozambique coast for a second time on 14 March.
Winds reached up to 177 km/h (106 mph) and heavy rainfall caused disastrous flooding across a number of countries.
Communities have been destroyed
Vast swathes of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe have been affected.
In Mozambique, the country hardest hit, an estimated 600,000 people have been affected, according to the UN.

However, the WFP believes 1.7 million people in the country will eventually need help as a result of the disaster.
Poorer areas, made up of makeshift homes, in Beira and elsewhere have been particularly badly hit.
In Zimbabwe, 200,000 people have been affected, with most of the damage occurring near the Mozambique border.
The situation in the eastern district of Chimanimani ""is very bad"", WFP spokesman Herve Verhoosel said.
""Some 90% of the district has been significantly damaged,"" he added.
In Malawi, the UN says more than 80,000 people have been displaced.

 A family summer house on the shores of Lake Ontario, US, has been completely covered in ice
Turbulent waves and high winds have turned a family beach home into an ""ice house"" at Ramona Beach, in Pulaski, New York.
Maureen Whelan's family has used the house for the past 85 years, but none of them has ever seen anything like this before. 
Maureen shares the house with her brother and sister, and together they have been trying to chip the ice off the roof. 
""We're devastated"" she told the BBC. 
High winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) created massive waves from Lake Ontario, which blew spray onto the houses and then froze in the chilly temperatures.
This is what the house looked like before it was covered in ice.

 The house at Ramona Beach, on the shore of Lake Ontario, has been used by Maureen's family for 85 years
Maureen said the family have been creating channels so the ice can drain properly once melting occurs, in the hope of minimising water damage.
She says the property is not in a flood zone so insurance may not cover any damage. 
The home has a lakefront barrier which helped to protect it but there is four feet of ice in front of the house. 
""They're all smiling and making the best of an unfortunate situation"" says local reporter John Kucko in a Facebook post.
""We're the fourth generation to live in this house"" said Maureen. 
""This house holds many generations of memories. We're not wealthy people.""
She said they've used pumps inside, following the advice of local people: ""We're going up with chainsaws this weekend."" 
People living next to Lake Ontario have been experiencing extremely cold weather conditions. 
BBC Weather presenter Nick Miller said: ""Strong winds have blown water and spray from Lake Ontario onto the house which has then frozen producing a layer of ice. 
""It seems this weather pattern has continued long enough for the layer of ice to become unusually thick.""
""Destructive lake""
People have been sending messages of support to the family on social media.
Mary Lee Boardway-Keding told the family: ""Wow, having grown up in Oswego, and my parents having a place at Brennan's Beach I know how destructive the lake can be but I have never seen anything like this. 
""Praying the damage will be minimal for you. It is a beautiful cottage and I know how much your Dad loved it.""
Peg Martin writes on Facebook: ""We wish we could have helped you. Ramona beach family, Peg and Tom.""
Beth Murray writes: ""The family that chops ice together stays together!""
Sandy Laveck-Burkovich says: ""Wishing for a happy ending with no damage to the house itself!""

 Finney (right) made his final screen appearance in Craig's third Bond film
James Bond star Daniel Craig has led tributes to actor Albert Finney, with whom he appeared in 2012's Skyfall.
""I'm deeply saddened by the news of Albert Finney's passing,"" he said. ""The world has lost a giant.
""Wherever Albert is now, I hope there are horses and good company.""
Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli also paid tribute, saying ""it was a privilege to work with him and an honour to have had him as part of our Bond family.""
Finney's death at the age of 82 has prompted a flood of tributes to the British star, one of the leading actors of the post-war era.
Christopher Eccleston, who hails from Finney's home city of Salford, told BBC North West Tonight: ""He was the only actor I knew of from Salford, so he was my inspiration.""
He added: ""What was interesting about him was he could deliver very, very truthful performances, but he also went on stage and played classical roles, and of course he was trained by and understudied Laurence Olivier, so he could do it all.""
Paul Greengrass, who directed Finney in 2007 thriller The Bourne Ultimatum, said he would ""miss him enormously"". 
Greengrass said: ""Albert was one of our greatest actors, significant not just for his talent but for the way he made British theatre and cinema reflect life as it was truly lived.""
He continued: ""Off screen he brought his infectious sense of humour to work every morning. He loved every aspect of the business and we in turn loved and revered him.""
US actress Bernadette Peters, who appeared alongside him in 1982's Annie, was among others to express sadness.
Comedian and novelist David Walliams remembered him simply as ""the beautiful Albert Finney"".
British film-maker Edgar Wright marked his passing by quoting one of his famous lines from Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.
Stephen Merchant, co-creator of The Office and Extras, also used Arthur Seaton's earthy dialogue to pay tribute.
Christopher McQuarrie, director of the last two Mission: Impossible films, said Finney ""was an artist with a Thompson"" - a reference to his submachine gun prowess in Miller's Crossing.
Fellow film-maker Ava DuVernay paid tribute to his versatility, saying ""that's what acting means"".
Colin Hanks, son of Oscar-winner Tom, said Finney was ""a damn fine actor"" who ""made it seem effortless, even when you knew it wasn't.""
Pulp Fiction star Rosanna Arquette and British actor David Morrissey also paid tribute.
Actor Rufus Sewell said he was ""very sad"" to hear about Finney's death, adding that he ""had the enormous privilege of working with him early on"".
""Apart from being effortlessly great he was also a great all-round example of how to behave,"" he tweeted.
Cary Elwes, star of The Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, also paid his respects.
Paul Dennett, mayor of Finney's home town Salford, said the flag at the Salford City Council office was flying at half mast as a mark of respect.
The Lowry Theatre in Salford also paid tribute by mentioning his role in its creation.
Mary Queen of Scots director Josie Rourke, a fellow Salford native, said he had been ""an inspiration"".
Others to post tributes include Bafta, the British Film Institute, the National Theatre, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the Old Vic.
BBC One will show Finney's 1994 film A Man of No Importance on Sunday at 23:30 GMT to mark his passing.

More than 200 firms contributed to our request for ideas on what the global tech trends will be in 2019. Here's a synthesis of the main themes occupying the minds of the technorati this year. You may be surprised.
This year it's all about data - a small, rather dull word for something that is profoundly changing the world we live in.
New technologies, from voice-controlled speakers to ""internet of things"" (IoT) sensors, connected cars to fitness wearables, are vastly increasing the amount of digital data we produce.
And artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and cloud computing are transforming the way we store, analyse and apply it.
""In 2019 smart sensors will start to be found everywhere, automating data collection to satisfy the voracious appetite of AI,"" says Tim Harper, a former European Space Centre engineer and now founder of G2O Water Technologies.
AI could be a powerful force for good, improving healthcare and combating climate change, for example. But it also presents many dangers - to democracy, to financial markets, to the belief in objective truth.

Data in the wrong hands, used in the wrong way, could even threaten world peace, some commentators warn.
Fake news?
""Deepfakes"" - manipulated digital videos that overlay another person's face onto a body or change what people actually said - pose a growing threat, argues Katja Bego, data scientist at innovation foundation, Nesta.
""2019 will be the year that a malicious 'deepfake' video sparks a geopolitical incident,"" she predicts. 
Media captionThe face-mapping technology raising fears about fake news
""Though deepfakes are still a relatively new technology, they are evolving incredibly fast, making it harder and harder for the naked eye - or even digital forensics tools - to identify them. At the same time, they are also becoming ever easier and cheaper to create."" 
She envisages a nightmare scenario in which a world leader could appear to declare war or spread damaging propaganda, with potentially devastating results.
As fake news stories - often state-sponsored - continue to flood social media and China's Xinhua News Agency launches its first AI-created newsreaders, the lines between the fake and the real are becoming increasingly blurred. 
If we cannot trust what we see or hear any more, is this ""the end of truth as we know it?"" asks Ms Bego.
Media captionChina's 'first AI news anchor'
Andrew Tsonchev, director of technology at cyber security company Darktrace Industrial, believes the internet's openness and lack of accountability - qualities its founders cherished - play into the hands of those with malicious intent.
""Ultimately, manipulating the public discourse might prove to be a greater cyber-risk than the hacking of our devices,"" he says. 
""Controlling data may soon become more important than stealing it.""
Under attack
Cybersecurity companies are notorious for scaring us witless in the drive to sell more of their products. But that doesn't mean their warnings are worthless.
And AI in the hands of criminal or state-sponsored hackers is certainly worth worrying about.
""2019 will see the first AI-orchestrated attack take down a FTSE 100 company,"" predicts Jason Hart, chief technology officer, data protection, at security firm Gemalto.

 Could an AI-powered cyber-attack knock out a city's entire electricity supply?
""A new breed of AI-powered malware will infect an organisation's systems, sit undetected gathering information, adapt to its surroundings, and unleash a series of bespoke attacks targeted to take down a company from the inside out.""
AI will be needed to fight AI, many believe, particularly as the IoT vastly increases the number of potential weak points in this burgeoning network of connected devices. 
Greg Day from Palo Alto Networks says: ""AI on AI cyber-battles will begin. Cybersecurity will be a machine versus machine fight with humans alongside to help and adjudicate. 
""While cybersecurity will look for new ways to spot adversaries and threats with AI, adversaries will use AI themselves and increasingly look to subvert machine learning and AI."" 
This will ramp up the stakes even further.
""We'll see the first example of a scaled-up mass IoT attack affecting critical infrastructure,"" predicts Darren Thomson, chief technology officer at cybersecurity firm Symantec.
Healthier lives
But it's not all bad news. AI unleashed on all our health data could herald a new era of personalised medicine, many believe.
""We predict that by mid-2020, two in three patients with any condition will be supported by AI and AI-related technologies, either as part of diagnostics, treatment, or administration,"" says John Gikopoulos, global head of AI and automation at Infosys Consulting.
AI-powered computers are getting better at analysing images and diagnosing cancers, and helping to identify molecules that could be turned into life-saving drugs.

 Wearable devices are giving us increasingly sophisticated data about our health and wellbeing
Virtual doctors and chatbots are giving us health advice via apps.
""In 2019, for the first time ever, there will be more health data available outside health systems than inside them,"" says Othman Laraki, chief executive of Color, a San Francisco-based genetic testing company. 
""Your Apple Watch can deduce your heart health, your mood, your sleep patterns. Your genome can tell you your risk for inherited cancer and heart disease and traits that impact everything from your caffeine sensitivity to your ability to metabolise medicine."" 
Data-driven healthcare, with an emphasis on prevention rather than cure, will have a ""tremendous societal impact"", he believes.
Taking back control?
In the wake of last year's Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in a maximum £500,000 fine for Facebook imposed by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, how big companies use and abuse our data has been under much greater scrutiny. 
As firms scramble to get their data privacy policies up to scratch now that the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation is in force, ""2019 will be the year of GDPR fines"", says Harrison Van Riper, a senior analyst at cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows.
Some commentators are predicting a consumer fightback.
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg came under fire for the cavalier way his firm treated customer data
""In 2019, I expect that consumers will start to reclaim control of their data and monetise it,"" says Phil Beckett, managing director of disputes and investigations at management consultancy Alvarez and Marsal. 
Systems are being developed to allow us to control our health, financial, social, and entertainment data effectively, argues Paul Winstanley, chief executive of Censis, a centre of excellence for sensing and imaging systems.
""It is then an individual's choice whether they want to share that data with a third party, or not.""
As consumer trust has been ""severely dented"", argues Mark Curtis, co-founder at design consultancy Fjord, firms will increasingly adopt a ""data minimalism"" approach, only asking for data they really need.
More Technology of Business
""They will have to clearly show the payback for users sharing their data, drawing a straight line from the act of sharing to receiving relevant products and services in return,"" he says.
All this consumer data, analysed by AI, will at least enable firms to personalise their services, argues Nigel Vaz, international chief executive of digital transformation agency Publicis.Sapient.
But rebuilding trust will be key, and this means consumers understanding how and why their data is being used, believes Ojas Rege, chief strategy officer at MobileIron, a mobile security company.
""Without transparency, there is no trust. Without trust, there is no data. Without data, there is no AI,"" he concludes.
The last word...
While data - how it is produced, stored, analysed and applied - is the key theme for 2019, developing technologies, such as voice control, superfast 5G mobile and connected cars, will gather pace through the year.
But these will only emphasise further how vulnerable our data is and how much harder we need to work to protect, own and value it.

Bath include winger Joe Cokanasiga after his release from England's Six Nations squad as they host Newcastle.
Hooker Tom Dunn will make his 100th appearance, while Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Joseph make up the midfield.
Newcastle also welcome back an international in flanker Gary Graham, two weeks after his Scotland debut.
Josh Matavesi (calf), Vereniki Goneva (calf) and Alex Dunbar (groin) all miss out because of injuries, but loose-head Sam Lockwood is back to full fitness.
Bath centre Jonathan Joseph told BBC Radio Bristol:
""We are in a massively confident place; not overly confident, but we are confident in our ability and we know what this next set of games means to us, and it starts with Newcastle so our focus is fully on them.
""Any team you put in front of us at the Rec, we want to put in a good performance, not just narrowly win. We want to make this place a fortress and win by four tries or what have you.
""They [Falcons] remind me of Ireland a little bit, in that they like their set-plays and two, three, four-phase attacks.

,"Image copyrightGetty Images
As 29 March approaches with no Brexit deal yet agreed on by Parliament, questions are circulating around how leaving without a deal will affect people's daily lives, including the cost of food. 
At the moment, the UK imports about 30% of its food from the EU and another 10% from the rest of the world.
If there's no deal, the question of what will happen to food crossing the border will have to be faced immediately. 
If Theresa May's plan goes through, there will be a 21-month transition period during which nothing will change while the UK and the EU try to work out a future trade agreement. 
There are lots of things that determine food prices, including the weather. But there are three main things that might affect UK food prices as a direct result of Brexit:
The taxes on imported goods, known as tariffs
Changes to the value of the pound
Things that might slow down goods crossing borders, like extra checks 
1. Tariffs
A tariff is the tax that businesses pay on goods imported from other countries. Different rates of tax apply to different products. 
But countries have to charge the same rates on the same products to each country unless they have a trade deal.
As a member of the European Union, at the moment the UK doesn't pay tariffs on goods - including food products - coming in from other EU countries. 
Let's say a supermarket wants to import beef from Ireland. 
Currently it wouldn't have to pay a tax on this but if after Brexit beef started to be taxed at 40%, which is the tariff the EU places on beef coming in from the rest of the world, that's a 40% extra cost to the importer.
The UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex calculated that an average tariff of 44.6% on dairy could translate to a price rise of 8.1%.
Meat could rise in price by 5.8%, oils and fats by 7.8% and vegetables by 4% on average.
Businesses want to charge their customers competitive prices, so they may well absorb some of the costs themselves. 
But past a certain point, they may well have to pass on that extra cost to make a profit - and that could translate to more expensive food in the shops. 
The UK could choose to lower tariffs - or scrap them altogether - and that could, in theory, lead to lower prices for consumers.
The University of Sussex researchers also assessed the impact of zero tariffs on food imports and said this may only reduce food prices by an average of 1%.
That's because the goods which are currently subject to the highest rates of tariffs are food items mainly produced in the UK or imported from Europe without any tariffs, like meat and dairy. 
And products like tea which the UK mostly imports from outside the EU already attract low tariffs - for tea it's 0.86% - so getting rid of those wouldn't contribute as much to falls in food prices. 
Businesses could choose to import more products like meat and dairy from outside the EU if that became more competitive. 
The idea of lowering tariffs on imported goods which the UK also produces has worried farmers, who fear a flood of cheap imported food putting them out of business.
In response, the government has said it will not impose zero-rate tariffs on food imports. 
It will have to balance the interests of consumers, who want to see their food prices kept low, with those of farmers and growers, when setting the tariff rates.

Faced with more expensive imported beef for example, shoppers could decide to buy British. But they might not have that choice when it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables. 
In March, when a lot of UK produce is out of season, it imports 90% of its lettuce, 80% of its tomatoes and 70% of its soft fruit from the European Union, according to the British Retail Consortium, which represents shopkeepers. 
A no-deal document published by the government said: ""At the time of year we will be leaving the EU, the UK is particularly reliant on the short channel crossings for fresh fruit and vegetables. 
""In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario.""
But it added that less than 1 in 10 food items is expected to be affected.
2. Exchange rates
When the value of the pound decreases compared with other currencies, it becomes more expensive to buy things from abroad - a pound that's worth less buys less stuff. 
That will ""directly affect the cost of getting imported food products onto supermarket shelves,"" the Institute for Financial Studies says. 
It gave the comparison of what happened in 2007-08 around the time of the global financial crisis. Sterling depreciated in value by 21% and food prices rose by 8.7% relative to other goods.
There were other things going on at the time though, apart from currency exchange rates - there were sharp rises in world prices for things like petroleum and fertiliser.
But other countries which did not experience currency depreciations did not experience food price rises as ""large nor as persistent"" as in the UK, the IFS says, suggesting ""exchange rates played an important role in driving higher food prices in the UK"". 
The pound has fallen in value since the referendum and that is thought to have contributed to a small rise in food prices, according to a study by the London School of Economics.

3. Non-tariff barriers
Another thing which could affect the prices of food for retailers is the cost of having to do extra checks at ports - what's known as ""non-tariff barriers"". 
The House of Lords' European Union committee in a report on food prices after Brexit said: ""As well as causing delays and shortening the shelf-life of products, non-tariff barriers are an additional cost for businesses"". 
It quoted a report by consultancy firm KPMG which calculated that ""one day of delay for a lorry will easily cost a business 600 to 1,000 euros"" (£500-£850).
The government has set out steps which businesses should take to minimise disruption at borders.
In its recent no-deal document it said it was putting procedures in place to make it easier for traders importing from the EU to comply with customs requirements immediately after Brexit, to ease the effects of those non-tariff barriers. 
It is set to publish a schedule of the tariffs it plans to impose on goods imported from the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit shortly.

 Cyclone survivors from a flattened township head to Chimanimani Hotel with their belongings
A hotel in Zimbabwe's south-eastern town of Chimanimani is providing shelter for those who have lost their homes in Cyclone Idai, which has devastated huge swathes of southern Africa.
Mandla Mataure, the general manager of Chimanimani Hotel, told BBC Focus on Africa radio what he and his team were doing to help:
From the first night we have been sheltering about 400 people. It's families - men, women, children who were just stranded and had nowhere to go after their homes were destroyed.
So we've opened up our doors: we've got a big enough conference room and lounge for people to sleep - camping style, at least until we can get something more semi-permanent.
We're cooking pretty much on open fires - last night [Monday] we fed 390 people.
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 People are still searching for those that are missing in Chimanimani
A lot of people feel safer here [at night], maybe going back during the day to the areas where their homes were to try and salvage whatever they can find.
There's still a fear of landslides -the rocks or trees that were loosened during the rains.
'It took no prisoners'
When the rains came on Friday night, it was like nothing I've ever heard experienced before. 
It was loud. It took no prisoners - this cyclone came and hit us very hard.
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Many roads and around Chimanimani have been destroyed
We were fortunate because this building was built soon after World War Two, so it's got very solid concrete walls - it wasn't damaged but just standing near a window and hearing the sheer force of the wind and the rain, I couldn't even imagine what it was like for those who were in the village.
Buildings were swept away, we're in a mountainous area - it's a mess. A lot of lives have been lost and we're still counting, some people have been buried but some bodies are still under rubble.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 A bridge was washed away along the Umvumvu River in Chimanimani...
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 People have had to find alternative ways to cross
A lot of roads are damaged. 
We've got about four or five different roads that can bring you to Chimanimani but on each road there's at least one or two bridges that have been damaged, making those roads impassable, so we're pretty much stranded at the moment.
More on Cyclone Idai:
The water is starting to recede, leaving newly created tributaries that we're having to deal with. It is still raining on and off.
There are probably other areas in more need of rescue and support than us. Where we are is more the ""Central Business District"" (CBD) of Chimanimani, but the more remote areas are in desperate need of support.
'Time is of the essence'
We've worked a system where we've had a few well-wishers donating a few things to us from the village with the shops that are open.
As far as food is concerned, for the next four to five days we can try and cook and feed people with what we have in the village, but eventually that's going to run out.
But we need doctors, we need people airlifted out of here, we need blankets to keep people warm. 
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Some of those killed have already been buried
People have survived a flood and a landslide - we can't have them now dying from pneumonia or common cold or cholera.
We're trying to keep the place as clean as possible.
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 It is going to take many months to clear up the devastation left by Cyclone Idai in Chimanimani
We've tried our best to divert water to come through here because some of the council's tanks were destroyed, so we're trying to have a steady flow of clean water for people, but it's not a sustainable solution.
My appeal is that people get here as soon as possible. The sky clears up once or twice every day so if they could fly support in here.
Time is of the essence, some bodies have still not been found - we need search teams, people to help us bury people - there's a lot that's needs to be done. 
This is not a one- or two-day crisis; it is going to take us some time to resolve, so the sooner we can get support the better.",A hotel in Zimbabwe is sheltering hundreds of people who have lost their homes in Cyclone Idai.,,2019-03-20,BBC News,Cyclone Idai: The hotel manager providing a safe haven in Zimbabwe,

,"Media captionAfrican Americans in New Orleans reflect on race relations
February was Black History Month in the US, a time typically set aside to recognise African Americans and their contributions to the country. 
This year's commemoration ended with insults and accusations of racism on the floor of Congress, at a televised hearing broadcast into millions of homes. But that exchange, between a Democrat and Republican, was hardly an isolated incident.
The month began with calls for Virginia's governor to resign after a photo emerged of him in blackface. And it ended with President Donald Trump - who himself has been accused of racism - saying Academy Award winner Spike Lee was being racist after the film director urged Americans to ""do the right thing"" and choose love over hate by helping to thwart Mr Trump's re-election hopes.
The flood of racially-charged headlines underlined a feeling shared by many - that 400 years after the first slaves were brought to the US, Americans still struggle to have meaningful conversations about race. 
""We can't even have a productive conversation if people aren't open to looking in the mirror,"" said Ibram Kendi, director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. 
""Denial is essentially the heartbeat of racism in this country and every time you are not open to what you could be doing in the moment, you are living and breathing racism itself."" 
He says the first step to dismantling racism in the US is recognising that we can all shift between being racist and anti-racist. 
""When someone is charged with doing something that's racist, instead of getting upset and lashing out, they should consider the evidence."" 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Spike Lee never mentioned President Trump by name in his speech but it was interpreted as a message to vote him out
Conversations about race typically devolve into arguments because Americans have come to view the word ""racist"" a permanent label and not a description of an action, says Mr Kendi. 
He now advocates for redefining the word ""racist"" as a reflection of both our beliefs and behaviours and not merely as an insult. 
""A racist supports, by their action or inaction, policies that reproduce racial inequality. An anti-racist supports, with their actions, policies that reduce or eliminate racial inequality,"" says Mr Kendi. 
""What you're doing and what you're saying is an expression of who you are in that moment.""
Much of this discussion was sparked by the argument on the floor of the House of Representatives, which began when after Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic freshman, accused the Republican veteran congressman Mark Meadows of racism and using a black woman as a ""prop"". 
Mr Meadows had asked Lynne Patton, a long-time employee of the Trump Organization, to attend the Michael Cohen hearing to refute accusations that President Trump was racist. 
Speaking for Ms Patton, Mr Meadows said ""as the daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, there is no way she would work for a man who is racist"". 
When Ms Tlaib said that simply having a friend or employee who's a minority does not prohibit someone from being racist, the hearing quickly dissolved into a very heated row.
Social psychologist Daniel Effron, who studies morality and race, said there's a reason people often resort to the ""black friend"" defence when charged with racism.
Mr Effron said his research shows that whenever a person is accused of racism or their moral identity is challenged, they instinctively search for any example to bolster their ""non-racist credentials"", which can be a low bar. 
""When people are motivated to find evidence that they're not prejudiced, they're more likely to think having a black friend is really strong evidence,"" he said. 
""We make a mountain of morality out of a molehill of virtue."" 
But even people with good intentions can face criticism when it comes to discussing race in America, as the director of the Oscar-winning movie Green Book discovered.
Set against the backdrop of the segregated South in the 1960s, the film follows the unlikely friendship between a black classical and jazz musician and his white chauffeur. 
Critics accused the film of whitewashing history and furthering the ""white saviour"" trope in Hollywood. 
Media captionRacism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality?
Author and anti-racism activist Tim Wise said he thinks we need to reframe the way we teach race in America, shifting the emphasis away from an individual's actions and looking at the system as a whole. 
""When we think about the way Americans teach racism historically, it is a story about individuals who did or did not own slaves, individuals who did or did not own segregated businesses. It's a lot harder to see systems of inequality,"" he said, adding that this can absolve people from reflecting on their own actions. 
Mr Wise explores his own struggles with reconciling white privilege and racism in his autobiography White Like Me and has made a career out of navigating difficult conversations about racism. 
He said he thinks Americans have been conditioned to believe certain racial stereotypes and unlearning those prejudices begins with recognising they exist in the first place. Until then, he said, we will continue to have circular arguments about race without making progress toward dismantling racism. 
""It would be ridiculous to say, 'I don't have a racist bone in my body'... you grew up in America,"" he says. 
""It's about saying, 'Look, I'm going to be humble enough to admit my weaknesses. Not because I want you to beat me up and not because I want to beat myself up, but because I know that I'm capable of better.'""",A series of very public arguments over race blighted Black History Month and reminded us of an undisputed fact.,,2019-03-05,BBC News,Should the term 'racist' be redefined?,

Judge Lord Burns said: ""This drug was being produced on an industrial scale. You must have one of the major sources of what was described as a flood of this drug into Scotland.

Dean Richards' side won their first two pool games, adding a dramatic home victory over Montpellier to an opening-round success away to Toulon, but have lost their other three.
However, defence coach John Wells insists that this weekend's match is crucial as Newcastle attempt to prise themselves off the bottom of the Premiership. The Falcons are four points adrift of Worcester, who they play on 3 March.
""We just need to muscle up and do better,"" he said.
""People on the outside might view this as a dead rubber, but for us it's incredibly important in helping generate the momentum which is going to take us through the back half of the Premiership season.
""It's a chance to do a home-and-away double against a side who have won the Champions Cup three times in the past six years.""
Toulon have named a formidable line-up with former All Black Julian Savea paired with Fiji's Josua Tuisova in the centres.
While Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb is on the bench, ex New Zealand international Liam Messam and Georgian legend Mamuka Gorgodze are part of the pack.
""They've got stars left, right and centre,"" added Wells. 
""In many ways that makes it all the more pleasurable from our side, because we'll have beaten their full-bore side twice in the same season if we do produce the victory we're working so hard towards.""

Gallagher Premiership
Venue: Kingston Park Date: Sunday, 3 March Kick-off: 15:00 GMT
Coverage: Live score updates on BBC local radio and on the BBC Sport website
Scotland back-row forward Gary Graham returns for Newcastle after winning his second cap against France in Paris.
Samoan international Logovi'i Mulipola returns at tight-head prop, while Zach Kibirige keeps his place on the wing after his two tries at leaders Exeter.
Worcester's Chris Pennell equals the club's Premiership appearance record, matching Craig Gillies' total of 149.
In an unchanged Warriors team, Wales' Josh Adams is rested following his performance against England in Cardiff. 
Prior to his late match-clinching try - his second in successive Six Nations matches - Adams suffered groin and head injuries, and is held back for Wales' trip to Murrayfield to face Scotland next Saturday (9 March).
Bottom club Newcastle, who were 23-20 winners when the two sides met at Sixways in September, remain hampered by an injury list that deprives them of Vereniki Goneva, Alex Tait, Joel Hodgson, Alex Dunbar, Michael Young, Jon Welsh, Glen Young, Rodney Ah You, Tom Penny and Sean Robinson.
Worcester remain without hooker Joe Taufete'e, on international duty for the USA against Uruguay in Seattle, while GJ van Velze has undergone surgery on a fractured forearm, so centre Ryan Mills will again captain the side.
Where they stand
Worcester lie 10th in the Premiership table, nine points clear of bottom club Newcastle. But the Warriors have lost their past five away Premiership games since winning at Leicester in September.
Newcastle have won only one Premiership home game this season - and have lost their past five league matches on the trot, picking up just two losing bonus points in the process.
Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards:
""Worcester are a side that we need to beat because of where we are in the league in relation to each other and, if we do, then it opens it all up again. 
""If we lose it becomes more difficult but there are seven games left after this weekend, and Worcester and Bristol still have to play each other.
""We have to start winning and keep the momentum going. The guys fronted up physically last weekend. We're lacking nothing on that side of things. 
""We scored three tries against a good Exeter side and should have had a couple more. We had the opportunities but left them out there and Exeter are top of the league for a reason.""
Worcester director of rugby Alan Solomons:
""GJ is a massive loss as he is a terrific player and captain. But fortunately we have got Ryan Mills, who lives and breathes the club and he will step into his shoes as skipper.
""We have also got Marco Mama who can lead the pack so, fortunately, we do have replacements.
""Of course we will miss GJ but the loose trio we had last weekend all did really well against Leicester. Ted Hill, Marco and Sammy Lewis made a good fist of it.""

,"Mathew Tait's last try came against Saracens on Christmas Eve 2017
Former England centre Mathew Tait has retired from rugby union after failing to recover from an Achilles injury.
The 33-year-old, who spent the last eight years with Leicester Tigers, was the last member of England's starting XV from the 2007 World Cup final defeat by South Africa still playing.
He began his career with Newcastle in 2004 before moving to Sale in 2008 and onto Welford Road three years later.
Tait's final game was against former club Sale at the end of last season.
""It isn't how I planned to finish up, this ongoing problem with my Achilles has caught up with me and, on the advice of people much more in the know than me, it's the right time to call it quits,"" Tait told the Leicester website.
Tait was just 21 years old when he played in the 2007 World Cup final
Tait won 36 England caps between 2005 and 2010 and played 280 club matches, also winning the 2012 Premiership title and the 2017 Anglo-Welsh Cup with Leicester.
He is the third-youngest player to score a try in the Premiership, having crossed with his first touch of the ball on his debut for Newcastle against London Irish in May 2004.
""I've been so fortunate to achieve many things in the game and it's hard to pinpoint one highlight, let alone a few, but obviously being able to win the Premiership with Tigers stands out, as well representing my country and, of course, playing in a World Cup Final,"" he said.
""I also think being able to have played against and alongside my brother Alex is something I'll always remember as being very special.
""I owe a lot to a lot of people who have made it possible for me to live out my dream and I thank every one of those people who have played a role from my school days, through Newcastle and Sale, England and, of course, here at Tigers.""
Tait 'among the leading players of his generation'
The 2007 World Cup final was the final Rugby World Cup game Mathew Tait would play for England
Following Tait's retirement, Toby Flood is the only player from England's second World Cup final appearance still active, the Newcastle fly-half came on as a replacement for Mike Catt early in the second half of the 15-6 loss to South Africa.
Tait made his England debut against Wales in the 2005 Six Nations and scored his first try against the same opposition in a World Cup warm-up game two years later.
His last England cap came as a replacement against Australia in Perth in June 2010.
""Matt has been among the leading players of his generation since making his breakthrough as a teenager at Newcastle,"" Leicester head coach Geordan Murphy said.
""In the past few seasons we have been able to use him at centre and full-back, and it says a lot for his knowledge and his quality as a player that he has been able to absorb the detail of different roles and has always been willing to play wherever he has been needed in the team.

,"Media captionFive questions about Trump's border wall
Politicians in Washington have had a lot to say about the merits or otherwise of a border wall thousands of miles away. But what do the lawmakers based there say?
There are nine members of the House of Representatives whose districts lie along the US-Mexico border.
It is perhaps not surprising that the eight Democrats oppose President Donald Trump's signature campaign pledge.
But the one Republican congressman - whose district stretches for 820 miles (1,320km) along the border - is also hostile. Most of his party back the president.
These nine border politicians have intimate knowledge of the border and the issues arising from the movement of people - legal or otherwise - across it.
So what have they said?
Will Hurd, Texas Republican
""I think building a concrete structure sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security,"" said Will Hurd, a Republican congressman whose district has the longest border with Mexico.
Congressman Hurd's 23rd Congressional District, which stretches from El Paso to Antonio, shares the largest border with Mexico of any member of Congress.
Mr Hurd, a former CIA agent who happens to be the only black Republican in the House of Representatives, has argued for a ""smart border wall"" which would be composed of sensors and other technology.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Will Hurd meets with constituents at the Fiesta San Antonio in 2017
""A Smart Wall would use sensor, radar and surveillance technologies to detect and track incursions across our border so we can deploy efficiently our most important resource, the men and women of Border Patrol, to perform the most difficult task - interdiction,"" he wrote in an op-ed in 2017.
Mr Hurd, who broke rank with Republicans to vote on a Democratic-led bill to reopen government, said after Mr Trump's speech on Tuesday: ""If this is a crisis, the people that are dealing with this crisis should get paid.""
Federal workers who are deemed ""essential"" such as border patrol agents, have been forced to work without pay as the shutdown continues.
Vicente Gonzalez, Texas Democrat
""It's a 4th Century solution to a 21st Century problem,"" said Congressman Vicente Gonzalez, whose district includes the border town of McAllen, which Trump plans to visit during the funding impasse.
""Nobody wants stronger border control than me,"" he told CBS. 
But he opposes adding to the existing border wall because he does not ""think it brings real border security and it comes at a major cost to taxpayers"".
Henry Cuellar, Texas Democrat
Congressman Henry Cuellar, who represents Texas' 8th congressional district, believes $4bn is needed to modernise ports of entry, not for a wall which he says would only delay migrants by ""a few minutes or a few seconds"".
He adds that modern telecommunications for border agents, and funding to help Mexico secure it's own southern border, would also be helpful.
Ann Kirkpatrick, Arizona Democrat
The new Arizona congresswoman took office in early January as the representative for Arizona's 2nd District and has pledged not to vote for border funding.
""We don't want a wall in southern Arizona. A third of our economy comes from Mexico. We want to build bridges not walls,"" she told Arizona Public Media as she was sworn in.
Raúl Grijalva, Arizona Democrat
Mr Grijalva has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump's proposal.
""Not a single cent should go to funding Trump's monument to hate,"" he tweeted after Mr Trump addressed the nation on primetime TV to argue that there is a ""crisis"" at the border.
""This is a terrible, terrible mistake that Trump is making,"" he told CBS, calling it ""a fantasy"" and ""not a solution"".
""It would be devastating to my district,"" said Mr Grijalva, whose own father came emigrated from Mexico in the 1940s.

Veronica Escobar, Texas Democrat
In her first act as a newly elected member of Congress, Veronica Escobar of Texas' 16th District chose to cast her vote for ""Nancy 'no wall' Pelosi"" - the Democratic House leader who has opposed budgeting for Mr Trump's wall.
""Donald Trump is trying to portray border communities as these open, lawless areas where a wall will solve problems,"" she said in a Twitter video for MoveOn.org, a Democratic advocacy group. 
Mrs Escobar, who represents the border city of El Paso, blamed Republicans for wrongly and ""needless fear mongering about communities like mine"".

 Walls and fences already cover many miles of the US border
Juan Vargas, California Democrat
Congressman Juan Vargas, who has represented California's 51st District for the last five years, said there is no crisis where he lives along the border. 
""I live along the border, about a little over 10 miles from the border. It's San Diego. I mean, it's basically paradise,"" he told CNN. ""The notion that we have a crisis there, security crisis, is absolute nonsense.""
""The reality is, yes, there are people sneaking into our country,"" Mr Vargas said. ""We can stop that if we have smart solutions, and that's only going to be reliant on technology.""

New Mexico's newly elected Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small visited the border earlier this week with other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Filemon Vela Jr, Texas Democrat
Texas Congressman Filemon Vela Jr has said in the past that he agrees with President Trump on trying to tackle the Mexican drug cartels and deporting criminals.
But he is deeply opposed to the wall.
In a scathing open letter to candidate Trump in 2016, he said: ""Why any modern-thinking person would ever believe that building a wall along the border of a neighbouring country, which is both our ally and one of our largest trading partners, is frankly astounding and asinine.""

 The floodwaters have spread more than 60km (37 miles) offshore
Dirty water from a flood crisis in northern Australia has spread to parts of the Great Barrier Reef, placing it under stress, scientists say.
The floods are the result of weeks of devastating rain in Queensland.
Aerial pictures show that run-off from one river has blanketed some reef areas more than 60km (37 miles) from shore.
Scientists fear the sediment-laden waters may be blocking out light and effectively ""smothering"" coral. Tests are yet to be undertaken.
The Great Barrier Reef, located in the Coral Sea off the coast of Queensland, is a diverse World Heritage site that spans an area of 344,400 sq km (133,000 sq mi).
In recent weeks, run-off from several rivers has coalesced to affect an approximately 600km stretch of the reef's outer edges, scientists say.
The water has not dispersed due to its size and a recent lack of wind.
Image copyrightMATT CURNOCK/TROPWATER JCUImage caption
 The run-off can contain pesticides which disrupt the balance of the coral reef ecosystem
""Generally a bit of wind and wave action can break the plumes up quite quickly, but we have literally had no wind so they're just sitting there hanging,"" said Dr Frederieke Kroon from the Australian Institute of Marine Science.
She told the BBC that the nutrient-rich water had also sparked algae growth in some areas, turning waters ""a thick blanket of green"".
""The biggest concern at the moment is this reduced light - if it persists for much longer, in some cases we can actually see a smothering of the system,"" said Jane Waterhouse, a scientist from James Cook University's TropWATER research unit.
However, she said strong winds - if they eventuated - could mitigate the impact.
The reef is already facing threats to its survival such as coral bleaching caused by warmer sea temperatures. Mass bleaching events occurred in 2016 and 2017.
Media captionWarmer water has led to mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef

,"Jonny May playing for England in the 2018 Six Nations (left) and, nine years earlier, for Hartpury Some of the opposition attempted to level the playing field. ""One club would flood the changing rooms so we would have to get changed in the car park,"" remembers Hartpury's Sean Lynn. ""At others, the lights wouldn't work in the changing rooms, or we would be given a tiny broom cupboard with the heaters on full blast to make it like a sauna. ""It got really competitive."" Hartpury College RFC's inaugural match in 2004 was a defeat. Smith's Industries II, a social side known amongst themselves as the Hamsters, proved too strong in a 16-10 loss. But Hartpury did not lose again for another five years. In 2017, less than 13 years after that very first match against Smiths, they secured their ninth promotion, winning all 30 of their National League One matches to complete a rise from Gloucester Three North - one of the lowest rungs on the league pyramid - to the Championship, just one tier off the top of the English game. Hartpury's route to the Championship Division Tier of English rugby First season in division Championship Two 2017-18 National League One Three 2014-15 National League 2 South Four 2011-12 National League 3 South Five 2010-11 South West One West League Six 2009-10 Western Counties North League Seven 2008-09 Gloucester Premier League Eight 2007-08 Gloucester One Nine 2006-07 Gloucester Two 10 2005-06 Gloucester Three North 11 2004-05 Hartpury are very different to the teams they were rubbing shoulders with in their early days. It was set up to give the college's players, often talented prospects on specialist sports courses, another, very different sort of rugby from their usual student opposition. Lynn was at Hartpury in those early days and remembers the culture clash as young bucks came up against grizzled warhorses on the club circuit. ""Whichever place we went to it was the same - 'let's show these students what proper rugby is all about',"" he remembers. ""There were a few cheap shots here and there and it taught our boys how to play local rugby very fast. ""They would start as freshers and leave as men."" Some were heading a lot higher. It has not taken long for Hartpury to develop a stellar line-up of old boys. Ross Moriarty and Dan Norton went on to represent Wales and the British and Irish Lions, and England sevens respectively England's break-neck speedster Jonny May, Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert, sevens legend Dan Norton, Ulster fly-half Billy Burns and Gloucester's hot scrum-half prospect Ben Vellacott are among the unwelcome backline sights to have greeted Hartpury's opponents in past years. In the forwards, any attempt to rough up future Lion Ross Moriarty, Leicester's 'baby rhino' Ellis Genge or Italy back rows-to-be Jake Polledri and Sebastian Negri would not have ended well. There are plenty of other names. Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson, Exeter second row Jonny Hill, Gloucester full-back Jason Woodward and Bath lock Elliott Stooke - all Hartpury old boys - have all been called up to training camps by England coach Eddie Jones. Some don't wait until leaving Hartpury to get their taste of international action. Back in 2008, Matt Evans played for Canada against Wales one weekend at the Millennium Stadium before turning out away at Stroud on the next. Gloucester centre Henry Trinder, who returned to the England set-up this summer, is another. Trinder was in the same Hartpury team as fellow Gloucester back, former England wing Charlie Sharples He believes that the exposure to frontline, physical rugby helps Hartpury students bypass the bottleneck that can develop at Premiership clubs. ""Playing Wednesday and then Saturday you got a lot of rugby,"" he told BBC Sport of his time at Hartpury. ""It was in the lower leagues and people wanted to beat us up rather than play against us. We were winning quite convincingly, but I think they wanted to take a shot at these teenagers running rings around them. ""In academy set-ups that I was involved with you had six games maximum. If you were not being loaned out or playing university rugby, that is a lot of training. ""Training is great, mixing with the first-teamers, but you don't learn those deep lessons that you get through regular game time and pressure situations."" Now-Leicester and England prop Ellis Genge makes headway for Hartpury against Richmond Although the make up of the team has shifted slightly over the years, its core purpose remains. It is an open club, but 28 of the 40 players reporting for pre-season training this season were current students at the college. ""We have had some experienced players, who have brought on the younger players, but it will remain a mainly student-based side because otherwise what we have done will have been pointless,"" said current director of rugby John Barnes. After their meteoric rise, Hartpury have hit a ceiling. They are currently 11th in a 12-team Championship populated mostly by fully professional teams. But that is just fine with Barnes. ""We would never want to go up to the Premiership,"" he adds. ""That would be a huge step too far financially, we are out of our league already in those terms in the Championship. ""We are still part-time, the guys will go off to lectures and a few will go off to work. ""Our main aim is to be successful like anyone but keep producing talent, that is what will drive Hartpury forward.

,"Wisemantel, right, played rugby league for Paramatta Eels and was part of Australia's coaching team at the 2007 World Cup
Six Nations: England v Italy
Venue: Twickenham, London Date: Saturday, 9 March Kick-off: 16:45 GMT
Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app, plus live text commentary online.
How much freedom will England's backroom staff, sat in the Twickenham gods, allow their players? 
How do they make sure their instructions are useful stage directions rather than tactical straitjackets? 
It is a balance Scott Wisemantel is constantly seeking to find.
""You have to be quite fluid and have basic principles rather than hard and fast rules,"" the England attack coach told BBC Sport.
""We definitely want to be quite precise in the first two phases and then have some basic shapes they can move into.""
If it sounds like interpretative dance in theory, it is backed by improvisation sessions in practice.
England training now includes time for players to riff on high-risk rugby. 
The notoriously demanding Eddie Jones turns a blind eye as his squad have carte blanche from Wisemantel to attempt game-breaking moments.
""We are actually getting the players to express themselves. Within training, there is a segment where it is OK to make mistakes to try and become better at a certain skill,"" Wisemantel adds.
""The reason I go down that route is if you practise conservatively all the time and a game is in the balance and you need to do something extraordinary, if you haven't trained up that skill it is very difficult to skill it up.
""If you have trained that up though, it is easy to dumb it down if you just have to close a game out.""
Wisemantel was brought into the England set-up last May to jump-start Jones' stalling side.
They ran in five tries against the Springboks in the first match following his appointment and in the autumn scored more tries than New Zealand and Australia in their Twickenham meetings.

Six Nations: England beat Grand Slam champions Ireland 32-20
So far in this year's Six Nations they have scored 11 tries, only three short of last year's total for the whole campaign, with matches against Scotland and Italy still to come.
Wisemantel emphasises that, like the players, the coaches are a team. 
He worked alongside Steve Borthwick, the line-out coach, to create the ambitious long throw that ultimately led to Jonny May's try early in their win over Ireland for instance.
As well as leaning on his current colleagues, the Australian draws on his experiences of playing rugby league and coaching at various clubs and countries in both hemispheres.
And, like Jones, he also looks to other sports for inspiration.
""I watch a lot of football, field hockey, Aussie Rules - games where you have to move the ball up the field and there is space to manipulate,"" he adds.
England coach Eddie Jones visited West Ham in April 2018 and has also consulted netball, hockey, cricket coaches in pursuit of an attacking edge
Canny pre-planned moves have provided the key moment in several high-profile games recently. 
Fewer than three months before that long line-out set the tone for England's win in Dublin, the Irish beat the All Blacks via a clever first-phase switch to release Jacob Stockdale down the blindside for the game's only try.
With defences bigger, faster and more disciplined than ever, could Wisemantel foresee a day when rugby apes American Football with enormous playbooks detailing an arsenal of pre-planned moves?
""We do have set-plays in place to try and break down defences but it is never going to get as extensive as the NFL because there it requires so much information,"" he said.
""The forwards have to learn the line-out, then a playbook. If that playbook is like 'War and Peace', they are never going to remember it.
""The game is fluid. The players don't get the break like they do in NFL, it is continuous, that is its beauty.""
The last time this weekend's visitors Italy were at Twickenham, they exploited a loophole in the game's ruck laws to flood 'offside', confusing the home crowd and players while putting a significant spanner in the chariot's spokes.
""It was credit to Conor O'Shea as a coach,"" said Wisemantel.
""He is quite creative. It is good and exciting for us because it is something different.""

NHS Scotland said it had contingency plans in place to dispose of clinical waste - it has asked HES to clarify its position. The Scottish government said its contingency plans would ensure it was done safely. Garry Pettigrew, the managing director of HES, told the BBC that his company had been having financial difficulties. He said: ""Our banking facilities have went through the process of obviously being run predominantly from London. ""We had a very supportive bank, we still have a bank.

 The aircraft carriers were constructed across seven sites before being assembled at Rosyth
Another 150 jobs are to be lost at the Babcock shipyard in Rosyth, the company has confirmed.
The yard is currently working on the second of two aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy.
In November 2017, the yard announced 250 redundancies, followed by a further loss of 150 jobs in March last year.
A Babcock spokesman said it ""anticipated the loss of about 150 specific roles"".
He said it followed an assessment of the company's current workload and medium-term opportunities and said the roles were no longer needed in line with the rundown of the aircraft carrier programme. 
'Kick in the teeth'
The Unite union said the news was a ""kick in the teeth"" for the Scottish economy and a ""world-class workforce that had worked tirelessly to build the UK's two new aircraft carriers"".
Steve Turner, the union's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said: ""The men and women whose skills built the UK's two new world-leading aircraft carriers at Rosyth are at risk of being lost for a generation in a blow to the Scottish economy and UK shipbuilding.
""Today's announcement of job losses will send shudders down the spine of shipyard workers across the UK who in recent months have endured the threat of redundancy on the Mersey and the closure of Devon's Appledore shipyard.""

He also called for the government to bring forward work on the Type 31e frigate for export around the globe.

A spokesman for Babcock said the prospects for Babcock's operations at Rosyth ""remain strong with great opportunities"". 
""Last year we began the process to reshape our business in order to remain competitive and take on new challenges, as the large-scale design and build phase of the Queen Elizabeth carrier programme reaches completion,"" he said.

 The designer behind the proposed course said it would create much-needed local jobs
An inquiry into the long-running application to build a golf development on specially-protected sand dunes in Sutherland is set to begin. 
An American businessman wants to construct the controversial course on the Coul Links site near Dornoch. 
Todd Warnock believes it will create much-needed local jobs and it has the backing of some local residents.
But environmental groups insist it will devastate one of Scotland's most important protected habitats. 
The sand dunes border Loch Fleet, the most northerly inlet on the east coast. 
As a whole, the site provides habitat for wintering birds and rare plants. 
Image copyrightAndrew WestonImage caption
 The area provides habitat for wintering birds and rare plants
It holds three protected designations including that of a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
Jonathan Hughes, the chief executive of the Scottish Wildlife Trust who used to work as a warden at the site, described it as ""the most wonderful wild stretch of coastland"".
While wandering through the dunes, he told BBC Scotland: ""It's just about got the highest level of protection you can have for a nature site in the UK.
""We have these wonderful winter loch systems which flood in the winter and are fantastic areas for wintering wild fowl. 
""Then in the summer, they dry out and burst into life as these wonderful wet wild flower meadows.""
'Seriously significant damage'
He added: ""It's one of the most important coastal areas that I've ever seen in Scotland and it has an amazing diversity of wildlife.
""In terms of the damage that the golf course would cause, we're talking seriously significant damage. It would never recover.""
One of the major concerns is that fertilisers, required to build and maintain the golf course, would seep into the wetlands.
Conservationists believe that would fundamentally change the composition of the land.
But resident Yvonne Ross insists the golf course would bring much-needed land management to the site.
She said: ""It is a beautiful area but I think a golf course will only serve to enhance that area. 
""I think the management of it will save it becoming even more barren. 
""The development is going to bring some jobs with it but it's the knock-on effect that our community has been looking at and I think the Coul Links effect has already started in Dornoch with the types of businesses that want to come here.""

 There are fears that fertilisers would seep into the wetlands
Ms Ross said she hoped ministers would approve the planning application at the end of the inquiry and feared for the consequences of it being thrown out.
She added: ""I think it [would] have a serious impact on the community and probably on the Highlands as a whole, saying we're not open to investments and we're not open to new way of managing our land.""
Oystercatchers, red shanks and curlews are regular visitors to the site because of its intertidal sand flats.
Nationally, species of eelgrass provide an important food source for waterfowl and a shelter for juvenile fish.
Permission for the development was granted in June 2018 by Highland councillors.
'Comprehensive and fair process'
But the planning application was called in by Scottish ministers following increasing pressure from the environmental community.
The World Commission on Protected Areas wrote to the Scottish government saying the decision was of ""significant concern"".
Mr Warnock said the democratic process had been ""comprehensive and fair"" and urged ministers not to call it in.

 Low-lying suburbs in Townsville have been inundated
Two men have died in floodwaters that have forced large-scale evacuations in the Australian city of Townsville.
The pair's bodies were found near a park on Tuesday, following what has been described as a ""once in a century"" flood in the northern Queensland city.
Police did not confirm whether the victims were two men, aged 21 and 23, whose disappearances on Monday had led to the discovery of the bodies.
Thousands of houses may have been flooded, officials said on Tuesday.
Townsville has received more than a metre (3.3ft) of rain in the past 10 days - the equivalent of the region's total annual rainfall.
Police did not give further details about the two deaths, other than to say their relatives had been notified. 
At least 19 people found trapped in floodwaters have been rescued since Sunday, according to state officials.
Media captionThe council released a dam which had swollen to double its capacity
In one instance, two police officers were pulled to safety after being forced to cling to trees when floods swept away their vehicle.
Volunteer rescuers and the army have used small boats, tanks and trucks to evacuate residents in low-lying areas. More than 1,100 people have been moved to higher ground.
On Sunday, authorities were forced to open the gates of the city's main dam after it swelled to double its capacity - releasing up to 1,900 cubic metres of water a second.
Floodwaters had begun to recede in some areas on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison toured the city and praised the efforts of local officials.
""I know that we had two deaths confirmed this afternoon but the scale of the evacuations that took place, it was an extraordinary achievement,"" Mr Morrison told radio 2GB.
However, local officials warned that forecasts of more heavy rain could pose fresh dangers in coming days.
Mr Morrison said Townsville would receive airlifts of food, water and other supplies, and that residents could apply for relief payments of up to A$1,000 (£550; $725).
""It is a big clean-up. It will be a big job, but the community is really strong,"" he told reporters.
People have also been warned after crocodiles, snakes and other wildlife were reportedly spotted in flooded suburban streets.
Northern Queensland has a tropical climate and experiences monsoon rain from December to April. 
But the recent downpour has been described as ""unprecedented"" by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

 The Great Barrier Reef in 2015
Australia plans to dump one million tonnes of sludge in the Great Barrier Reef.
Despite strict laws on dumping waste, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) gave the go-ahead.
A loophole was found - the laws don't apply to materials generated from port maintenance work.
It comes one week after flood water from Queensland spread into the reef, which scientists say will ""smother"" the coral. 
Image copyrightWILLIAM WEST/Getty Images
The industrial residue is dredged from the bottom of the sea floor near Hay Point Port - one of the world's largest coal exports and a substantial economic source for the country. 
Larissa Waters, senator for Queensland and co-deputy leader of the Greens Party, called for the license to be revoked.
""The last thing the reef needs is more sludge dumped on it, after being slammed by the floods recently,"" she told the Guardian.
 ""One million tonnes of dumping dredged sludge into world heritage waters treats our reef like a rubbish tip.""
Image copyrightMATT CURNOCK/TROPWATER JCUImage caption
 Last week, floodwaters spread more than 60km (37 miles) offshore
It's just ""another nail in the coffin"" for the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, which is already under stress due to climate change, according to Dr Simon Boxall from the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. 
""If they are dumping it over the coral reef itself, it will have quite a devastating effect. The sludge is basically blanketing over the coral.
""The coral relies on the algae, that's what give them their colour and what helps them feed - without this partnership the coral will suffer dramatically.""
Dr Boxall says his worries about sludge-dumping are short-term - with the current Australian summer a time for ""rapid algae growth"". 
Image copyrightullstein bild/Getty Images
The North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation, which looks after Hay Point, said dumping the sludge will have a minor environmental impact. 
In a statement issued online, the corporation claimed its reports showed the risks to be ""predominantly low with some temporary short-term impacts"".
Dr Boxall says the impact will be lessened if the sludge is taken far enough offshore, but that it will still contain high amounts of harmful materials such as trace metals. 
""If it's put into shallow water it will smother sea life,"" he says.
""It's important they get it right. 
""It'll cost more money but that's not the environment's problem - that's the port authorities' problem.""
Last year, Australia pledged A$500 million (£275m) to protect the Great Barrier Reef - which has lost 30% of its coral due to bleaching linked to rising sea temperatures and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish.
One of the threats listed at the time was ""large amounts of sediment"".

 Hassan Al -Kontar (second left) and his three musketeers: Andrew Brouwer (left), Laurie Cooper (second right) and Stephen Watt (right) on a getaway to Niagara Falls
After being stranded in an airport in Malaysia for seven months, a Syrian refugee became the face of the global migrant crisis. How did he end up in Canada?
When it comes to airports, Hassan al-Kontar is something of an expert.
The Syrian spent seven months stranded in Kuala Lumpur International Airport after finding himself caught in a Catch-22 of international refugee law.
But when he landed in Vancouver at the end of November, he knew he was home. 
""The minute I put a foot in Vancouver airport, I felt the difference,"" he says.
""It was a real moment when I realised that real life can be more beautiful than the dream itself.""
To many of the thousands of people who have followed his story in the news or on social media, Kontar's arrival in Canada as a permanent resident was the perfect happy ending. 
But for him, it is only the beginning. 
And the question of what's next weighs not only on his mind but on the minds of the remarkable team of Canadians who helped rescue him.
Kontar calls them his ""three musketeers"". Laurie Cooper initiated the mission, Andrew Brouwer was his legal expert and saviour, while Stephen Watt was the Good Samaritan who visited him in the airport and helped raise awareness for his plight. 
Sitting down with all four in Toronto, it's striking how in person, Kontar is the same earnest yet self-deprecating man whose video diaries from the airport propelled him to international fame.
But after spending 56 days in a Malaysian detention centre, he is noticeably less buoyant - his slim frame has thinned further and the lines on his face make him look older now than his 37 years. 
Media captionAfter seven months stuck in an airport, Syrian man Hassan al-Kontar tells the BBC what it was like to find a new home in Canada
""His vulnerability is clear. I think people overestimate his strength because they just see the funny clips on YouTube,"" says Watt.
""We are close. The three of us are close,"" he says, eyes watering.
""For the longest time it was just getting to the finish line of getting him here and getting him safe. Now that he's here, we're able to just connect as friends so that's very, very beautiful.""
Not that there's been much time for socialising. 
The four have been doing non-stop interviews since Kontar landed, in an attempt to raise awareness about the plight of refugees around the world. . He has become a local celebrity in his new hometown of Whistler, where he is often stopped on the street for a selfie or a hearty ""welcome to Canada"".
Even his co-sponsor Cooper gained a certain brand of fame when the media honed in on the irresistible detail that she lives in a cabin in the woods, about as far away from the daily horrors of the Syrian conflict as one could get.
""I've basically been portrayed as the little old lady in the log cabin in Whistler. With the cat,"" she chuckles. ""And I'm happy with that because I just want to say anyone in Canada can make a difference.""
She first began volunteering with refugees in 2015, when a photo of the drowned body of Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi went viral. 
Kurdi had family living near Cooper in British Columbia, and the mother of two adult children suddenly felt a connection to the Syrian refugee crisis she had not had before.
""I wanted to know what I could do to help,"" she says. She has since gone on four trips to help out in refugee camps in Greece, and helped privately sponsor 21 refugees from all over the world to settle in Canada.
Canada's private sponsorship refugee system is what has made Kontar's rescue possible.

Media captionCanadian PM Justin Trudeau: 'This is a wonderful night'
While the Canadian government resettles thousands of refugees every year, it also allows private groups and individuals to sponsor individuals too.
Sponsors are responsible for raising funds to cover the first year of the refugee's life in Canada, and provide social support.
In 2018, Canada welcomed 18,000 privately sponsored refugees. But because of a backlog, only 8,500 applications are accepted each year. So the BC Muslim Association, which has a sponsorship agreement with the government, stepped in to give one of its spots to Kontar.
It typically takes years for a sponsorship application to be reviewed.
But Kontar didn't have years. He had arrived in Malaysia in 2017 after getting kicked out of the United Arab Emirates when he overstayed his work visa.
Malaysia is one of the few places in the world that allows Syrians to enter the country without a visa, but it limits their stay to 90 days. 
When that grace period expired, he tried to enter Ecuador and then Cambodia, but both countries refused to let him in. He doesn't know why.
When Cambodian officials confiscated his passport and sent him back to Malaysia last March, Kontar resigned himself to stay in the airport for the long haul. 
He feared that if he were to leave, he would be arrested by Malaysian authorities and deported back to Syria, where he could be conscripted into the army or be killed for desertion.
That was when he decided to start to tweet. 
Kontar had barely used social media before - prior to 11 March, he only had one tweet and and no Instagram presence. But he was quickly running out of money and needed legal aid, so he used the only weapons he had in his arsenal - his phone and his story.
From the beginning, his video diaries helped connect his own personal predicament to the broader crisis affecting some five million displaced Syria refugees.
""I just want to explain to the world what it feels like to be a Syrian, how it looks like, how it feels like - lonely, week, unwanted, rejected. No one is accepting us,"" he says in one video.
Those initial videos only attracted a few thousand viewers, including Cooper and Watt, who began communication with Kontar via the messaging service WhatsApp. 
But when an Al Jazeera journalist - also a refugee - sent his story to thousands of journalists worldwide, it took off.
The media blitz caught the attention of Brouwer, a public refugee lawyer in Toronto who offered to help navigate the international refugee system.
But on 2 October, more than six months after Cooper had applied to sponsor him, their worst fears came true.
Kontar was arrested by Malaysian police and taken to a detention centre.
There, he entered what Cooper describes as a ""black hole"". 
Stripped of his mobile and his eyeglasses, which he needs to see anything farther than a foot in front of him, he felt completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Every day, he says the guards taunted him by telling him he was going on a plane to Syria.
""I'm proud of myself. Even if the Malaysians were going to deport me to Syria, on one part that was okay with me because I did my best,"" he says.
""Sometimes it's better to run into the storm than away from it, he adds.
Meanwhile, Cooper, Brouwer and Watt were busy lobbying the Canadian government and Malaysian officials to let Kontar come to Canada.
And other organisations like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch got involved.

""The Canadian government, finally, it took time but they finally decided to expedite your case,"" Brouwer tells Kontar. 
""They stepped up, they really did, they moved heaven and earth to get you out of there.""
That day finally arrived when Kontar, handcuffed and flanked by eight guards, arrived on the tarmac at Kuala Lampur International Airport to board a plane to Canada.
At a layover in Taiwan, Kontar broke the news to his 22,000 followers on Instagram.
""The past is no longer with us, what is important is today and tomorrow, the present and the future,"" he says.
Now living in British Columbia, that future is wide open. 
Although a local hotel in Whistler has offered him a job, he is, with the support of Cooper and those that donated to his sponsorship, taking a little break while he figures out what he should do.
He wants to use his story to help raise awareness for refugees. Millions of Syrians are stuck in refugee camps or detention centres around the globe.
Offers to speak at schools about his experience have already started to flood in but he feels too shattered to be inspirational.
""There is a moment when I'm alone when I'm like, I'm done. I'm more total damage than healing,"" he says. ""I'm afraid I cannot deliver what they are looking for.""
What he really wants people to know is that they can help. 
""They are the real heroes,"" he says, pointing to Cooper, Brouwer and Watt. 
""Because they have options in their lives parties, music, having a family, raising their kids. Enjoy, live their life. But they decide to take another path, when a human is in need.""
As for Cooper, the ""little old lady in the log cabin"", she says if she can save a man's life, than surely anyone can.
""I think people want to help,"" she says. ""The one thing I've learned from this crisis... is ironically, it has restored my faith in humanity.""","""These are the real heroes"".

This year in March, 18 days after my little brothers 20th birthday, he died. He was out in Thailand with a few friends, four days in to his trip he had freak motorcycle accident. We dont know what happened, he had a girl on the back of his bike that he had met a few days earlier, her face collided with the back of his head, and he died, there and then on the side of the road in his best friend, Elliots arms. Billy was a bright bubbly character who was always up to mischief, but had always cared about people too. He was a non emergency care assistant and used to take dementia patients to their dialysis appointments. He had a great love of Drum &amp; Bass, Dance Music and Rap. He came with me to see your show in Bristol a few years ago. I dont really know how youre supposed to deal with loosing your best mate and your only sibling. But, as you know, you kind of just do, no matter who you have lost, the sun still rises and sets and you just have to live. The thing is, ive dealt with some crazy shit over the last few years, lost friends to suicide, got life threatening illnesses, been diagnosed as clinically depressed and now ive lost my brother. However, I dont want your sympathy, Id really like your help. We are setting up a Charity called the B A Hope Foundation and are currently waiting for our charity number to come through. The charity will help the homeless to get hot drinks throughout the year, through the use of a BillyChip. The BillyChip will be a coin that is sold by coffee shops to the public, who can then give them to the homeless at their will, so that people living on the street can redeem this at their own leisure for whatever they feel they would like be it tea or coffee. So Id like to ask you if you would be a Patron of our charity. You have a huge heart and have done lots of work for the homeless.

The musician is now a patron of male suicide prevention charity Calm and also works with the Royal Family's Heads Together charity.

 Some found the week's activities funnier than others
Here in Westminster, things haven't been ""business as usual"" for quite some time.
But this week outdid itself, with every day delivering an odd surprise - and the funny reactions to match. 
These are just some of the weird and wonderful things to have taken place in SW1A over the past five days. 
Monday: Bumday
We all know what it is like - that slow start to the week, the afternoon lull...
Then boom! Twelve naked people crash into your office and demand action on climate change.
No? Maybe it is just MPs then...
On Monday, activists took over the public gallery in the Commons during a debate on indicative Brexit votes, with slogans painted across their bodies. 
Media captionSemi-naked climate change protester on interrupting Brexit debate.
MPs courageously carried on, with the odd reference ad-libbed into their speeches and a hair-raising facial expression or two, as some of the protesters managed to glue themselves to the security glass.
It took the police a fair while to unstick the group and carry them off the premises, but the imprints of their backsides remained for some time - both on the glass and in our memories. 
Tuesday: Crack out the Chilean wine
Every week, Theresa May summons her cabinet to No 10 for a chat (row) about the latest direction of the government. 
These occasions tend to last for about two hours before the top brass can head back to their departments and maybe get on with some non-Brexit related work - Steve Barclay is exempt from this, of course. 
But on Tuesday, after ministers arrived at Downing Street, the doors were locked and they were stuck in talks for more than seven hours. 
Think what you could do with seven hours:
Watch nearly five football matches
Smash through the whole series of Bodyguard
Get a healthy amount of sleep
But no, these ladies and gentlemen had to come up with an answer to the Brexit deadlock. 
To stop them telling gossip-hungry journalists what had been decided before she did, Mrs May is said to have shut them up in the cabinet room, confiscated their phones and fed them ""cheap Chilean red wine"".
Wednesday: Message from the gods?
As Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn entered into their talks on Wednesday afternoon, it seemed the weather gods were siding with the angry Brexiteers. 
A previously fine day was shaken by a huge clap of thunder and hailstones crashing on to the pavements, despite spring being well and truly sprung. 
But the dramatic scenes in the Commons were still to come. 
For the first time in 39 years, a vote by MPs was tied.
It was on an amendment calling for backbenchers to take over business in the House for a fourth day, and the lead-up to the 310-310 result produced a lot of angry exchanges. 
So how was the impasse solved?
Mr Order himself, Speaker John Bercow, got to have the casting vote and he went against the amendment. 
Cue lots of oohs and aahs from a Commons beside itself with procedure. 
Media captionSpeaker casts deciding vote after dead heat
And the day was rounded off by an odd point of order from Tory backbencher Mark Francois after MPs approved a bill - in just one day - forcing the PM to ask the EU for an extension to Brexit. 
The staunch Leaver chose the run-up to Holy Week to exclaim: ""Forgive them Father for they know not what they do.""
The Lord does work in mysterious ways...
Thursday: Here comes the flood
The biblical theme continued into Thursday. 
As MPs debated the introduction of a loan charge, water began to pour into the press gallery above, with journalists sprinting out to avoid damp shoes. 
While the hacks were tweeting puns about ""leaks in Westminster"", politicians tried to continue and be heard over the sound of running water. 
But despite it being a somewhat busy week in Parliament, Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle was forced to suspend the House, eventually adjourning - meaning they all got an early bath. 
Media captionHouse of Commons suspends sitting due to water leak
Meanwhile, the Lords were embarking on an epic debate that saw so many votes, peers were up and down from the benches as if they had repeatedly sat on a hedgehog. 
It was a battle of Brexit, as one side tried to get Thursday's one-day bill through its peer review and the other tried to stop it. 
The players were ""dusting off camp beds"" and checking times for breakfast (07:30 BST if you were wondering), promising to debate through the night. 
But after almost 12 hours, they called it a day and went for a nightcap. 
Friday: You think it's all over...
So far, so normal. 
But there are still a few hours to go.

,"Toby Flood (right) will hope to steer Newcastle away from danger at the bottom of the Premiership
The ""business end"" of a season. A relegation dog-fight. Scrapping for points and survival. 
Pick a sporting cliche of your choice - plenty of them apply to the bottom end of the Premiership.
Eight teams are separated by just 12 points, or three wins. The bottom four, who have all won six out of 17 games this season, have just seven points between them.
To make things even more intriguing, they are some surprising names in the thick of the survival scrap, and according to former Harlequins and British Lions winger Ugo Monye, ""a giant could fall"".
BBC Sport tries its best to predict who might end up the wrong side of the table's dotted line come the last game of the season on 18 May.
How it stands
With five games left, the top four is almost sewn up with Exeter, Saracens, Gloucester and Harlequins occupying the play-off places.
Northampton, in fifth, are eight points behind Quins, but must pay equal attention to the teams below as well as the one above.
With three of their last five games against the current top four, Saints will want to ensure they don't get drawn into the mixer below, while Sale and Bath in sixth and seventh will be equally cautious.
The pack below them became even more congested because of last weekend's results that saw Worcester win at Bristol and Newcastle beat Sale.
They had a particularly big knock-on effect for another side wedged in amongst the bottom four - Leicester Tigers.
Tigers on the wrong kind of roll
The Tigers have never finished in the bottom half of the Premiership since the competition was created in 1987, but are third from bottom. 
This season, the former back-to-back European champions could be relegated and if the worst were to happen, it would make them arguably the biggest name to have dropped from English rugby's top tier in that time.
Tigers are on a woeful run of form in all competitions - just three wins in their past 19 games. 
After a humbling 29-15 home defeat by Northampton on Friday and results elsewhere, Geordan Murphy's side are just five points above bottom-placed Newcastle. 
Leicester have never finished in the bottom half of the Premiership
""It sounded ridiculous a couple of months ago to even consider one of English rugby's giants to even be in the conversation of relegation, but now it's a genuine possibility,"" Monye told BBC Radio 5 Live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast.
""Their form's been woeful. In the East Midlands derby, which I thought would be a turning point for them to have all their internationals back against their bitter rivals, I thought we'd see something different and we didn't.
""It was humbling. They looked poor, they looked rudderless at times. 
""Those are things you would associate with a team in 10th position, but you'd never think to associate it with a team like Leicester Tigers.""
'We're in the mire'
Leicester's survival could arguably be determined in their next three games.
Exeter at home, Newcastle away and Bristol at home see them face the current leaders, the current bottom-placed side and the team a place and two points above them.
Geordan Murphy was appointed full-time Leicester head coach earlier this season
""You can see we're very low on confidence,"" head coach Geordan Murphy told BBC Radio Leicester.
""We made a mistake early in the game against Northampton and our heads dropped. We just seemed to be second-best to everything.
""There's no magic pill for giving people confidence and as a result, we're in the bottom end, we're in the mire."" 
Murphy was named head coach full-time in December after an interim period in charge earlier this season and the former Tigers full-back admits the current plight is unlike anything from his playing days.
""It makes me feel horrific,"" he said. ""It's the toughest thing I've ever experienced in my life.
""I'm totally with the fans in that it's not pretty. This is our lives, it affects everything we do and it's tough to take.""
Also in the thick of it...
""The one thing I've learnt about this competition is it's not finished until the end of the season,"" Worcester director of rugby Alan Solomons said after victory at Bristol on Saturday.
Warriors have plenty of previous experience of fighting for survival since regaining their Premiership status in 2015. 
Worcester bagged a crucial win at Bristol on Saturday to stay off the bottom
They are three points above Newcastle and face arguably one of the toughest run-ins with games against two of the top four still to come.
""There's a long way to go and we need to keep the momentum going,"" Solomons told BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester.
In most Premiership seasons, six wins would probably already be enough to guarantee safety, but for Bristol Bears their fate for next season is far from certain.
Pat Lam's side are seven points above Newcastle, who they travel to face on the last day of the season, and a haul of 12 bonus points so far have helped keep their heads above water.
""We've certainly left a lot of points out on the field throughout the season,"" Lam told BBC Radio Bristol.
""You can't dwell on that, you've got to move on and there's five games to go. It's about taking the learnings and moving on to the next game.""
'Promotion and relegation is what it's all about'
What makes the current state of the Premiership even more intriguing is the backdrop of potential ring-fencing in future seasons.
Ending promotion and relegation between the Premiership and Championship would remove all the jeopardy currently being felt for the eight clubs.
""From a sporting and fans perspective, I love promotion and relegation,"" Monye said. ""I got relegated (with Harlequins in 2005) and I know the effect it can have on your personal ambition.
Newcastle have won their past three Premiership games to keep their survival hopes alive
""I know the effect it had on people who were made redundant, it is tough. But isn't that sport?
""There are winners and losers, there are consequences of all the actions you take, whether it be one match, over a season or over five years.
""They'll always be conflict when you try to merge the values of business with those of sport.
""While we celebrate the very best of the league with the teams at the top, this is why I like this league.,
""Everyone understands the relentless nature and if you're five or 10 per cent off in any match, mentally or tactically, you're going to get beaten.
""A giant could fall - just like Leicester.""
Harlequins and England scrum-half Danny Care agrees, despite having also been relegated during his career with Leeds in 2006.
""As soon as you stop it (promotion and relegation), you'll lose that competitiveness and that special thing the Premiership is,"" Care told Rugby Union Weekly.
""This year, anyone can beat anyone and it's amazing to see. As soon as you cut that off, you just lose that ambition.""",BBC Sport assesses a potential eight-way scrap for Premiership survival as teams gear up for a nervy run-in.,,2019-03-26,BBC News,Premiership: Are as many as eight teams still scrapping for survival?,

The United States announced sanctions this week that are intended to produce the most damage possible to the government of President Nicolás Maduro: the oil sector and its state company, PDVSA.
Up until now White House executive orders were only targeting government officials and certain sectors of the economy. Now new sanctions will finally hurt the one sector that is responsible for more than 90% of the government's revenues.
Many outstanding contracts are still expected to be honoured in the coming days, but new deals with PDVSA are being subjected to restrictions. From April sanctions are expected to kick in.
A new phase in the Venezuela crisis started last month when Washington recognised opposition leader Juan Guaidó - who is the leader of the National Assembly - as the rightful head of state.
Venezuela's Congress, which has been stripped of most of its powers by the government, says Mr Maduro is a ""usurper"". Washington has embarked on an open campaign with Mr Guaidó to oust Mr Maduro.
What is Washington trying to do?
The White House is trying to do a difficult thing: to make oil revenues directly reach ordinary Venezuelans and bypass the government of Mr Maduro, which owns most of the oil industry through PDVSA.
Sanctions are meant to oust Mr Maduro and lead to new elections in Venezuela.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The opposition led by Juan Guaidó is trying to set up a parallel government
US National Security Adviser John Bolton says the US wants oil revenue to reach Mr Guaidó, giving his National Assembly some economic power to combat Mr Maduro.
One of the ways of doing so is through PDVSA-owned refineries based in Texas, through a subsidiary called Citgo. Mr Bolton has already met Citgo executives and there is an effort to change its management with executives appointed by Mr Guaidó's National Assembly.
In effect the opposition is trying to set up a parallel government to Mr Maduro's with its own cabinet.
Will these sanctions hurt Maduro?
Mr Bolton said the sanctions would block $7bn (£5.4bn) in PDVSA's assets and more than $11bn in lost export proceeds over the next year.
At this stage, with Venezuela's oil output on a downward spiral and the country facing severe shortages, sanctions have the power to be ""calamitous for Venezuelan finances"", says Helima Croft from RBS Capital Markets.
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 President Nicolás Maduro still has significant support
But some analysts believe Mr Maduro still has a few options.
""The oil that Venezuela currently exports to the US will be diverted to other countries and sold at lower prices. For countries like China and India, the news was akin to Black Monday. They will be able to pick up these oil volumes at great discounts,"" writes Venezuelan-born analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, from Rystad Energy.
She adds that the impact of sanctions will be substantially lower than the ones predicted by Washington.
Venezuela exports to the US about 450,000 barrels of oil per day, a little under half of its total output. This is the amount of new oil that will flood the markets. Venezuela's market share in the US will be up for grabs, favouring Saudi, Mexican and Iraqi oil companies.
Mrs Rodriguez-Masiu says that so far, oil markets have largely shrugged off this new oversupply as investors have been pricing in Venezuela's crisis for a long time.
Who is supporting Maduro?
China and Turkey are some of the government's main allies but Russia is today seen as the key player.
Moscow has repeatedly provided financial lifelines to Caracas at times when the country was about to face serious defaults.
But it hasn't acted purely out of friendship alone.
Russia's oil company Rosneft (which itself has been subject to US sanctions since 2014 because of the Ukraine crisis) already has a 49% stake in Citgo. It also has some collateral on Citgo, which means it could seize control of the refineries in Texas were Venezuela's government to run into trouble.
Washington has its own grievances with Russia and it is not happy about the prospects of Rosneft gaining a foothold in refineries in Texas.
Will these sanctions hurt Venezuelans?
It is unclear whether the US can successfully redivert resources from Mr Maduro to Mr Guaidó.
Idriss Jazairy, a special UN rapporteur who reports to the Human Rights Council, says the people of Venezuela are the ones who will ultimately bear the brunt of sanctions.
""Sanctions which can lead to starvation and medical shortages are not the answer to the crisis in Venezuela,"" he said.
""Precipitating an economic and humanitarian crisis is not a foundation for the peaceful settlement of disputes.""
Mr Bolton said on Friday that the US would send humanitarian aid, medicine, surgical supplies and nutritional supplements for the people of Venezuela. But it is unclear whether it can successfully circumvent the Maduro government.
How long will these sanctions last?
These sanctions could last for quite a while, and they depend largely on a political solution to the stand-off between the opposition and Mr Maduro.
In the past, the US had been hesitant about imposing sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry because it knows this has the potential to seriously affect living standards of ordinary people, which are already low.
Media captionDesperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border
Now Washington is in uncharted territory, because it still has to work out in detail how to make oil revenues and humanitarian aid reach Mr Guaidó and the National Assembly.
The end goal is to force Mr Maduro out of power either through a negotiated solution or by giving incentives for a military coup.
With Mr Guaidó leading the charge with protests in Venezuela and a wide range of international support - which includes the European Union and regional players like Brazil, Argentina and Colombia - Washington hopes it won't be long before it achieves its goals.
But these sanctions could be a dangerous gamble.
In the past, US action in Venezuela helped Mr Maduro - and President Hugo Chávez before him - to rally Venezuelans behind a common enemy, giving them a temporary boost in popularity. That could be the case now.
Also, the worsening of living standards now would be directly blamed by Mr Maduro on the US. Furthermore, these actions serve the argument that Mr Maduro has been making: that Mr Guaidó is a mere puppet of the Americans.","US sanctions targeting Nicolás Maduro's government could be a dangerous gamble, says Daniel Gallas.",,2019-02-02,BBC News,Venezuela crisis: Why US sanctions on will hurt,
,"Nicky Low signed for Queen of the South in January
Scottish Cup fifth round: Aberdeen v Queen of the South
Venue: Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen Date: Sunday, 10 February Kick-off: 15:30 GMT
Coverage: Live on BBC One Scotland, BBC Radio Scotland &amp; the BBC Sport website
""We all went to the funeral. His family wanted us to take turns of carrying the coffin. We had a big poster of him in the dressing room after we continued to play games. Everyone went up and touched it before we went out.""
Less than two months after joining Derry City in January 2017, Nicky Low, his club and his city were devastated by the death of captain Ryan McBride, aged just 27.
McBride was their colossus, a local hero to fans and a totem in the Candystripes defence. One afternoon, he skippered Derry to a 4-0 thumping of Drogheda. The next, he was gone. It was a grievous and unfathomable loss.
Low will never forget those days, nor the impression McBride made on him even in so short a time.
The 27-year-old left the club last month, joining Championship side Queen of the South. On Sunday, he faces his former side Aberdeen with a place in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals at stake.
Here, the midfielder discusses the grief that engulfed Derry, bringing silverware to Pittodrie and serenading Queens' top scorer Stephen Dobbie with S Club 7.
'He was a born winner'
Low says McBride ""made me feel very welcome"" when he arrived at Brandywell Park, a ""born winner"" who set the highest of standards.
""When I first went and played a pre-season game, I wasn't having a good game, I was just trying to get through it,"" he says.
""Half-time, he was was like, 'Hey you, get a grip of yourself'. I was like, it's only a friendly. That summed him up. Playing with him was amazing because he'd win every header, every tackle. He used to tell you to get aside and he would just come right through.""
Ryan McBride was found dead in his home near Derry City's Brandywell Park home ground
The day of McBride's death is etched in his memory. The missed calls. The people waiting outside his flat. The ashen faces and swimming eyes.
""It was very weird because the city was always happy, the people were happy. He (McBride) lived a minute's walk from the stadium - you kick the ball over the bar and it could go into his garden.
""We all went to the funeral. His family wanted us to take shots of carrying the coffin. A lot of tears were shed there by me and all the lads, but you can look back and say, 'I played with him, and had the pleasure of knowing him'. And what a guy.
""He sat next to me in the changing room - he was number five and I was number six. And we had a big poster of him up after we continued to play games. Everyone went up and touched it before we went out. It was mentally tough sitting in there. You just wanted to get out, in a way. And then the fans would be singing his name which was a great thing for him, an achievement.""
'My wee brother is always singing Aberdeen songs'
Low spent five years at Pittodrie between 2010 and 2015, but was restricted to 39 appearances, all bar 11 of them as a substitute.
He found his path blocked by a barrage of established and experienced central midfielders.
Still, he came off the bench as Aberdeen won the 2014 League Cup final, scoring one of the penalties in the shoot-out as the club won their first trophy in 19 years, and played in Europa League qualifiers against Groningen and Real Sociedad.
""Sometimes I would be frustrated about not playing but I knew there were good players in front of me - Barry Robson, Willo Flood, Ryan Jack - and I just had to be patient,"" he says.
""Some of my family support Aberdeen because I was there for so long. My wee brother is always singing Aberdeen songs. It would be special to go up and win.""
Dancing for Dobbie
Stephen Dobbie scored all three goals as Queen of the South knocked out top-flight Dundee to reach the fifth round
After two years at Dundee then his sojourn with Derry, Low is back in Scottish football as Gary Naysmith's men push for promotion to the Premiership.
Spearheading their charge is 36-year-old Stephen Dobbie, the brilliant striker who has an incredible haul of 37 goals in 31 games this season.
""Dobbie's always helping young lads. He doesn't just score goals, he's big everywhere, on and off the pitch,"" the midfielder says.
The former Hibernian and Swansea City man scored a hat-trick as the Dumfries men thumped top-flight Dundee in the fourth round.
Queens are about much more than Dobbie but they know that in the veteran marksman, they have a priceless weapon in their arsenal - and, Low reveals, an unusual tactic for bringing out the best in him.
""Michael Doyle, he's a madman, he just doesn't have a minute's peace for anybody. He's always up to no good. He's a great lad and its players like that you need around you.
""Recently, he's been playing S Club 7 for Dobbie in the dressing room and dancing for him. Every time he's done that, Dobbie's scored. Doyley's got to get a bit of credit for Dobbie's goals.""","Queen of the South midfielder Nicky Low describes the pain of losing his former captain, bringing glory to Aberdeen and dancing for Stephen Dobbie.",,2019-02-10,BBC News,"Nicky Low: Death of his captain, glory at Aberdeen and dancing for Dobbie",
,"Alet-les-Bains in southern France may be a long way away from the UK, but Brexit looms large there. And it's not just the large number of Britons among its 440 residents who worry about the future. ""Our English friends have done a lot for the village,"" says resident Annick Van Mairis. ""Thanks to them, dilapidated houses have become beautiful. Our main fear is that they should have to leave for some reason or other."" In a country not renowned for being Anglophile, the warm feelings towards Alet's 60-strong British community are striking. Retired postman Gérard Baudru says they have brought ""brotherhood"" to the village - as well as work for himself. ""The number of greeting cards in in December and January is extremely high,"" he enthuses. Image caption Alet is a picturesque warren of medieval streets The mutual attraction between Alet and its British residents is rooted in geography. The village is located in Aude, the second-poorest area in mainland France. It has no industry. Its main city, Carcassonne, has half the population of Oldham in the north-west of England and five times its unemployment rate (24% to Oldham's 4.5%). Aude may be struggling economically but, attracted by the stunning scenery, the lifestyle and dirt-cheap property prices, pensioners started trickling in from Britain and other parts of northern Europe in the 1980s. When Ryanair began operating flights from London and Manchester to Carcassonne in 1998, the trickle became a flood. English not spoken Alet, a medieval spa town with a Ninth-Century abbey, caught the eye of many. One of the early arrivals, Min Stevenson, had originally planned to settle with her husband in a country house near the Pyrenees but decided on Alet instead. ""We thought, if we do that we won't feel as if we're living in France,"" she recalls. ""What I want is to be in a village. And I like the fact that people come along and say 'Hello, nice to see you'. The French people were very friendly."" Image caption Min Stevenson bought an old house in Alet in 1989 Their story is typical. British expats in Aude seek to blend in with the local culture rather than set up their own enclave. When David Goldsworthy settled in Limoux, a medium-sized town a 10-minute drive from Alet, fellow Brits were the last people he wanted to run into. ""When I heard English voices at the supermarket or Mr. Bricolage [hardware store] I went the other way. I wasn't here for that. I was here to try to become part of the landscape."" Image caption The lack of menu in English has not stopped a large number of British expats patronising L'Odalisque L'Odalisque, a Limoux restaurant, has been popular with Britons since it opened three years ago. They make up 50% of its patrons even though owner Sven Choplin does not speak a word of English. ""We tried to translate our menu at first. The English said: 'stop! This is meaningless. We'd rather make the effort.'"" he laughs. Annie Morejon - who owns the only store in the village, a grocery shop-cum-café - finds that some even out-French the French. Unlike the natives, who ""are sometimes not very polite, they come and give me a kiss"", she says. Grand designs Far from recreating Little Britain, the newcomers are busy rebuilding old France. Until the arrival of the British and others, traditional homes in villages like Alet were crumbling. ""People from Aude did not value their own heritage,"" says Catherine Pouedras, who works at the Carcassonne tourist office. Image caption Alet Mayor Ghislaine Tafforeau: The British are ""totally involved in the civic life of the village"" The newcomers eagerly bought properties to do them up. They have done so ""in a way that respects the tradition and the harmony of the village,"" Alet Mayor Ghislaine Tafforeau says. This renovation work has been ""a lesson for natives"", who she says are mainly interested in building identikit modern villas with gardens on the outskirts. One of the prettiest streets in the centre of the village, the mayor points out, is known locally as ""la rue des Anglais"". The British, says Alet resident Martine Théveniaut, ""have breathed new life into the place"". Image caption Restoration work has transformed Alet over the past three decades You will, if you try hard, find people in Alet who take exception to the British influx. Standing in a square, builders grumble about being undercut by a foreign workforce. ""The English give work to each other,"" one says. Another blames EU rules that allow ""posted workers"" to escape France's high social security contributions. But both men agree that if it were not for the British, half the houses in a nearby town would still be derelict. In the run-up to Brexit, however, fewer people have been snapping up such properties. Image caption Estate agents Christophe Bac and his father Charles have seen a sharp fall in British demand Christophe Bac, a Limoux estate agent who advertises extensively in the UK, says the fall in the pound has meant that his share of British buyers has dropped from 30% a few years ago to 15% now. Some who find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet are already selling up, Mr Bac adds. 'Anglet-les-Bains' Beyond the property market, Brexit could have consequences for the community life of villages like Alet. The most crucial British investment there has not been in stone and mortar, but in time and effort. The expats have brought to Alet an Anglo-Saxon zeal for self-help and grassroots action. Image caption The abbey of Alet was dubbed ""France's most beautiful ruin"" by 19th-Century writer Prosper Mérimée The local British brigade plays a leading role in every charity sale and village fair. They staff a workshop that makes the Alet coat of arms displayed at festivities. They have raised funds to put flowers around the village ever since the municipality's budget ran out a few years go. The Brits organise quiz nights and poetry evenings. One hosts a film club that screens alternately French and English-language films (with subtitles for each) every month. Image caption Alison Hope is gathering the paperwork to apply for a residency permit and is ""not looking forward to it"" Alison Hope settled in Alet in 2013, and bought part of a 200-year-old former nougat factory from another Briton. She is making Robin Hood costumes for the Christmas pantomime - a British tradition the expats have introduced to Alet. ""French people do go,"" she says. ""This year we're putting up signs with subtitles so they can follow the action."" ""Whenever we ask for help to set up an event, the English-speaking community is always there,"" says Jozy Laval, who heads Anim'Alet, a volunteer group. ""I like to say that this place is not Alet-les-Bains, but Anglet-les-Bains."" Image caption With the help of Brits, Jozy Laval (centre) and her Anim'Alet group are battling to keep Alet's heritage alive Deputy Mayor Jean-Pierre Gayda agrees that without them the village would have no civic life to speak of. ""I'm happy that the English are here in Alet - except during the 80 minutes of Le Crunch,"" he jokes, drawing the line at France against England at rugby. Staying on? Dawn Stollar settled in the village back in the 1980s after falling ""in love with the region"". Now a sprightly 80, she remains a leading force in Alet's civic life. A few years ago she drew up a list of emergency numbers and volunteers that sick people could call when they needed help, or have a meal brought to their home. The list was particularly useful when the Aude valley was devastated by floods in mid-October, when the equivalent of five months of rain fell in a few hours. But it is unclear how much longer Alet will benefit from Dawn's energy. She is deeply worried she will be forced to return because of Brexit. One major source of concern for retired expats like her is health coverage. Although they would continue to have access to medical care under the Brexit withdrawal deal, the future is far from certain. Image caption Dawn Stollar: ""I've never felt more insecure in my life"" And then there is money. Those living on pensions in sterling have already seen a 20% fall in their income since 2016. ""There's a limit to how much the elastic can stretch,"" Dawn says. ""I lie in bed thinking: What happens if I'm left alone and the income drops so much? What do I do? You obviously go back to your children. That would be fun wouldn't it? Grannies from all over France and Spain trooping back to England to be with their children."" ""All my life I got through everything somehow or other. But this one is coming very late in one's life, and you thought of nice old age in a beautiful place, and suddenly there is this tension."" Knock-on effects Brexit is also bad news for the local economy. As their incomes dwindle, expats are spending less. The Britons' legendary enthusiasm for do-it-yourself has meant brisk business over the years for Mr. Bricolage in Limoux. If Brexit drives many away, says store manager Gaëtan-Pierre Dumonceau, ""this would have a negative impact on our sales, and also on the villages where they are so heavily invested."" Image caption The Fairhursts have been running a B&amp;B is Alet since 2010 The travel industry, the Aude's main cash earner, is already feeling the pinch. The British are its main foreign customers and the number of those visiting camp sites in the area was down 27% between 2015 and 2017. In other words, many Britons looking for value holidays - the kind of tourism Aude specialises in - are staying away. Antoinette Fairhurst, who runs a Bed and Breakfast in Alet with a husband, notes that her income from the past summer's high season plummeted by two-thirds compared with last year. ""I hardly had any English that came,"" she says. François Raynaud of the regional tourism agency fears Brexit could make things worse, with tougher border checks. ""If the British don't come to Carcassonne that will leave a big hole,"" he says. Image caption Limoux, a few kilometres down the River Aude from Alet, is a picturesque town of some 10,000 people Aude's other money spinner is wine. The blanquette de Limoux, a bubbly that locals compare favourably to champagne, is sold worldwide, with the British among the keenest drinkers. Le Sieur d'Arques, Limoux' leading winemaker, sells to UK supermarket chains such as Tesco and Waitrose. Brexit could hit sales with extra taxes and paperwork, says Sieur d'Arques export manager Gabi van Dael. ""We are very worried about what is going to happen next year."" Image caption Françoise Antech-Gazeau heads a family firm that has made Limoux wine since the 19th Century Françoise Antech-Gazeau is head of Antech, an old Limoux family-run firm that specialises in high-end sparkling wine. Her main concern is not about the extra bureaucracy after Brexit - Antech has done business with generations of keen British customers and ""we will always find solutions"". But she fears a Brexit-induced downturn that could hit the purse of the British and lead them to drink less blanquette. Image caption Le Sieur d'Arques, the biggest Limoux winemaker, produces more than 6m bottles a year Brexit will not end the love affair between the British and Aude. The many who have moved there to work are determined to stay, and are busy getting residency permits or French citizenship. ""In terms of Brexit, you would have to shoehorn me out with a shotgun,"" says Charlotte Pye, a yoga teacher who helps kids in rugby clubs up and down the Aude valley in her spare time. ""My life is here."" But in an area with an economy on the brink, any drop in foreign income can make a big difference. And in a tiny place like Alet, the departure of even a few of its most active residents poses a threat to community life. ""Brexit is a danger for us,"" says Anim'Alet volunteer Claude Carayol.

China lands craft on Moon's far side
China has announced it's landed a spacecraft on the far side of the Moon for the first time. The unmanned Chang'e-4 probe will study the surface geology, in what state media has described as ""a major milestone in space exploration"".
The far side of the Moon - often called the ""dark side of the Moon"" - can never be seen from Earth because of what's called ""tidal locking"". This means the Moon takes the same amount of time to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth. So it's not actually dark - just unseen from Earth.
It's thought the Moon could become a source for minerals and energy. Here's why China is so interested in going there.
Two men held over Channel migrant crossings
A 33-year-old Iranian man and a 24-year-old British man have been arrested on suspicion of arranging the ""illegal movement of migrants"" across the English Channel. The National Crime Agency said they had been held in Manchester on Wednesday. It is being reported that Home Secretary Sajid Javid has requested help from the Royal Navy amid concern at a rise in Channel crossings using small vessels.

By Fergal Keane, Africa editor
Men and women, old, young and very young - beaming babies were held above the crowd - gathered at the airport in Jimma, Ethiopia, to witness the arrival of a political sensation. ""We are so very happy,"" an elderly man shouted above the military band. ""It is like a renaissance. We have waited so long for this.""
Then Abiy Ahmed was among us, descending the steps of his plane to cheers, testing the nerves of his security detail as he reached into the crowd to kiss a baby here, embrace an old man there.

,"Image copyright NAtional Museums Scotland Ten days after the Armistice ended the fighting in World War One, the British navy celebrated a decisive victory without a shot being fired when the entire German fleet surrendered in the Firth of Forth. It was the greatest gathering of warships the world had ever witnessed. Nine German battleships, five battlecruisers, seven light cruisers and 49 destroyers - the most modern ships of the German High Seas Fleet - were handed over to the Allied forces off the east of Scotland. The 70 German ships were escorted into the sheltered estuary north of Edinburgh by hundreds of Allied ships and aircraft. Image copyright NAtional Museums Scotland Image caption A photograph of the ships in the Forth taken by Charles Wright who was a photographer at East Fortune ""It must have been some sight in the Firth of Forth that day,"" says Ian Brown from the National Museums of Scotland. ""It was a sight that had never been seen before and will never be seen again,"" he says. Image copyright US Navy Art Collection Image caption The surrender of the High Seas Fleet observed from the battleship USS New York. The painting is by Bernard Gribble. Operation ZZ saw the mightiest gathering of warships in one place on one day in naval history. The man in charge was the Royal Navy's commander-in-chief Admiral Sir David Beatty. Under his command, in the early hours of 21 November 1918, the Grand Fleet began to raise steam and ease out of its moorings. Image copyright Andrew Kerr More than 40 battleships and battlecruisers set a course due east through the fog for the open water of the North Sea, about 50 miles beyond the Isle of May. They were joined by more than 150 cruisers and destroyers heading for a final rendezvous with its mortal enemy - the German High Seas Fleet. Arrangements had been made in advance for the surrender but the British navy was still ready for action and on a war footing. Image copyright Alamy Image caption The German fleet at anchor off Inchkeith after the surrender The Royal Navy was keen not to give the German fleet - the second biggest in the world - the chance to change its mind. The Germans had been instructed beforehand their guns were not to be loaded and everyone but the engine crew were to be on deck. In contrast, Admiral Beatty gave orders that his ships were to be ready for action with guns ready to be loaded at a moment's notice. Image copyright Print Collector Image caption Admiral Sir David Beatty watching the German High Seas Fleet heading for the Firth of Forth About 90,000 men of the British, American and French navies were aboard the ships. As the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet sailed into the North Sea, it formed two massive columns six miles apart. Just before 10:00 it met the Germans and their hulking crafts were led to their surrender by the British light cruiser HMS Cardiff. ""It was like a tiny little dog escorting in all these young bulls,"" says Mr Brown of the National Museums Scotland, which has a collection of photographs from the day. Image copyright Alamy Image caption Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Cardiff leading the German battle cruisers into the Firth of Forth After sailing out beyond the Isle of May, the two Allied columns swung around 180 degrees and formed an overwhelming escort on either side of the Germans as they led them back into the Firth of Forth.

By early afternoon, the German ships were anchored under guard east of Inchkeith. Image copyright Andrew Kerr Image caption An image from the Official Record showing the three flagships - Queen Elizabeth, New York and Friedrich der Grosse The rest of the British and allied fleet returned to its anchorage above and below the Forth Bridge, says Mr Kerr. He says recently-rediscovered anchorage plans for the surrender show the German ships boxed in by British battleships and cruisers, with the destroyer lines extending eastwards into Aberlady Bay. According to Mr Kerr, Rosyth in the Firth of Forth was the base for the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet. Image copyright ullstein bild Dtl. Image caption Italian liner ""Giulio Cesare"" was an escort vessel during the internment of the German fleet The fleet had been based at Scapa Flow in Orkney from the beginning of the war until the Forth was made safe enough to defend in early 1918.

Image caption Liner ""Texas"" as an escort ship during the internment of the German fleet at Firth of Forth- 1918 In a mark of the final surrender of the former enemy, Admiral Beatty issued the order for the German ensign to be taken down at sunset and not hoisted again without permission. ""That was it,"" says Mr Brown. ""'You have surrendered. You are now our prisoners'."" Mr Brown says the two largest naval fleets in the world had been incredibly important in WW1. As an island nation which was dependent on imports to feed itself, Britain had to rule the waves. Defeat at sea by Germany could have led to blockade, possible starvation and surrender. The superpower fleets had met at the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and it was ""debateable who won"", Mr Brown says. ""The Germans say they won because they sank more British ships but the British say we won because the German navy never ventured out of port again,"" he says. The Royal Navy's superiority in numbers was designed to make defeat in battle impossible and bottle up the Germans on the other side of the North Sea. According to Mr Kerr: ""Without the navy, the blockade of Germany would not have been possible. ""It was the blockade that led finally to the collapse of the German nation and the seeking of Armistice terms."" The blockade of Germany meant that by 1918 it was the Germans who were hungry, not the British. Mr Brown says: ""Just before the Armistice, the German navy had been planning to come out but there was a mass mutiny, basically the sailors refused to leave port. ""Then you have the Armistice and 10 days later you have the humiliation of having to come to one of the home ports of the Royal Navy."" ""It is the ultimate humiliation for the German High Seas fleet."" Within a week the German fleet were escorted to Scapa Flow where they were interned until June 1919. Having learned of the possible terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which would have shared the ships among the Allies, the caretaker German crew on board the ships scuttled them by opening flood valves and watertight doors and smashing water pipes. A senior German officer declared at the time that this act had wiped away the ""stain of surrender"" from the German fleet.","Ten days after the Armistice, the entire German naval fleet surrendered in the Firth of Forth.",,2018-11-21,BBC News,The day the German navy surrendered in the Forth,
,"Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder's first fight in Los Angeles in December 2018 ended in a draw
Three elite heavyweights, three underwhelming fight announcements.
Boxing's late 2018 momentum has vanished and what appeared a riveting heavyweight scene now resembles a ""disaster"", according to the BBC Radio 5 Live boxing team.
Tyson Fury and WBC world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder promised a rematch, only for an encounter to not only be put on hold but perhaps be delayed for a full calendar year.
Anthony Joshua cancelled a much-hyped booking of Wembley Stadium in April and now defends his IBF, WBO and WBA titles in New York against Jarrell Miller on 1 June.
In a four-week period from 18 May - when Wilder faces Dominic Breazeale - to 15 June - when Fury takes on Germany's Tom Schwarz - all three elite heavyweights will fight in matches few fans, if any at all, called for.
Just what on earth is happening?
A big fight in 2019? Forget it…
Tyson Fury was last to name his opponent and there is no doubt his move to join forces with broadcaster ESPN in the US in February critically complicated matters as all three men now work with different American networks, making negotiations between them far more complex.
BBC Sport boxing commentator Mike Costello: We turned into the year that we hoped would be the year of the heavyweights. They have dominated discussions but not for the right reasons. 
Judging by the response online to the announcements, fans feel it's a disaster. But as a professional boxer you have to earn the most amount of money while taking the least amount of risk and that is what they are doing.
With each of these announcements we lament that the great era we forecast may not happen.
BBC Radio 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce: Joshua, Wilder and Fury are with different broadcasters, different promoters and have different agendas. I have to say, it is a heavyweight disaster.
The big three are not going to fight one another this year, let's get that stated now. You may have heard some promoters and TV executives talking boldly, bravely and saying 'yes it can still happen'.
No, they will not fight one another this year.
A chance to change the landscape missed
Excitement peaked in the glamour division in the hours and days that followed Fury's enthralling draw with Wilder in Los Angeles. Both men spoke of a rematch, as did the WBC, only for delay to set in before Fury's ESPN move ultimately told fans to shelve plans for Wilder-Fury II.
Costello: We are hearing from Bob Arum - the legendary Top Rank promoter who works with ESPN on behalf of Fury - that there will be another Fury fight later this year that will not involve Wilder, another showcase fight. Arum is saying if Wilder v Fury happens again, it's in the early stages of next year.
Arum doesn't get a lot wrong. I just wonder what is in his thinking. We are told he has a five-fight deal with Fury and I just get the sense Arum has got it right so often in the past that maybe we have to let them have the space to build him in the States.
Bunce: I'm not a gambling man but I'd have 5p or a coffee with you that Fury and Wilder don't fight by May of next year. It is, as I say, a heavyweight disaster.
In December after their draw, Wilder and Fury had that rare thing in this sport - some moral high ground, knowing they would give us a rematch for what had thrilled us. 
That first match reconverted the US public to the heavyweights, as they had not been bothered for 20 years. Suddenly the public bought into it. If the rematch had been in April or May I am convinced it would have changed the boxing landscape. I'm convinced.
Fury owes loving fans
Costello believes Joshua has the harder of the three tasks before him, with Fury's unbeaten opponent the weakest of the three men seeking a colossal upset.
Costello: I think there was particular disappointment in the Fury opponent. The German is unbeaten in 24 fights but has little to recommend him at the highest level.
The difficulty with Schwarz may be that Fury's best displays at the highest level have been when he has had fighters coming on to him. 
I have watched Schwarz in action and sometimes he looks like he is in slow motion. So Fury will have no problem reading him. 
Bunce: Schwarz being unbeaten ticks a box, he has a six pack, that's good. But he's out of his depth. The only reason he might work is that I have a feeling that Fury may fancy trying to get on top of him, finish it quick and excite the millions watching and the thousands travelling out.
He owes it to the fans. He has spoken a great fight since he lost the weight. Now people love him and he's the peoples champion. Part of that comes from the Wilder display and part comes from a year of flawless PR. 
He has put a foot wrong with this opponent. Does he owe the public? No. But he has to perform for them. For that reason, Schwarz may be ideal.

IS teen's future
Image copyrightMet Police
Home Secretary Sajid Javid says a British woman who fled to Syria aged 15 to join Islamic State could be stopped from returning if he decides she poses a threat to the UK. One option, Mr Javid told the Times, was to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship. But under international law, it's not possible to render a person stateless, so she would have to become a national of another country for that to be legal.
Another option, as our home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani explains, is a Temporary Exclusion Order, a controversial legal tool which bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation.
Ms Begum's family have appealed for the pregnant teenager to be shown mercy. She fled with two other girls from east London in 2015 - hear what people there think of her desire to return.

'Lawless act'?
President Trump is to declare a national emergency in order to fund his border wall, having been refused the sums he wants by the US Congress. What does that mean? Well, the power is supposed to be used in a time of crisis to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets. President Trump says the flow of migrants over the Mexican border is a crisis, but others disagree - read more on that argument.
Senior Democrats have accused him of committing a ""gross abuse of power"" and a ""lawless act"". Others view it less seriously, pointing out that presidents declare emergencies surprisingly often. Will it mean the wall gets built? Maybe, but there'll be lots of legal and political challenges first.
Anthony Zurcher, our North America reporter, says this is a battle over more than just the wall - it's over who gets to set the political agenda for the next two years of the Trump presidency. If the latest development is anything to go by, Mr Trump looks like he'll try to go around Congress, not through it, to get his way.
Blow to PM
Theresa May suffered another Commons defeat on Thursday after MPs voted against a motion endorsing her negotiating strategy with Brussels. The defeat has no legal force and Downing Street said it would not change the Mrs May's approach, but our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it's still a blow. Just when the PM wanted to show the EU that she could hold her party together, a fifth of her MPs refused to support her. 
And as our Europe editor Katya Adler explains, Mrs May's struggles won't make the EU more likely to give her a helping hand. Without evidence of a comfortable majority of MPs solidly behind her efforts to renegotiate, why give ground, the logic goes, because it might be for nothing?

Chernobyl: The end of a three-decade experiment
By Victoria Gill, BBC science correspondent
""This place is more than half of my life,"" says Gennady Laptev. The broad-shouldered Ukrainian scientist is smiling wistfully as we stand on the now dry ground of what was Chernobyl nuclear power plant's cooling pond. ""I was only 25 when I started my work here as a liquidator. Now, I'm almost 60."" There were thousands of liquidators - workers who came here as part of the mammoth, dangerous clean-up operation following the 1986 explosion. The worst nuclear accident in history.

What the papers say 
There's widespread coverage of the case of Shamima Begum. The Sun calls the 19-year-old ""shameless"" and ""sickening"" and says she must never set foot in Britain again. The Daily Telegraph says forgiveness is ""out of the question"". But the Daily Mail says it accepts ""with deep reluctance"" that she is a British citizen and is our responsibility. The Times, who found the teenager in a refugee camp in Syria, has spoken to relatives who say she was young and innocent when she joined Islamic State and should now be allowed home. Elsewhere, ""May's Brexit deal in tatters... again"" is the headline in the Daily Mirror. The i says the latest defeat has fuelled doubts over whether the prime minister could get any deal through Parliament. Finally, on the end of the Airbus A380, it was a ""technological marvel"", says the Financial Times, but the superjumbo has now ""succumbed"" to hard business facts.

So now what?
The UK is due to leave the EU in just over two weeks, but on Tuesday evening MPs once again rejected Theresa May's plan for how that happens. The defeat was smaller than the first time but still huge - the backstop still the main, but not only, sticking point. As BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, it's not at all clear how the prime minister intends to dig herself out of this dreadful political hole. Or what happens next for the country as a whole. 
The immediate next step is another vote. This evening, MPs will get the chance to say whether the UK should leave without a deal on 29 March. The government is also expected to announce details of how the UK will manage its border with the Republic of Ireland in the event of no-deal, along with other contingency plans. All expectations are that MPs will vote against crashing out of the EU this month. However, the government's motion states that no-deal still remains the default option in law, and some MPs will seek to change that with an amendment that would rule out no-deal altogether.
If MPs do reject no-deal, yet another vote follows on Thursday on whether to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit. The EU has said it would need ""a credible justification"" before agreeing, and our Europe editor Katya Adler says opinion among European leaders will be divided. As far as the EU is concerned, negotiations are over, she adds, and as much as leaders want to avoid an acrimonious no-deal Brexit, they're not willing to pay just any price.
Looking at the bigger picture, could there now be another referendum? A general election? No Brexit at all? This piece looks at all the options.

Wind and rain
Weather warnings are in place for much of the UK due to Storm Gareth. Forecasters say there could be gusts of up to 80mph, and heavy rain has already led to flooding in many parts of Scotland. Further flood warnings have also been issued, mostly for north-west England. Travel has already been disrupted - ferries cancelled, rail and air passengers told to expect delays - and that will likely worsen during Wednesday and into Thursday. The second day of racing at the Cheltenham Festival was in doubt, but will go ahead.
Boeing latest
On Tuesday, the UK joined China, Australia, the EU and others in banning the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft from its airspace. However, US aviation authorities are continuing to insist there is no basis for such action and the plane is airworthy - despite mounting pressure from senators and workers' unions. It was an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed on Sunday killing 157 people, the second fatal accident involving the model in five months. Which airlines use it? Find out.

Hey, North Korea - what's up? What are you doing? As the correspondent for the Koreas, I find myself asking those questions a lot, no more so than now after the much-anticipated Hanoi summit ended without reaching a deal on denuclearisation. Most of the world's media have no free access to North Korea. The best any analyst or correspondent can do is read the signals coming from Pyongyang. And in the past week we've had a flurry of them. This has led many to believe that Kim Jong-un is reaching for the stars and is getting ready to launch a satellite.

 China has bought up a majority stake in the Greek port of Piraeus - and Italy might be next
China's president lands in Rome on Thursday, where he is expected to sign a landmark infrastructure deal that has raised eyebrows and suspicions among Italy's Western allies.
Xi Jinping's project is a New Silk Road which, just like the ancient trade route, aims to link China to Europe.
The upside for Italy is a potential flood of investment and greater access to Chinese markets and raw materials.
But amid China's growing influence and questions over its intentions, Italy's Western allies in the European Union and United States have concerns.
By land and by sea
The New Silk Road has another name - the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - and it involves a wave of Chinese funding for major infrastructure projects around the world, in a bid to speed Chinese goods to markets further afield. 
It has already funded trains, roads, and ports, with Chinese construction firms given lucrative contracts to connect ports and cities - funded by loans from Chinese banks. 
The levels of debt owed by African nations to China have raised concerns in the West - but roads and railways have been built that would not exist otherwise:
In Uganda, Chinese millions built a 50km (30 mile) road to the international airport
In Tanzania, a small coastal town may become the continent's largest port
In Europe too, Chinese firms managed to buy 51% of the port authority in Piraeus port near Athens in 2016, after years of economic crisis in Greece
Italy, however, will be the first top-tier global power - a member of the G7 - to take the money offered by China. 
It is one of the world's top 10 largest economies - yet Rome finds itself in a curious situation. 
The collapse of the Genoa bridge in August killed dozens of people and made Italy's crumbling infrastructure a major political issue for the first time in decades.
And Italy's economy is far from booming.
The country slipped into recession at the end of 2018, and its national debt levels are among the highest in the eurozone. Italy's populist government came to power in June 2018 with high-spending plans but had to peg them back after a stand-off with the EU.
It is in this context that China's deal is being offered - funding that could rejuvenate Italy's grand old port cities along the Maritime Silk Road.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has mentioned the cities of Trieste and Genoa as likely candidates.
""The way we see it, it is an opportunity for our companies to take the opportunity of China's growing importance in the world,"" said Italy's undersecretary of state for trade and investment, Michele Geraci.
""We feel that amongst our European partners, Italy has been left out. We have wasted a little bit of time,"" he told the BBC.
So what's in it for China?
Italy's move is ""largely symbolic"", according to Peter Frankopan, professor of Global History at Oxford University and a writer on The Silk Roads.
But even Rome admitting the BRI is worth exploring ""has a value for Beijing"", he said.
""It adds gloss to the existing scheme and also shows that China has an important global role.""
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 President Xi Jinping has made the BRI a flagship policy
""The seemingly innocuous move comes at a sensitive time for Europe and the European Union, where there is suddenly a great deal of trepidation not only about China, but about working out how Europe or the EU should adapt and react to a changing world,"" Prof Frankopan told the BBC.
""But there is more at stake here too,"" he added. ""If investment does not come from China to build ports, refineries, railway lines and so on, then where will it come from?""
Ahead of his arrival, President Xi declared that the friendship between the two nations was ""rooted in a rich historical legacy"".
""Made in Italy has become synonymous with high quality products. Italian fashion and furnishings fully meet the taste of Chinese consumers; pizza and tiramisu are liked by young Chinese people,"" he wrote in an article published by Corriere della Sera.
Image copyright Oxford Science Archive/Getty ImagImage caption
 Explorer Marco Polo's travels along the Silk Road were immortalised in the ""Book of Marvels""
That ""made in Italy"" label carries a reputation for quality worldwide, and is legally protected for products items processed ""mainly"" in Italy. 
In recent years, Chinese factories based in Italy using Chinese labour have been challenging that mark of quality. 
Better connections for cheap raw materials from China - and the return of finished products from Italy - could exaggerate that practice.
""Predatory"" investment
The non-binding deal being signed by the two countries on Thursday comes amid questions over whether Chinese firm Huawei should be permitted to build essential communications networks - after the United States expressed concern they could help Beijing spy on the West.
That is not part of the current negotiations in Italy.
But a little over a week before the deal was due to be signed, the European Commission released a joint statement on ""China's growing economic power and political influence"" and the need to ""review"" relations.
As President Xi tours Rome, EU leaders in Brussels will be considering 10 points for relations with China.
While they include deepening engagement, they also involve plans to ""address the distortive effects of foreign state ownership"" as well as ""security risks posed by foreign investment in critical assets, technologies and infrastructure"".
In March, US National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis pointed out that Italy was a major economy and did not need to ""lend legitimacy to China's vanity infrastructure project"".
Members of Italy's ruling right-wing League party have their owns concerns about national security
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini warned that he did not want to see foreign businesses ""colonising"" Italy.
""Before allowing someone to invest in the ports of Trieste or Genoa, I would think about it not once but a hundred times,"" Salvini warned.
Setting the scene
Italian officials are keen to point out that the deal being signed is not an international treaty, and is non-binding.
""There are no specific projects,"" Mr Geraci said. ""It is more of an accord that sets the scene.""
Other European nations already accept Chinese investment through something called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, he said - something the UK was the first to sign up to.
Media captionWhat China's One Belt, One Road really means
""And then one by one, France, Germany, Italy and everyone else also followed suit,"" Mr Geraci said.
Similarly, he believes Italy's neighbours will soon follow it into the Belt and Road initiative.
""I do believe that this time Italy is actually leading Europe - which I understand may be a surprise to most,"" he added.",Italy is ready to let Chinese money build its infrastructure - but its allies remain sceptical.,,2019-03-21,BBC News,Italy takes a shine to China's New Silk Road,

Tens of thousands of people die from snake bites worldwide every year. Lack of treatment and even the wrong medicine mean many of these deaths are preventable.
Snake bites may not strike you as being a major public health problem. 
But in some parts of the world they are a daily risk, and can be lethal or life-changing. 
Victims often do not get the treatment they need in time, if at all. 
In other cases, they are given medicine to treat an injury caused by a different snake. 
About 11,000 people a month are thought to die from venomous snakebites - similar to the number that died during the whole of the 2014-16 West Africa Ebola crises.
A further 450,000 people a year are thought to suffer life-changing injuries such as amputation and permanent disability.
The scale of the problem means snake bites are now classed as a priority neglected tropical disease.
Who gets bitten? 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Children walking to school can be at risk of snake bite
In developed regions - such as Europe, Australia and North America - snake bites kill only a handful of people each year, despite there being many venomous species. 
That is compared with 32,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, and twice as many in South Asia.
Many rural communities in the tropics are at almost constant risk of snake bites, whether working in the field, travelling at dusk or even sleeping in their homes at night.
Young male farmers are the most at-risk group, followed by children.
While a large rural population is a factor, health systems in some parts of Africa and Asia are often ill-prepared for coping with snake bites. 
Clinical training, emergency transport and affordable medicine are often in short supply, with tragic consequences. 
Expensive medicine
Venomous snake bites typically cause three main types of life-threatening symptoms: uncontrollable bleeding, paralysis and irreversible tissue destruction.
It is essential for snakebite victims to get the correct medicine as soon as possible following a snake bite.
Antivenom is the medicine of choice for treating snake bites.
It is made using the venom of the snake it is designed to treat.
This means that many different versions are needed, because there are so many venomous snakes found throughout the world - cobras, mambas, kraits, vipers and pit vipers, to name just a few.
The toxins found in their venom differ from one group of snakes to the next, or even between the same group of snakes in a different region. 
This means the correct antivenom is often hard to identify and can be very expensive.
How antivenoms are made
A tiny non-harmful amount of snake venom is injected into an animal - usually a horse, or sheep
This stimulates the animal's immune system to create antibodies that neutralise the venom 
These antibodies are extracted from the animal's blood, purified and made into antivenom
Antivenoms must be used in hospital because of patients suffering a high rate of adverse reactions to the medicine
In Latin America, antivenom is often produced in the country and subsidised by the government.
Death rates are significantly higher in sub-Saharan Africa, where the best antivenom costs $140 to $300 (£108 to £233) per vial, with three to 10 vials usually required to save a victim's life. 
As the typical Swazi farmer earns $600 a year, this medicine out of reach for most.
The wrong antivenom
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 A juvenile pit viper
This situation has allowed weak or inappropriate medicine to flood the market over the past decade, particularly in Africa. 
These antivenoms often cost about $30 per vial - a fraction of the cost of proven products. 
Some African health ministries understandably saw this as a win-win situation, with more drugs available and at a lower cost.
These products started being used in hospitals throughout much of the continent.
However, there are now several reports that some of these medicines may be dangerously ineffective. 
Small-scale case studies from hospitals in both Ghana and Central African Republic have suggested that when these cheaper medicines were used, fatality rates increased from 2% or fewer, to more than 10%.
Often, these antivenoms are made using snake venoms from a different region to where the product is being sold - for example an antivenom made with Indian snake venom being used in Africa. 
Others are made with the right venoms, but with a low concentration of antibodies per dose - resulting in very weak medicines. 
This means the number of vials needed to successfully treat the patient shoots up from three to 10, to as many as 20 or 30.
Ironically, this situation has prompted some established manufacturers to cut supply of their much-needed products as they became priced out of the market.
Lack of testing
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 An eyelash viper
These problems have been made worse by the lack of antivenom testing.
Most drugs have to be thoroughly independently tested, with clinical trials to prove their effectiveness. 
But this often is not the case with antivenom. National drug agencies sometimes approve products without strong evidence of their effectiveness, or comparison with existing treatments.
To tackle this, the World Health Organization has launched a pre-market testing scheme, with the results due to be published later this year.
This should allow health ministries, pharmacists and clinicians to better understand which antivenoms are suitable for their region, while identifying responsible manufacturers of affordable antivenoms. 
However, manufacturers do not have to take part in the scheme, and countries are not obliged to remove products from the market based on the results.
Nevertheless, it is hoped that this World Health Organization seal of approval will strongly influence antivenom purchasing decisions throughout Africa. 
More stories like this
Looking to the future
Effective antivenom is one part of solving the snake bite puzzle, but many other challenges remain.
More work needs to be done to identify the communities most at risk and to ensure a sustainable flow of affordable medicine is sent there.
Meanwhile, training more clinicians and healthcare workers in how to effectively treat snake bite victims would reduce the number of deaths.
Finally, educating local communities about snake bites would help lower the risk of being bitten, and mean appropriate action was more likely to be taken after a bite.

 About 2,000 specimens at the Pitt Rivers Museum are of human remains
Treasures seized during Britain's colonial past are kept in museums across the country. But as times change, how do such institutions deal with the sensitive issue of the human remains in their collections?
In Oxford, the Pitt Rivers Museum - founded with the collection of a Victorian general, Augustus Pitt Rivers - holds about 2,000 such specimens. 
These body parts were brought back to Britain from across its empire, with little concern for the people from whom they'd been plundered. 
The Pitt Rivers is one of several British institutions that are under pressure to re-evaluate the many colonial prizes in their collections.
""We can't undo history but we can be a part of the process of healing,"" says Laura van Broekhoven, director of the museum.
She says the process is about having an ""open conversation"" with those affected.
Image copyrightAlamyImage caption
 The museum was founded with the collection of Victorian general Augustus Pitt Rivers
Since the passing of the Human Tissues Act 2004, legislation that relaxed the rules regarding the moving of body parts, the Pitt Rivers has returned 22 such objects.
It's hardly a flood of returns to the former colonies, but it's a start.
The Pitt Rivers is currently negotiating the return of aboriginal human remains to Australia, and in May 2017 Maori remains were handed over to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.
In some cases these items first came to the UK because of adventurers who had connections to the University of Oxford.
""We've a lot of family connections between the university and the people of New Zealand that date back to the first contact between the Maori and British voyagers,"" Dr van Broekhoven explains. 
""When the first British ships went to the area there were people from Oxford - wealthy naturalists who bought themselves a place on the ship that Captain Cook was navigating - and they brought objects here.""
She says the Maori community showed ""persistence and dedication"" in getting them back.

 Repatriations enable the ""reconciliation of past wrongs and misdeeds""
Te Herekiekie Herewini, who works at Te Papa, has been described as the country's Indiana Jones of repatriations.
His mission is to return remains to their spiritual homeland ""as a means of ensuring the ancestors may be comforted and embraced by their loved ones"". 
He says: ""Maori and Moriori ancestral remains were taken without the permission of their family, and so the repatriation process allows for reconciliation of past wrongs and misdeeds associated with the arrival of Europeans into the South Pacific.""
The museum has claimed back about 500 skeletal remains from various institutions since 2003, and the handover last year from Oxford included seven Toi moko, which are mummified, tattooed heads of Maori origin.
In May 2017 they were formally welcomed home by tribal representatives and government officials, and placed in a sacred repository, known as a Wahi Tapu.
The are only open only to tribal representatives with a direct genealogical connection to them. 
And what's happened to some of the Pitt Rivers' remains has been replicated elsewhere. The British Museum, which has more than 6,000 human remains in its collections, has repatriated at least 18 objects to Tasmania and New Zealand since 2004.

2,000 individual objects
300 skulls, or parts of skulls
600 human bones, or artefacts incorporating them
700 specimens of human hair, or artefacts using it
Ashley Jackson, professor of Imperial and military history at King's College, believes if the situation was reversed, there would be strong feelings in the UK. 
""If a museum in Beijing or Harare had the remains or funeral regalia of an important king or archbishop there'd be an enormous movement to try and get them back here,"" he says.
The current predicament is down to attitudes in the colonial period being extremely different, he says.
""Many people had an extraordinarily proprietorial view of the wider world, representing what many would've seen as a higher civilisation discovering, claiming, archiving, and bringing things back to Britain.""

He adds: ""There must be an argument for a very human approach to understanding why certain communities, groups or national institutions want to have these back. 
""They want to reclaim a history we had in many ways appropriated, and pronounced upon, and written about in a way that might not have reflected the truth.""
But for Dr Tiffany Jenkins, author of Contesting Human Remains in Museum Collections: The Crisis of Cultural Authority, there now seems to be a ""confusion in terms of what a museum's purpose is"".
""Once it gets involved in community work, it's doing something slightly different, and I think in a way betraying its knowledge-seeking and educative purpose,"" she says. 
""I'm uncomfortable when they abandon that because I think this has come out of a search for something new to do to make them relevant in the 21st Century. 
""It moralises and apologises rather than investigates and opens it up... the beautiful thing about knowledge and understanding the past is that it should be open to everybody.""

Europe - 400

Among the Pitt Rivers' most popular exhibits are the ""shrunken heads"". 
The 10 tsantsas were brought back from the Upper Amazon by British explorers in the late 19th Century, and now reside in a case called ""Treatment of Dead Enemies"".
To make a tsantsa the skin was removed, boiled and dried, the eyes and mouth closed with cotton string, the face blackened with dye, and the head strung on a cord.
These trophies were created by the tribesmen who took their enemies' heads to prove their courage and avenge a death. 
We can't show a photograph of them because the museum considers them ""sensitive materials"" - to their descendants they are sacred objects.
Image caption
 At one point demand in the West was so high that tsantsas were made from people who had died of natural causes
But that doesn't necessarily mean they shouldn't be on display at the museum, explains Dr van Broekhoven. She says she has spoken to descendants of the Amazonian tribespeople, who had ""no problem whatsoever"" with the collections.
""They're actually very glad to see them on display,"" she says.
""They see that as a representation of their cultures and ambassadors for their cultures here.
""So in that sense I don't necessarily see the vaults opening and emptying as the only possible outcome of this process.""
Image copyrightAlamyImage caption
 The museum's director says most of the museum's collections are uncontroversial
A link-up with another community took place in November, when Maasai representatives from Tanzania and Kenya visited the museum.
They worked with curators to make sure exhibits were correctly labelled and that they represented their culture fairly.
Dr van Broekhoven believes entering into the sprit of conversation with interested parties is important. 
""I can't see how we would otherwise progress, especially as Oxford is a very international city,"" she says. 
Despite its complicated past, Dr van Broekhoven insists the museum can still ""speak about our common humanity"".
""There's many different ways of knowing and being,"" she says. 
""There's so much to learn from each other, and understand from each other.""",Can a museum justify keeping human remains that were plundered by Victorian adventurers?,,2019-01-29,BBC News,Pitt Rivers: The museum that's returning the dead,
